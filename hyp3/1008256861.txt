the aim of this expedition was to weaken the power of the timor kings and even as this expedition was made by the topasses , the 'black portuguese ' , it succeeded to extend the portuguese influence into the interior of the country the definitive border was drawn by the hague in 1914 , and it remains the international boundary between the modern states of east timor and indonesia although portugal was neutral during world war ii , in december 1941 , portuguese timor was occupied by australian and dutch forces , which were expecting a japanese invasion when the japanese did occupy timor , in february 1942 , a 400-strong dutch-australian force and large numbers of timorese volunteers engaged them in battle of timor ( 1942–43 ) this was partly as indonesia was preoccupied with gaining control of west irian , now called papua , which had been retained by the netherlands after indonesian independence a civil war between supporters of portuguese timorese political parties , fretilin and the udt , broke out in 1975 as udt attempted a coup which fretilin resisted with the help of local portuguese military one of the first acts of the new government in lisbon was to appoint a new governor for the colony on 18 november 1974 , in the form of mário lemos pires , who would ultimately be , as events were to prove , the last governor of portuguese timor three main political parties were formed : the união democrática timorense ( udt , timorese democratic union ) , was supported by the traditional elites , initially argued for a continued association with lisbon , or as they put it in tetum , mate bandera hum — 'in the shadow of the portuguese flag ' , but later adopted a 'gradualist ' approach to independence one of its leaders , mário viegas carrascalão , one of the few timorese to have been educated at university in portugal , later became indonesian governor of east timor during the 1980s and early 1990s , although with the demise of indonesian rule , he would change to supporting independence other smaller parties included klibur oan timur asuwain ( kota , tetum for 'sons of the mountain warriors ' ) , which sought to create a form of monarchy involving the local liurai , and the partido trabalhista ( labour party ) , but neither had any significant support suharto 's '' new order '' , which had effectively eliminated indonesia 's communist party pki in 1965 , was alarmed by what it saw as the increasingly left-leaning fretilin , and by the prospect of a small independent leftist state in the midst of the archipelago inspiring separatism in parts of the surrounding archipelago at a meeting in the javanese town of wonosobo in 1974 , he told suharto that an independent portuguese timor would be 'an unviable state , and a potential threat to the stability of the region' during the course of 1975 , portugal became increasingly detached from political developments in its colony , becoming embroiled in civil unrest and political crises , and more concerned with decolonisation in its african colonies of angola and mozambique than with portuguese timor governor pires fled to the offshore island of atauro , north of the capital , dili , from where he later attempted to broker an agreement between the two sides indonesia sought to portray the conflict as a civil war , which had plunged portuguese timor into chaos , but after only a month , aid and relief agencies from australia and elsewhere visited the territory , and reported that the situation was stable in october 1975 , in the border town of balibo , two australian television crews ( the '' balibo five '' ) reporting on the conflict were killed by indonesian forces , after they witnessed indonesian incursions into portuguese timor while fretilin had sought the return of the portuguese governor , pointedly flying the portuguese flag from government offices , the deteriorating situation meant that it had to make an appeal to the world for international support , independently of portugal on 28 november 1975 , fretilin made a unilateral declaration of independence of the democratic republic of east timor ( república democrática de timor-leste in portuguese ) this was not recognised by either portugal , indonesia , or australia ; however , the udi state received formal diplomatic recognition from six countries that were led by leftist or marxist–leninist parties , namely albania , cape verde , guinea , guinea-bissau , mozambique , and são tomé and príncipe indonesia 's response was to have udt , apodeti , kota and trabalhista leaders sign a declaration calling for integration with indonesia called the balibo declaration , although it was drafted by indonesian intelligence and signed in bali , indonesia not balibo , portuguese timor an international east timor solidarity movement arose in response to the 1975 invasion of east timor by indonesia and the occupation that followed the movement was most extensive in neighbouring australia , in portugal , in the philippines and the former portuguese colonies in africa , but had significant force in the united states , canada and europe a lot of rape were also taking place a detailed statistical report prepared for the commission for reception , truth and reconciliation in east timor cited a lower range of 102,800 conflict-related deaths in the period 1974–1999 , namely , approximately 18,600 killings and 84,200 'excess ' deaths from hunger and illness by february 1976 , with troops spreading out from the capital to occupy villages to the east and south , east timor 's indonesian-appointed deputy governor , lopez la cruz , admitted that 60,000 east timorese had been killed attempts by the united nations secretary general 's special representative , vittorio winspeare-guicciardi to visit fretilin-held areas from darwin , australia , were obstructed by the indonesian military , which blockaded east timor on 31 may 1976 , a 'people 's assembly ' in dili , selected by indonesian intelligence , unanimously endorsed an 'act of integration ' , and on 17 july , east timor officially became the 27th province of the republic of indonesia ( timor timur ) the occupation of east timor remained a public issue in many nations , portugal in particular , and the un never recognised either the regime installed by the indonesians or the subsequent annexation we can refer to the resolution approved by the united nations general assembly on 12 december 1975 , saying '' having heard the statements of the representatives of portugal , as the administering power , concerning developments in portuguese timor.deplores the military intervention of the armed forces of indonesia in portuguese timor and calls upon the government of indonesia to withdraw without delay its armed forces from the territory.and recommends that the security council take urgent action to protect the territorial integrity of portuguese timor and the inalienable right of its people to self-determination '' indeed , they supported it by selling arms or making offerings of aid ( it is believed that the united states provided 90 % of indonesia 's arms ) , by making some military training programs in indonesia , by not covering the events taking place in timor , or by saying that the deaths were due to former conflicts with the event captured on film and aired around the world , the embarrassed indonesian government admitted to 19 killings , although it 's estimated that over 200 died in the massacre timorese groups fought a campaign of resistance against indonesian forces for the independence of east timor , during which many atrocities and human rights violations by the indonesian army were reported foreign powers such as the australian government , concerned to maintain good relations with indonesia , had been consistently reluctant to assist a push for independence ( despite popular sympathy for the east timorese cause among many in the australian electorate ) however , the departure of president suharto and a shift in australian policy by the howard government in 1998 precipitated a proposal for a referendum on the question of independence right the massacre had a profound effect on public opinion in portugal , especially after television footage showing east timorese praying in portuguese , and independence leader xanana gusmão gained widespread respect , being awarded the portugal 's highest honour in 1993 , after he had been captured and imprisoned by the indonesians prime minister keating 's first overseas trip was to indonesia in april 1992 and sought to improve trade and cultural relations , but repression of the east timorese continued to mar co-operation between the two nations gareth evans and prime minister paul keating ( 1991–1996 ) gave maintenance of close relations with the indonesian government a high priority , as did the subsequent prime minister john howard and foreign minister alexander downer during their first term in office ( 1996–1998 ) while just 20 % of east timorese called themselves catholics in 1975 , the figure surged to reach 95 % by the end of the first decade after the invasion upon his arrival in east timor , the pope symbolically kissed a cross then pressed it to the ground , alluding to his usual practice of kissing the ground on arrival in a nation , and yet avoiding overtly suggesting east timor was a sovereign country in 1996 , bishop carlos filipe ximenes belo and josé ramos-horta , two leading east timorese activists for peace and independence , received the nobel peace prize for '' their work towards a just and peaceful solution to the conflict in east timor '' in 1998 , following the resignation of suharto and his replacement by president habibie , jakarta moved towards offering east timor autonomy within the indonesian state , although ruled out independence , and stated that portugal and the un must recognise indonesian sovereignty the referendum , held on 30 august , gave a clear majority ( 78.5 % ) in favour of independence , rejecting the alternative offer of being an autonomous province within indonesia , to be known as the special autonomous region of east timor ( saret ) the majority of the country 's infrastructure , including homes , irrigation systems , water supply systems , and schools , and nearly 100 % of the country 's electrical grid were destroyed the opposition spokesman on foreign affairs , labor 's laurie brereton , was vocal in highlighting evidence of the indonesian military 's involvement in pro-integrationist violence and advocated united nations peacekeeping to support the east timor 's ballot finally , on 11 september , bill clinton announced : indonesia , in dire economic straits relented and on 12 september , indonesian president habibie announced : it was clear that the un did not have sufficient resources to combat the paramilitary forces directly instead , the un authorised the creation of a multinational military force known as interfet ( international force for east timor ) , with security council resolution 1264 on 20 september 1999 the australian-led peacekeeping troops of the international force for east timor ( interfet ) deployed to the country and brought the violence to an end the administration of east timor was taken over by the un through
