despite this being a low wage for hard labour , even in some of the countries with the lowest wages , it represents an energy cost that is significantly more expensive than even exotic power sources such as solar photovoltaic panels ( and thus even more expensive when compared to wind energy harvesters or luminescent solar concentrators ) 1 liter of fuel yielding 100 arms for 24 hours , when efficiency is 40 % which is never home documentary by yann arthus bertrand too stating that 1 liter of fuel yields 100 arms for 24 hours ; probably from same calculation in addition , the combined work capability of a human is also much lower than that of a machine powered transportation equipment such as locomotives , automobiles and trucks and airplanes , is a classification of machinery which includes sub classes by engine type , such as internal combustion , combustion turbine and steam many of the early machines and machine tools were hand powered , but most changed over to water or steam power by the early 19th century the term is also used in the military to refer to the use of tracked armoured vehicles , particularly armoured personnel carriers , to move troops that would otherwise have marched or ridden trucks into combat this implies that a gang of 20 to 40 men will require a financial compensation for their work at least equal to the required expended food calories ( which is at least 4 to 20 times higher ) in the mid to late 19th century , hydraulic and pneumatic devices were able to power various mechanical actions , such as positioning tools or work pieces when we compare the efficiency of a labourer , we see that he has an efficiency of about 1 % -5.5 % ( depending on whether he uses arms , or a combination of arms and legs ) for example , it takes more than one and a half hour of hard labour to deliver only one kwh - which a small engine could deliver in less than one hour while burning less than one litre of petroleum fuel when we compare the costs of using an internal combustion engine to a worker to perform work , we notice that an engine can perform more work at a comparative cost the fourdrinier paper machine paper machine for continuous production of paper was patented in 1801 , displacing the centuries-old hand method of making individual sheets of paper electric-controlled powered tools , single functioned , fixed cycle powered tools , multi-functioned , program controlled powered tools , remote-controlled powered tools , activated by work-piece ( e.g an average human worker can provide work good for around 0,9 & nbsp ; hp ( 2.3 mj per hour ) while a machine ( depending on the type and size ) can provide for far greater amounts of work water powered bellows for blast furnaces , used in china in ancient times , were in use in europe by the 15th century the industrial revolution started mainly with textile machinery , such as the spinning jenny ( 1764 ) and water frame ( 1768 ) demand for metal parts used in textile machinery led to the invention of many machine tools in the late 1700s until the mid-1800s bulk material handling systems and equipment are used for a variety of materials including coal , ores , grains , sand , gravel and wood products
