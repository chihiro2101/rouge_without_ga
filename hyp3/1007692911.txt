unlike many other portrayals of the legend of sir galahad , tennyson has sir galahad speak in the first person , gives the reader his thoughts and feelings as he rides on his quest , rather than just the details of his battles , as in malory in a christmas mystery , written more than twenty years after tennyson 's sir galahad , galahad is '' fighting an internal battle between the ideal and the human , '' and tries to reconcile his longing for earthly delights , such as the romantic exploits of sir palomydes and his father sir lancelot , and the '' more austere spiritual goal to which he has been called galahad , in both the lancelot-grail cycle and in malory 's retelling , is exalted above all the other knights : he is the one worthy enough to have the holy grail revealed to him and to be taken into heaven just as in le morte d'arthur , galahad grows up in the court of his mother elaine and travels to king arthur 's court to be reunited with his father and to become a knight a poem by thomas de beverly published in 1925 , '' the birth of sir galahad '' , tells of the events leading up to the conception of sir galahad , his birth and a visit soon afterwards by sir bors , to see elaine and the baby galahad galahad is then brought to king arthur 's court at camelot during pentecost , where he is accompanied by a very old knight who immediately leads him over to the round table and unveils his seat at the siege perilous , an unused chair that has been kept vacant for the sole person who will succeed in the quest of the holy grail sir galahad 's thoughts and aspirations have been explored as well by william morris in his poems the chapel in lyoness , published in 1856 , and sir galahad , a christmas mystery , sir galahad , a christmas mystery camelot project published in 1858 in thomas malory 's le morte d'arthur , galahad 's incredible prowess and fortune in the quest for the holy grail are traced back to his piety of the three knights who are untainted by sin – sir perceval , sir bors , and sir galahad – galahad is the only one predestined to achieve this honour of attaining the holy grail in ayn rand 's novel we the living , the character andrei taganov , an honest and idealistic revolutionary communist , sacrifices his career and resorts to blackmail in order to save the life of leo , the lover of kira—the woman that andrei loves ; though hating leo and intensely jealous of him , andrei puts kira 's happiness before his own galahad does not feature in any romance by chrétien de troyes , or in robert de boron 's grail stories , or in any of the continuations of chrétien 's story of the mysterious castle of the fisher king in most versions of the story of sir galahad , galahad 's death comes about after his greatest achievement , that of the holy grail in the french tale used by thomas malory , king pelles has already received magical foreknowledge that lancelot will give his daughter a child and that this little boy will grow to become the greatest knight in the world , the knight chosen by god to discover the holy grail david is the self-appointed leader of the protagonists and takes on all the burdens of the group , being troubled by his past in which he was cowardly and feeling he must prove himself to be a man – in which could be seen some parallels with galahad 's life on discovering the deception , lancelot draws his sword on elaine , but when he finds out that they have conceived a son together , he is immediately forgiving ; however , he does not marry elaine or even wish to be with her any more and returns to arthur 's court the story of galahad and his quest for the holy grail is a relatively late addition to the arthurian legend galahad survives this test , witnessed by arthur who , upon realising the greatness of this new knight , leads him out to the river where a magic sword lies in a stone with an inscription reading '' never shall man take me hence but only he by whose side i ought to hang ; and he shall be the best knight of the world a comical approach to the legend of sir galahad , his quest for the holy grail , and his pure character is made to seem foolish galahad is promptly invited to become a knight of the round table , and soon afterwards , arthur 's court witnesses an ethereal vision of the grail in the 2015 video game the order : 1886 , the main character is an heir to the title of sir galahad , and is therefore referred to as such the tale of the sankgreal , briefly drawn out of french , which is a tale chronicled for one of the truest and one of the holiest that is in this world galahad 's success in the high religious endeavour that was the search for the holy grail was predicted before his birth , not only by pelles but also by merlin , who once had told uther pendragon that there was one who would fill the place at the '' table of joseph '' , but that he was not yet born while in a specific sense , this '' purity '' refers to chastity , galahad appears to have lived a generally sinless life and so as a result , he lives and thinks on a level entirely apart from the other knights around him at the very beginning of the story , as a denizen of a parallel world , he encounters cirilla of cintra and calls her the lady of the lake destiny will have to be helped along a little ; therefore , a conclusion which prompts pelles to seek out '' one of the greatest enchantresses of the time , '' dame brusen , who gives pelles a magic ring that makes elaine take on the appearance of guinevere and enables her to spend a night with lancelot this text gives a detailed discourse covering galahad 's life story from his birth to his death , with specific emphasis on his contribution to the quest for the holy grail for the most part he travels alone during the grail quest , smiting ( and often sparing ) his enemies , rescuing fellow knights including percival and saving maidens in distress , until he is finally reunited with bors and percival '' tennyson 's poem follows galahad 's journey to find the holy grail but ends while he is still riding , still seeking , still dreaming ; as if to say that the quest for the holy grail is an ongoing task galahad 's conception is later glossed by malory in le morte d'arthur : '' and so by enchantment elaine won the love of lancelot , and certainly she loved him again passing well galahad pursues a single-minded and lonely course , sacrificing much in his determination to aspire to a higher ideal : then move the trees , the copses nod , / wings flutter , voices hover clear / '' o just and faithful knight of god ! / ride on ! the prize is near pelles , galahad 's maternal grandfather , is portrayed as a descendant of joseph of arimathea 's brother-in-law bron also known as galahad ( galaad ) , whose line had been entrusted with the grail by joseph merlin brings lancelot back with him , and after the sorrows that subsequently befall camelot , the lady of the lake reveals that merlin was meant to pick galahad , and that his mistake proves how human he truly is '' in the companion piece the chapel in lyoness , a knight lies dying in winter '' in a bizarre realization of galahad 's nightmare vision of his own fate '' when galahad arrives at the court , guinevere is upset with lancelot because he does not want to be her lover any more and she takes an interest in the young knight , persuading him to go above and beyond regular knightly duties so it is , while making his way back to arthur 's court , galahad is visited by joseph of arimathea , and thus experiences such glorious rapture that he makes his request to die this quality is reflected in alfred , lord tennyson 's poem '' sir galahad '' : my good blade carves the casques of men , / my tough lance thrusteth sure , / my strength is as the strength of ten , / because my heart is pure the young galahad is born and placed in the care of a great aunt , who is an abbess at a nunnery , to be raised there the movie makes a satire of galahad 's purity as his chastity is put to the test when he finds a castle full of sexually charged nuns in the film kingsman : the secret service and its sequel , galahad is the code name of colin firth 's character harry hart , later assumed by taron egerton 's character , gary '' eggsy '' unwin
