by 1403 only a handful of castles , including harlech , still stood against the rebels , but the castle was under-equipped and under-staffed to withstand a siege , the garrison having just three shields , eight helmets , six lances , ten pairs of gloves , and four guns in 1408 english forces under the command of the future henry v placed harlech and its commander , edmund mortimer , under siege , conducting a bombardment with cannon , probably destroying the south and east parts of the outer walls ; in the 15th century , harlech was involved in the series of civil wars known as the wars of the roses that broke out between the rival factions of the house of lancaster and york in 1460 , following the battle of northampton , queen margaret of anjou fled to the castle and between 1461â€“68 it was held by her lancastrian supporters , under the command of dafydd ap ieuan , against the yorkist edward iv the castle became a base for their operations across the region : there were planned operations in 1464 , sir richard tunstall mounted attacks from harlech in 1466 and jasper tudor landed there with french reinforcements in 1468 , before then raiding the town of denbigh harlech castle rests upon part of the rhinogydd , a spur of rock almost high ; the land falls away sharply on the north and west , and a ditch cut into the rock protects the remaining approaches to the castle the main entrance to the castle would have involved crossing a stone bridge between the two easterly ditch bridge towers and the main gatehouse ; little remains of the bridge towers today and a timber entrance way to the gatehouse replaces the bridge in the 13th century , the sea came up close to the stairway , allowing resupply by sea , but today the sea has retreated significantly , making it more difficult to envisage the concept in its original setting the use of these rooms has been the subject of academic debate : historian arnold taylor argued that the first floor of the gatehouse was used by the constable as living accommodation , with the second floor used by senior visitors ; jeremy ashbee has since challenged this interpretation , suggesting the high status accommodation may instead have been in the inner ward , and the gatehouse used for other purposes over time these acquired various names : in 1343 , clockwise from the north-east , they were called le prisontour , turris ultra gardinium , le wedercoktour and le chapeltour , but by 1564 they had been renamed the debtors ' , mortimer , bronwen and armourer 's towers respectively
