corey ( the surname was anglicized from the lebanon arabic khoury , meaning priest ) was born to lebanese greek orthodox christian immigrants in methuen , massachusetts , north of boston his widowed mother , brother , two sisters and an aunt and uncle all lived together in a spacious house , struggling through the great depression upon entering mit , corey 's only experience with science was in mathematics , and he began his college career pursuing a degree in engineering after his graduate career he was offered an appointment at the university of illinois at urbana–champaign , where he became a full professor of chemistry in 1956 at the age of 27 he was initiated as a member of the zeta chapter of alpha chi sigma at the university of illinois in 1952 fraternity – awards – hall of fame – alpha chi sigma in 1959 , he moved to harvard university , where he is currently an emeritus professor of organic chemistry with an active corey group research program he chose to work in organic chemistry because of '' its intrinsic beauty and its great relevance to human health '' among numerous honors , corey was awarded the national medal of science in 1988 , national science foundation – the president 's national medal of science the nobel prize in chemistry in 1990 , and the american chemical society 's greatest honor , the priestley medal , in 2004 corey has developed several new synthetic reagents : pyridinium chlorochromate , also referred to as the corey-suggs reagent , is widely used for the oxidation of alcohols to corresponding ketones and aldehydes the robustness of pcc as an oxidizing agent has also rendered it useful in the realm of total synthesis ( scheme 3 ) protecting groups ; georg thieme verlag : germany , 2000 in the field of complex molecule synthesis , tbs has been widely used as one of the most versatile of the silicon-based protecting groups ( scheme 4 ) the formation of dithiane was the initial development that introduced umpolung chemistry and is widely used for inversion of reactivity the utility of such reactions has expanded the field of organic synthesis by allowing synthetic chemists to use umpolung disconnections in total synthesis ( scheme 8 ) corey established the details of the remarkable cyclization process by first studying the biological synthesis of sterols from squalene see the methods tab several reactions have been named after him : corey-itsuno reduction , also known as the corey-bakshi-shibata reduction , is an enantioselective reduction of ketones to alcohols utilizing an oxazaborolidine catalyst and various boranes as the stoichiometric reductant the reaction uses the chiral amino acid proline and in the presence of borane leads to the cbs catalyst ( scheme 9 ) 1972 , 3769 the mechanism is similar to that of the wittig reaction by the formation of a phosphorus ylide with triphenylphosphine and carbon tetrabromide this synthetic transformation has been proven successful in the total synthesis ( + ) -taylorione by w.j in the total synthesis of ingenol , kuwajima and co-workers exploited the corey-kim oxidation by selectively oxidizing the less hindered secondary alcohol ( scheme 15 ) the formation of sterically hindered trans alkenes present in 7-membered rings was attempted by corey and coworkers , but was unsuccessful even when employing this new synthetic methodology incurring enormous ring strain the diels-alder reaction is one of the most powerful transformations in synthetic chemistry the synthesis of natural products using the diels-alder reaction as a transform has been applied especially to the formation of six-membered rings ( scheme 18 ) one of the first examples of this protocol was applied to the total synthesis of zearalenone ( scheme 20 ) the reaction forms a sulfur ylide in situ that reacts with enones , ketones , aldehydes , and imines to form corresponding epoxides , cyclopropanes , and aziridines sorensen , classics in total synthesis , vch , new york , 1996 , one of the examples that exemplified this protocol was an intermediate in the prostaglandin synthesis revealing a 9:1 mixture of the desired diastereomer ( scheme 24 ) see publications in in 2002 , the american chemical society ( acs ) recognized him as the '' most cited author in chemistry '' in 2007 , he received the first acs publications division '' cycle of excellence high impact contributor award '' and was ranked the number one chemist in terms of research impact by the hirsch index ( h-index ) corey and lászló kürti , enantioselective chemical synthesis : methods , logic , and practice , direct book publishing llc , 2010 , elias james corey , xue-min cheng while altom was the second suicide in as many years in corey 's lab , corey was devastated and bewildered by his student 's death '' the american foundation for suicide prevention ( afsp ) cited the new york times article on altom 's suicide as an example of problematic reporting , arguing that altom presented warning signs of depression and suicidal ideation and that the article had scapegoated corey despite a lack of secondary evidence that the advisor 's behavior had contributed to altom 's distress the afsp incorrectly identifies the author and date of the new york times article as keith b woodward a simple explanation involving the symmetry of the perturbed ( homo ) molecular orbitals for the stereoselective cyclobutene → 1,3-butadiene and 1,3,5-hexatriene → cyclohexadiene conversions that provided the basis for the further development of these ideas into what became known as the woodward–hoffmann rules corey , impossible dreams tab this was corey 's first public statement on his claim that starting on may 5 , 1964 woodward put forth corey 's explanation as his own thought with no mention of corey and the conversation of may 4 in the rebuttal , hoffmann states that he asked corey over the course of their long discussion of the matter why corey did not make the issue public '' corey also hoped that woodward himself would correct the historical record '' as he grew older , more considerate , and more sensitive to his own conscience corey has received more than 40 major awards including the linus pauling award ( 1973 ) , franklin medal ( 1978 ) , tetrahedron prize ( 1983 ) , wolf prize in chemistry ( 1986 ) , national medal of science ( 1988 ) , japan prize ( 1989 ) , nobel prize in chemistry ( 1990 ) , golden plate award of the academy of achievement ( 1991 ) , roger adams award ( 1993 ) , and the priestley medal ( 2004 ) as of 2008 , he has been awarded 19 honorary degrees from universities around the world including oxford university ( uk ) , cambridge university ( uk ) , and national chung cheng university corey
