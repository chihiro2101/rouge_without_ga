it was also an inspirational starting point for erwin schrödinger thinking , a course of lectures in 1943 , and the eventual writing of the book what is life ? the physical aspect of the living cell in 1937 , he attained a fellowship from rockefeller foundation—which was launching the molecular biology research program—to research genetics of the fruit fly , drosophila melanogaster , in california institute of technology 's biology department , '' mdc celebrates centennial of max delbrück '' in 1939 , with emory ellis , he coauthored '' the growth of bacteriophage '' , a paper reporting that the viruses reproduce in one step , not exponentially as do cellular organisms although delbrück 's rockefeller foundation fellowship expired in 1939 , the foundation matched him up with vanderbilt university in nashville , tennessee , where from 1940 to 1947 he taught physics , yet had his laboratory in the biology department '' max delbrück at vanderbilt , 1940–1947 '' , vanderbilt university , web access november 6 , 2013 in the feud between lamarck and darwin , darwin talked of pre-existing changes , but the nature of these changes was not known and had to await the science of genetics by gregor mendel 's experiments on pea plants published in 1866 this experiment dealt a blow to lamarckian inheritance and set the stage for tremendous advances in genetics and molecular biology , launching a tsunami of research that eventually led to the discovery of dna as the hereditary material and to cracking the genetic code of course , by then avery , along with mccloud ( and earlier , mccarty ) was well on the way to showing the genetic capability of dna in 1945 , delbrück , luria , and hershey set up a course in bacteriophage genetics at cold spring harbor laboratory in long island , new york delbrück received the 1969 nobel prize in physiology or medicine , shared with luria and hershey '' for their discoveries concerning the replication mechanism and the genetic struct ure of viruses '' in late 1947 , as vanderbilt lacked the resources to keep him , delbrück had returned to caltech as a professor of biology , and remained there for the rest of his career in addition to the nobel prize , delbrück was elected a list of fellows of the royal society elected in 1967 the max delbruck prize , formerly known as the biological physics prize , is awarded by the american physical society and named in his honour the max delbrück center , in berlin , germany , national research center for molecular medicine of the helmholtz association also bears his name his inferences on genes ' susceptibility to mutation was relied on by physicist erwin schrödinger in his 1944 book what is life ? , which conjectured genes were an '' aperiodic crystal '' storing codescript and influenced francis crick and james d max delbrück died , at age 74 , on the evening of monday , march 9 , 1981 , at huntington memorial hospital in pasadena , california
