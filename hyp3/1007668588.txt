the aire and calder is a canalisation of the river calder from wakefield to castleford , where it joins the branch from leeds , which follows the river aire the aire continues to flow eastwards to bank dole junction , then continues in a north-easterly direction to haddlesey , from where it follows a winding course to join the river ouse at airmyn from just before newbridge , where the modern a614 road crosses the waterway , this branch of the navigation runs parallel to the dutch river , an artificial channel built in 1635 to alleviate flooding caused by cornelius vermuyden 's original diversion of the river don northwards to the river aire in 1628 the aire and calder still fulfils its original purpose of linking leeds and wakefield with york and the humber ( and thence the trent ) , although the routes by which this is achieved have changed significantly the calder and hebble navigation , which connects to the navigation at wakefield , allows boats to reach the huddersfield broad and narrow canals , and the rochdale canal the sheffield and south yorkshire navigation , which can be reached via the new junction canal , forms a link with doncaster , rotherham and sheffield to the south west , and the tidal river trent at keadby to the east in the early 1600s , the river aire was navigable to knottingley , and boats carrying up to 30 & nbsp ; tons traded on the river , which was tidal up to this point it named 18 undertakers , nine from the corporation of leeds , and nine '' gentlemen of wakefield '' , who would oversee the improvements to the river aire ( from the river ouse at airmyn via castleford to leeds ) and the river calder ( from castleford to wakefield ) john hadley was engaged as the engineer immediately , and by 1704 the original work was completed , including 12 locks on the aire between haddesley and leeds and 4 on the calder the recently finished calder and hebble navigation proposed to build a canal from wakefield to the dutch river , which would bypass the calder completely , and the leeds and liverpool canal supported a leeds to selby canal , which would bypass the aire with parliament not reaching a decision , they reworked their plan , which was now for a canal from haddlesey to selby , with a new cut from ferrybridge to beal , and improvements above castleford in 1817 , there was a proposal for an aire and don canal , to connect knottingley to the dutch river at newbridge , with a branch to doncaster , and another for a went and wakefield canal , to connect cold hiendley on the barnsley canal to newbridge on the don with revenue from tolls reaching £82,092 in 1818 , which enabled a dividend of £54,000 to be paid , the company was in a healthy state , and proposed their own route from haddlesey to the dutch river in july 1821 , rennie proposed the construction of docks at goole , rather than a lock into the river , and the company proposed that of water should be available the leeds line was completed in april 1835 , somewhat later than anticipated , as the banks were made more substantial , to cope with steam tugs , which would be introduced in due course improvements to the calder to wakefield took longer , as there were problems with floods filling the workings , difficulty with constructing foundations for an aqueduct which would carry the navigation over the river calder at stanley ferry , and then in transporting the castings for the aqueduct to the site warde-aldam thought that such a system could carry 45,000 tons of coal per year , and £13,382 was allocated for three train boats , a hoist , and hydraulic machinery to control the hoist and the lock into the docks '' the length of the trains increased to ten or eleven tubs , but such a train was difficult to steer from the rear , and so the tugs moved to the front and pulled the assembly after the first world war , another programme of improvements to the locks was carried out , extending the locks to , which enabled trains of 19 compartments to operate regularly the compartments continued until the late 1960s to carry around half a million tons of coal , long after most british canals had ceased to be used for commercial traffic , but the gradual demise of the coal industry led to compartment traffic ceasing in 1986 locks on the wakefield section can accommodate vessels which are with a draught of , though rigid vessels are constrained to 141 & nbsp ; ft to enable turning at wakefield while the locks below castleford have three sets of gates , so that a section can be used , rather than the full required by the compartment boats the complete structure was then pushed into position by hydraulic jacks in a six-day operation , after which the navigation was diverted over it , although the old aqueduct was left in place and can still be used the failure resulted in some of material , including the banks of the river and the canal , slipping into the workings , which then flooded to a depth of , creating a lake which covered called bacat , for barges aboard catamaran , the system consisted of trains of barges , which were pushed by a tug , and which would be loaded between the twin hulls of a custom-built delivery ship the aire and calder was built for commercial freight , and although the volume carried has dropped significantly , particularly since coal deliveries to ferrybridge power station by canal stopped , the navigation still carried 300,000 tonnes of freight in 2007 , down from 1.64 million tonnes in 2000 the leeds to castleford section and much of the wakefield branch are now mainly used as leisure routes , but below castleford , the industrial nature of the waterway is more obvious , and pleasure boats must give way to commercial vessels with the possible restoration of the barnsley canal and the dearne and dove canal , the section between wakefield and the new junction canal might become part of a new '' yorkshire ring ''
