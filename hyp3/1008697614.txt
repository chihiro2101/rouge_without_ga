due to the radical differences between the p6 and netburst microarchitectures , intel could not market willamette as a pentium iii , so it was marketed as the pentium 4 according to these experts , the pentium 4 was released because the competing thunderbird-based amd athlon was outperforming the aging pentium iii , and further improvements to the pentium iii were not yet possible this pentium 4 was produced using a 180 & nbsp ; nm process and initially used socket 423 ( also called socket w , for '' willamette '' ) , with later revisions moving to socket 478 ( socket n , for '' northwood '' ) on the test bench , the willamette was somewhat disappointing to analysts in that not only was it unable to outperform the athlon and the highest-clocked pentium iiis in all testing situations , but it was not superior to the budget segment 's amd duron although introduced at prices of 644 ( 1.4 & nbsp ; ghz ) and 819 ( 1.5 & nbsp ; ghz ) for 1000 quantities to oem pc manufacturers ( prices for models for the consumer market varied by retailer ) , it sold at a modest but respectable rate , handicapped somewhat by the requirement for relatively fast yet expensive rambus dynamic ram ( rdram ) a 2.4 & nbsp ; ghz pentium 4 was released on april 2 , 2002 , and the bus speed increased from 400 & nbsp ; mt/s to 533 & nbsp ; mt/s ( 133 & nbsp ; mhz physical clock ) for the 2.26 & nbsp ; ghz , 2.4 & nbsp ; ghz , and 2.53 & nbsp ; ghz models in may , 2.66 & nbsp ; ghz and 2.8 & nbsp ; ghz models in august , and 3.06 & nbsp ; ghz model in november by shuffling two ( ideally differing ) program instructions to simultaneously execute through a single physical processor core , the goal is to best utilize processor resources that would have otherwise been unused from the traditional approach of having these single instructions wait for each other to execute singularly through the core as agp was the primary graphics expansion port for desktop use , this oversight prevented the opteron from encroaching from the server market and threatening the pentium 4 desktop market meanwhile , with the launch of the athlon xp 3200+ in amd 's desktop line , amd increased the athlon xp 's fsb speed from 333 & nbsp ; mt/s to 400 & nbsp ; mt/s , but it was not enough to hold off the new 3 & nbsp ; ghz pentium 4 ht there was the pentium iii mobile chip , the mobile pentium 4-m , the mobile pentium 4 , and then just the pentium m which itself was based on the pentium iii and significantly faster than the former three unlike the desktop pentium 4 , the pentium 4-m did not feature an integrated heat spreader ( ihs ) , and it operates at a lower voltage oddly , increasing the bus speed by 133 & nbsp ; mt/s ( 33 & nbsp ; mhz ) caused a massive increase in tdps , as mobile pentium 4 processors emitted 59.8–70 w of heat , with the hyper-threading variants emitting 66.1–88 w this allowed the mobile pentium 4 to bridge the gap between the desktop pentium 4 ( up to 115 w tdp ) , and the pentium 4-m ( up to 35 w tdp ) in september 2003 , at the intel developer forum , the pentium 4 extreme edition ( p4ee ) was announced , just over a week before the launch of athlon 64 and athlon 64 fx the design was mostly identical to pentium 4 ( to the extent that it would run in the same motherboards ) , but differed by an added 2 & nbsp ; mb of level 3 cache it shared the same gallatin core as the xeon mp , though in a socket 478 form factor ( as opposed to socket 603 for the xeon mp ) and with an 800 & nbsp ; mt/s bus , twice as fast as that of the xeon mp multimedia encoding and certain games benefited the most , with the extreme edition outperforming the pentium 4 , and even the two athlon 64 variants , although the lower price and more balanced performance of the athlon 64 ( particularly the non-fx version ) led to it usually being seen as the better value proposition in january 2004 a 3.4 & nbsp ; ghz version was released for socket 478 , and in summer 2004 the cpu was released using the new socket 775 by most metrics , this was on a per-clock basis the fastest single-core netburst processor that was ever produced , even outperforming many of its successor chips ( not counting the dual-core pentium d ) in practice however , the 3.73 & nbsp ; ghz pentium 4 extreme edition almost always proved to be slower than the 3.46 & nbsp ; ghz pentium 4 extreme edition , which is most likely due to the lack of an l3 cache and the longer instruction pipeline although never a particularly good seller , especially since it was released in a time when amd was asserting near total dominance in the processor performance race , the pentium 4 extreme edition established a new position within intel 's product line , that of an enthusiast oriented chip with the highest-end specifications offered by intel chips , along with unlocked multipliers to allow for easier overclocking in this role it has since been succeeded by the pentium extreme edition ( the extreme version of the dual-core pentium d ) , the core 2 extreme , the core i7 and most recently , the core i9 in fact , prescott 's power and heat characteristics were only slightly higher than those of northwood of the same speed and nearly equal to the gallatin-based extreme editions , but since those processors had already been operating near the limits of what was considered thermally acceptable , this still posed a major issue lga 775 prescott uses a rating system , labeling them as the 5xx series ( celeron ds are the 3xx series , while pentium ms are the 7xx series ) the lga 775 version of the e-series uses model numbers 5x0 ( 520–560 ) , and the lga 775 version of the a-series uses model numbers 5x5 and 5x9 ( 505–519 ) it features intel 64 , the xd & nbsp ; bit , eist ( enhanced intel speedstep technology ) , tm2 ( for processors at 3.6 & nbsp ; ghz and above ) , and 2 & nbsp ; mb of l2 cache the original successor to the pentium 4 was ( codenamed ) tejas , which was scheduled for an early-mid-2005 release however , it was cancelled a few months after the release of prescott due to extremely high tdps ( a 2.8 & nbsp ; ghz tejas emitted 150 w of heat , compared to around 80 w for a northwood of the same speed , and 100 w for a comparably clocked prescott ) and development on the netburst microarchitecture as a whole ceased , with the exception of the dual-core pentium d and pentium extreme edition and the cedar mill-based pentium 4 ht the actual successor to the pentium 4 brand is the intel core 2 brand , released on july 27 , 2006 the underlying microarchitecture is the core microarchitecture , and the first chips implementing it ( in 65 & nbsp ; nm ) are called '' conroe ''
