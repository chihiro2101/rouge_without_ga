the word 'photonics ' is derived from the greek word '' phos '' meaning light ( which has genitive case '' photos '' and in compound words the root '' photo- '' is used ) ; it appeared in the late 1960s to describe a research field whose goal was to use light to perform functions that traditionally fell within the typical domain of electronics , such as telecommunications , information processing , etc other developments followed : the laser diode in the 1970s , optical fibers for transmitting information , and the optical amplifier however , photonics covers a huge range of science and technology applications , including laser manufacturing , biological and chemical sensing , medical diagnostics and therapy , display technology , and optical computing optics tools include the refracting lens , the reflecting mirror , and various optical components and instruments developed throughout the 15th to 19th centuries key tenets of classical optics , such as huygens principle , developed in the 17th century , maxwell 's equations and the wave equations , developed in the 19th , do not depend on quantum properties of light the term photonics more specifically connotes : the particle properties of light , the potential of creating signal processing device technologies using photons , the practical application of optics , and an analogy to electronics optomechanics , which involves the study of the interaction between light and mechanical vibrations of mesoscopic or macroscopic objects ; opto-atomics , in which devices integrate both photonic and atomic devices for applications such as precision timekeeping , navigation , and metrology ; plasmonics , which studies the interaction between light and plasmons in dielectric and metallic structures jpg thumb a sea mouse ( aphrodita aculeata ) , showing colorful spines , a remarkable example of photonic engineering by a living organism applications of photonics are ubiquitous light detection , telecommunications , information processing , photonic computing , lighting , metrology , spectroscopy , holography , medicine ( surgery , vision correction , endoscopy , health monitoring ) , biophotonics , military technology , laser material processing , art diagnostics ( involving infrared reflectography , x-ray , ultraviolet fluorescence , xrf ) , agriculture , and robotics just as applications of electronics have expanded dramatically since the first transistor was invented in 1948 , the unique applications of photonics continue to emerge economically important applications for semiconductor photonic devices include optical data recording , fiber optic telecommunications , laser printing ( based on xerography ) , displays , and optical pumping of high-power lasers the potential applications of photonics are virtually unlimited and include chemical synthesis , medical diagnostics , on-chip data communication , sensors , laser defense , and fusion energy , to name several interesting additional examples consumer equipment : barcode scanner , printer , cd/dvd/blu-ray devices , remote control devices telecommunications : optical fiber communications , optical down converter to microwave medicine : correction of poor eyesight , laser surgery , surgical endoscopy , tattoo removal industrial manufacturing : the use of lasers for welding , drilling , cutting , and various methods of surface modification construction : laser leveling , laser rangefinding , smart structures aviation : photonic gyroscopes lacking mobile parts military : ir sensors , command and control , navigation , search and rescue , mine laying and detection entertainment : laser shows , beam effects , holographic art information processing sensors : lidar , sensors for consumer electronics metrology : time and frequency measurements , rangefinder photonic computing : clock distribution and communication between computers , printed circuit boards , or within optoelectronic integrated circuits ; in the future : quantum computer microphotonics and nanophotonics usually includes photonic crystals and solid state devices the science of photonics includes investigation of the emission , transmission , amplifier , detection , and modulation of light photonics commonly uses semiconductor-based light sources , such as light-emitting diodes ( leds ) , superluminescent diodes , and lasers analog rf signal applications : using the ghz precision signal processing of photonic integrated circuits , radiofrequency ( rf ) signals can be manipulated with high fidelity to add or drop multiple channels of radio , spread across an ultra-broadband frequency range lidar and other phased array imaging : arrays of pics can take advantage of phase delays in the light reflected from objects with three-dimensional shapes to reconstruct 3d images , and light imaging , detection and ranging ( lidar ) with laser light can offer a complement to radar by providing precision imaging ( with 3d information ) at close distances the main advantages of this approach are speed of analysis , non-invasive diagnostics , and the ability to work in situ
