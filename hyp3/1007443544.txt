the concept of a regulatory '' race to the bottom '' emerged in the united states during the late 1800s and early 1900s , when there was charter competition among states to attract corporations to base in their jurisdiction in 2003 , in response to reports that british supermarkets had cut the price of bananas , and by implication had squeezed revenues of banana-growing developing nations , alistair smith , international co-coordinator of banana link , said '' the british supermarkets are leading a race to the bottom he argues that the thesis incorrectly assumes that states exclusively responds to the preferences of capital ( and not to other constituents , such as voters ) , state regulations are sufficiently costly for producers that they would be willing to re-locate elsewhere , and no state has an economy large enough to give it a bargaining power advantage over global capital other countries allow private developers from foreign firms or foreign nations , such as china to submit the environmental impact assessment , which has the potential to omit certain environmental concerns in order to receive project approval and casts doubt on the legitimacy of the environmental impact assessment process 91 brandeis 's '' race to the bottom '' metaphor was updated in 1974 by william cary , in an article in the yale law journal , '' federalism and corporate law : reflections upon delaware , '' in which cary argued for the imposition of national standards for corporate governance there is a debate about if a race to the bottom is actually bad or even possible , and if corporations or nation states should play a bigger role in the regulatory process '' another example is the cruise ship , with corporations headquartered in wealthy developed nations but which registers its ships in countries with minimal environmental or labor laws , and no corporate taxes it is expensive to treat chemical waste , so corporations wanting to keep production costs low , may move to countries which do not require them to treat their waste before dumping it environmental impact assessments are not the only form of government regulation and dams in south america are just one example of a global trend in deregulation by states in order to bring in more foreign direct investment conversely , some states have begun to pursue a race to the top strategy , which stresses innovative environmental policies at the state level , with the hopes that these policies will later be adopted by other states
