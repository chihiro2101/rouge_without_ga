some critics say that rio reiser created a new image of a german folk singer ; he was even called a '' schlager '' artist , and a '' volksmusik '' musician ( sometimes translated as '' folk music '' , but in a literary sense it means music of the people ) ton steine scherben were musically very successful and , being one of the first rock bands in germany which actually wrote and performed german rock songs , opened the door for countless successful german rock and pop bands to follow besides contemporary rock bands which became the soundtrack of the social changes beginning in the sixties , rio reiser was also influenced by other music styles including orchestral film soundtracks , german '' folk songs '' and traditional music and german singers such as marlene dietrich after occasionally having toured the countryside with the theatre group '' hoffmans comic theater '' ( consisting in reiser , his brothers and a group of friends ) , reiser went on to continue theatrical projects in berlin where he joined an improvisation theatre group which played scenes from the everyday life of pupils and trainees , thus adopting and reflecting the social problems among young people in west berlin in the sixties , as well as its tense and sense of imminent social change at the beginning of his career , reiser sometimes felt misfit among the political groups and various movements which , in the early seventies , did not strongly approve of homosexuality , but later gained more confidence while working with artists who were engaged in the newly forming gay movement of berlin , including the gay performance group '' brühwarm '' which recorded two lps with music composed by ton steine scherben in 1975—after the band was tiring of the numerous demands and expectations by all kinds of political groups—the group settled down on a farm in stadum , in north germany which continued to be reiser 's refuge and place of inspiration even after moving back to berlin a couple of years later wandering on the edge of commercial adaptability , while trying to conform with the expectations of old friends , fans and political movements which he supported meant a difficult struggle for reiser which sometimes drove him to despair and depression lanrue ( real name ralph peter steitz ) , a boy living in the neighbourhood , who had heard of reiser 's singing talents and had asked him to join the band after letting reiser perform a few songs to give a sample ( as r.p.s recordings of the concerts prove that the east german audience knew the lyrics of his solo songs , and in particular all of the '' ton steine scherben '' songs which they performed by heart , even though the albums were hard to come by in the gdr many of his fans from the ton steine scherben-days thought that he was selling out to mainstream , capitalist music business , and blamed him for becoming—at least for a period of time—a commercially successful musician the band name was chosen in a lengthy democratic decision procedure among the members , friends and supporters of the band he kept the nickname and later decided to completely change his name from ralph möbius to rio reiser because he played a leading role in the movie '' johnny west '' and needed a catchy artist name thus , many buildings were seized after the end of a concert , and the band often ended up sitting in some commune discussing the political agenda with their hosts lanrue , who was of the same age as reiser , soon became reiser 's closest friend and musical counterpart who went on to support reiser as musician and lived with him most of the time until his death
