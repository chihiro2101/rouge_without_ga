this status difference was marked at the beginning of the republic : patricians were better represented in the roman assemblies , only patricians could hold high political offices , such as dictator , consul , and censor , and all priesthoods ( such as pontifex maximus ) were closed to non-patricians the last-known instance of a gens being admitted to the patriciate prior to the 1st century bc was when the claudii were added to the ranks of the patricians after coming to rome in 504 bc , five years after the establishment of the republic a series of laws diminished the distinction between the two classes , including lex canuleia ( 445 bc ; which allowed the marriage—ius connubii—between patricians and plebeian ) , lex licinia sextia ( 367 bc ; which made restrictions on possession of public lands—ager publicus—and also made sure that one of the consuls was plebeian ) , lex ogulnia ( 300 bc ; plebeians received access to priest posts ) , and lex hortensia ( 287 bc ; verdicts of plebeian assemblies—plebiscita—now bind all people ) zosimus , historia nova , ii.40.2 in the late western roman empire , the title was sparingly used and retained its high prestige , being awarded , especially in the 5th century , to the powerful who dominated the state , such as stilicho , constantius iii , flavius aetius , comes bonifacius , and ricimer two laws passed during the fourth century bc began the gradual opening of magistrates to the plebeians : the lex licinia sextia of 367 bc , which established the right of plebeians to hold the consulship ; and the genucian law of 342 bc , which required that at least one of the consuls be a plebeian ( although this law was frequently violated for several decades ) however , harper 's dictionary of classical antiquities suggests that the alban families were also included among the gentes maiores , and that the gentes minores consisted of the families admitted to the patriciate under the tarquins and in the early years of the republic the distinction between the noble class , the patricians , and the roman populace , the plebeians , existed from the beginning of ancient rome harper 's dictionary of classical antiquities , second edition , harry thurston peck , editor ( 1897 ) livy , ab urbe condita , book ii livy , ab urbe condita , book i the criteria for why romulus chose certain men for this class remains contested by academics and historians , but the importance of the patrician/ plebeian distinction is accounted by all as paramount to ancient roman society ancient rome , according to ralph mathisen , author of ancient roman civilization : history and sources , made political reforms , such as the introduction of the council of the plebs and the tribunes of the plebs the patrician title was occasionally used in western europe after the end of the roman empire ; for instance , pope stephen ii granted the title '' patricius of the romans '' to the frankish ruler pepin the short the title of , '' first patrician '' ) is also evidenced in the east from 367 to 711 , possibly referring to the senior-most holder of the office and leader of the patrician order after the conflict of the orders , according to mathisen , plebeians were able to rise in politics and become members of the senate , which used to be exclusively for patricians since the patricians were of high social status , they did not want to lose this status ; they were not in agreement with changing the structure of society by giving plebeians more status the decline accelerated toward the end of the republic , principally because of the civil wars , from the social war to the proscriptions of the triumvirs , which took a heavy toll on them by the end of the republic , only priesthoods with limited political importance , such as the salii , the flamen , and the rex sacrorum , were filled exclusively by patricians as a result , several illustrious patrician houses were on the verge of extinction during the 1st century bc , sometimes only surviving through adoptions , such as : julii caesares manlii torquatii papirii masones postumii albini servilii caepiones however , large gentes with multiple seem to have coped better ; the aemilii , claudii , cornelii , fabii , sulpicii , and valerii all continued to thrive under the principate according to livy , the first 100 men appointed as senators by romulus were referred to as '' fathers '' ( latin patres ) , and the descendants of those men became the patrician class for more on ancient rome 's social class distinction visit social class in ancient rome very few plebeian names appear in lists of roman magistrates during the early republic many of the ancient patrician gentes whose members appear in the founding legends of rome disappeared as rome acquired its empire , and new plebeian families rose to prominence the patricians were given noble status when named to the senate , giving them wider political influence than the plebs , at least in the times of the early republic '' patrician '' and '' plebeian '' are still used today to refer to groups of people of high and lower classes 28 the feminine variant denoted the spouses of ; it is not to be confused with the title of ( '' girded '' ) , which was a unique dignity conferred on the ladies-in-waiting of the empress cassius states , '' for the shoes worn by the patricians in the city were ornamented with laced straps and the design of the letter , to signify that they were descended from the original hundred men that had been senators patrician status still carried a degree of prestige at the time of the early roman empire , and roman emperors routinely elevated their supporters to the patrician caste en masse although modern writers often portray patricians as rich and powerful families who managed to secure power over the less-fortunate plebeian families , plebeians and patricians among the senatorial class were equally wealthy this prestige gradually declined further , and by the end of the 3rd-century crisis patrician status , as it had been known in the republic , ceased to have meaning in everyday life 56 other noble families which came to rome during the time of the kings were also admitted to the patriciate , including several who emigrated from alba longa , after that city was destroyed by tullus hostilius as civil rights for plebeians increased during the middle and late roman republic , many plebeian families had attained wealth and power while some traditionally patrician families had fallen into poverty and obscurity
