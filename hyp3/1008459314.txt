for any fixed set of genetic and environmental conditions , recombination in a particular region of a linkage structure ( chromosome ) tends to be constant , and the same is then true for the crossing-over value which is used in the production of genetic maps recombination appears to be a major driving force in determining genetic variability within coronaviruses , as well as the ability of coronavirus species to jump from one host to another and , infrequently , for the emergence of novel species , although the mechanism of recombination in is unclear ; bacterial recombination in bacteria there are : regular bacterial recombination , as well as noneffective transfer of genetic material , expressed as unsuccessful transfer or abortive transfer which is any bacterium dna transfer of the donor cell recipients who have set the incoming dna as part of the genetic material of the recipient the co type of recombination involves the intermediate formation of two “ holliday junctions ” indicated in the lower right of the figure by two x shaped structures in each of which there is an exchange of single strands between the two participating chromatids in gene conversion , a section of genetic material is copied from one chromosome to another , without the donating chromosome being changed recombination , in this version of the model , is initiated by a double-strand break ( or gap ) shown in the dna molecule ( chromatid ) at the top of the first figure in this article switching between template strands during genome replication , referred to as copy-choice recombination , was originally proposed to explain the positive correlation of recombination events over short distances in organisms with a dna genome ( see first figure , sdsa pathway ) indicated on the right side is a “ crossover ” ( co ) type , where the flanking regions of the chromosomes are exchanged , and on the left side , a “ non-crossover ” ( nco ) type where the flanking regions are not exchanged in the case of pathogenic viruses , multiplicity reactivation may be an adaptive benefit to the virus since it allows the repair of dna damages caused by exposure to the oxidizing environment produced during host infection it is a process by which a dna sequence is copied from one dna helix ( which remains unchanged ) to another dna helix , whose sequence is altered a major incentive for developing a fundamental understanding of the mechanism of meiotic recombination is that such understanding is crucial for solving the problem of the adaptive function of sex , a major unresolved issue in biology in humans , deficiencies in the gene products necessary for hrr during meiosis likely cause infertility in humans , deficiencies in gene products necessary for hrr , such as brca1 and brca2 , increase the risk of cancer ( see dna repair-deficiency disorder ) in genetic engineering , recombination can also refer to artificial and deliberate recombination of disparate pieces of dna , often from different organisms , creating what is called recombinant dna a prime example of such a use of genetic recombination is gene targeting , which can be used to add , delete or otherwise change an organism 's genes the rad51 protein is required for mitosis and meiosis recombination , whereas the dna repair protein , dmc1 , is specific to meiotic recombination transformation may provide a benefit to pathogenic bacteria by allowing repair of dna damage , particularly damages that occur in the inflammatory , oxidizing environment associated with infection of a host another recombination model counters this idea , and instead proposes that recombination occurs sporadically when the two domains of reverse transcriptase , the rnase h and the polymerase , differ in their activity speeds in bacteria , transformation is a process of gene transfer that ordinarily occurs between individual cells of the same bacterial species while in this formation , homologous sites on two chromatids can closely pair with one another , and may exchange genetic information the figure shows that two of the four chromatids present early in meiosis ( prophase i ) are paired with each other and able to interact
