'' hagigah 15a the rabbis explain that metatron had permission to sit because of his function as the heavenly scribe , writing down the deeds of israel the talmud states , it was proved to elisha that metatron could not be a second deity by the fact that metatron received 60 '' pulsa dinura '' to demonstrate that metatron was not a god , but an angel , and could be punished extra-talmudic mystical texts such as sefer hekhalot do speak of a '' lesser yhwh '' , apparently deriving the concept from exodus 23:21 , which mentions an angel of whom god says '' my name understood as yhvh , the usual divine proper name is in him '' metatron also appears in the pseudepigrapha including shi'ur qomah , and most prominently in the hebrew merkabah book of enoch , also called 3 enoch or sefer hekhalot ( book of the heavenly palaces ) the book describes the link between enoch , son of jared ( great grandfather of noah ) and his transformation into the angel metatron called me , 'the lesser yhvh ' in the presence of his whole household in the height , as it is written , 'my name is in him 3 enoch presents metatron in two ways : as a primordial angel ( 9:2–13:2 ) and as the transformation of enoch after he was assumed into heaven zohar commentaries such as the '' ohr yakar '' by moses ben jacob cordovero explain the zohar as meaning that metaron as the head of yetzira this corresponds closely with maimonides ' description of the talmudic '' prince of the world '' , traditionally associated with metatron , as the core '' active intellect the zohar finds the word '' youth '' used to describe joseph and joshua a hint that the figures are a metaphor to metatron , and also the concept of '' servant '' by eliezer as a reference to metatron wasserstrom between muslim and jew : the problem of symbiosis under early islam princeton university press 2014 p wasserstrom between muslim and jew : the problem of symbiosis under early islam princeton university press 2014 p wasserstrom between muslim and jew : the problem of symbiosis under early islam princeton university press 2014 p 193 he is also frequently mentioned in the magical works by ahmad al-buni , who describes metatron as wearing a crown and a lance , probably constituting the staff of moses wasserstrom between muslim and jew : the problem of symbiosis under early islam princeton university press 2014 p wasserstrom between muslim and jew : the problem of symbiosis under early islam princeton university press 2014 p orlov , the enoch-metatron tradition ( tsaj , 107 ; tuebingen : mohr-siebeck , 2005 ) 92-97 however , some scholars , such as philip alexander , believe if the name metatron originated in hekhalot-merkabah texts ( such as 3 enoch ) , then it may be a magic word like adiriron and dapdapiron metatron seems to be made up of two greek words for after and throne , ( meta thronos ) , taken together as '' one who serves behind the throne '' or '' one who occupies the throne next to the throne of glory '' the word ( synthronos ) is used as '' co-occupant of the divine throne '' ; sunthronos , the greek term metaturannos , which can be translated as '' the one next to the ruler '' philip alexander also suggests this as a possible origin of metatron , stating that the word metator also occurs in greek as mitator–a word for an officer in the roman army who acted as a forerunner using this etymology , alexander suggests the name may have come about as a description of '' the angel of the lord who led the israelites through the wilderness : acting like a roman army metator guiding the israelites on their way '' oclc : 15489564 another possible interpretation is that of enoch as a metator showing them '' how they could escape from the wilderness of this world into the promised land of heaven '' in the entry entitled '' paradigmata '' in his study , '' 'the written ' as the vocation of conceiving jewishly '' , john w mcginley gives an accounting of how this name functions in the bavli 's version of '' four entered pardes '' the entry '' paradigmatia '' gives an accounting of the meaning of '' metatron '' as it is used in the bavli 's version of '' four entered pardes '' this hypothesis explains why the generators of the '' chambers '' portion of the heikhalot literature make '' ishmael ben elisha '' the major protagonist of their writings even though this rabbi ishmael was not directly mentioned in the bavli 's account ( in the gemara to tractate khaggigah ) of '' the work of the chariot '' solomon judah loeb rapoport in igrot shir suggests that metatron is a combination of two greek words which mean to '' change '' and '' pass away '' referring to chanoch ( enoch ) who '' changed '' into an angel and '' passed away '' from the world '' curtis armstrong : metatron , marv '' metatron appears in the megami tensei video game series , including its spinoff , the persona series , as an angel and arbiter of judgement metatron appears as an angel and the spokesperson of god in the book good omens and the 2019 tv series by the same name , played in the series by derek jacobi metatron is the name of an artificially intelligent supercomputer in the 2019 conspiracy sci-fi thriller novel '' reality '' by dc wince , created by the mysterious powerful group the syndicate to help them dominate the world , and is the host of the reality game central to the book 's story
