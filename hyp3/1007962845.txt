( archive ) the preparation of sulfuric acid ( 'oil of vitriol ' ) by the distillation of green vitriol ( iron ( ii ) sulfate ) has been known for at least 700 years ferrous sulfate was used in the manufacture of inks , most notably iron gall ink , which was used from the middle ages until the end of the eighteenth century after printing an insoluble form of indigo onto the fabric , the indigo was reduced to leuco-indigo in a sequence of baths of ferrous sulfate ( with reoxidation to indigo in air between immersions ) iron ( ii ) sulfate can be found in various states of hydrate , and several of these forms exist in nature feso 4 ·h 2 o ( mineral : szomolnokite , relatively rare ) feso 4 ·4h 2 o ( mineral : rozenite , white , relatively common , may be dehydratation product of melanterite ) feso 4 ·5h 2 o ( mineral : siderotil , relatively rare ) feso 4 ·6h 2 o ( mineral : ferrohexahydrite , relatively rare ) feso 4 ·7h 2 o ( mineral : melanterite , blue-green , relatively common ) the tetrahydrate is stabilized when the temperature of aqueous solutions reaches numerous other , more complex ( either basic , hydrated , and/or containing additional cations ) fe ( ii ) -bearing sulfates exist in such environments , with copiapite being a good and common example ferrous sulfate is also prepared commercially by oxidation of pyrite : :2 & nbsp ; fes 2 + 7 & nbsp ; o 2 + 2 & nbsp ; h 2 o → 2 & nbsp ; feso 4 + 2 & nbsp ; h 2 so 4 it can be produced by displacement of metals less reactive than iron from solutions of their sulfate : cuso 4 + fe → feso 4 + cu upon dissolving in water , ferrous sulfates form the metal aquo complex fe ( h 2 o ) 6 2+ , which is an almost colorless , paramagnetic ion :2 & nbsp ; feso 4 → fe 2 o 3 + so 2 + so 3 like all iron ( ii ) salts , iron ( ii ) sulfate is a reducing agent for example , it reduces nitric acid to nitrogen monoxide and chlorine to chloride : :6 & nbsp ; feso 4 + 3 & nbsp ; h 2 so 4 + 2 & nbsp ; hno 3 → 3 & nbsp ; fe 2 ( so 4 ) 3 + 4 & nbsp ; h 2 o + 2 no :6 & nbsp ; feso 4 + 3 & nbsp ; cl 2 → 2 & nbsp ; fe 2 ( so 4 ) 3 + 2 & nbsp ; fecl 3 upon exposure to air , it oxidizes to form a corrosive brown-yellow coating of '' basic ferric sulfate '' , which is an adduct of iron ( iii ) oxide and iron ( iii ) sulfate : :12 & nbsp ; feso 4 + 3 & nbsp ; o 2 → 4 & nbsp ; fe 2 ( so 4 ) 3 + 2 & nbsp ; fe 2 o 3 this '' basic sulphate '' may then be decomposed by heating increasing the sulphur trioxide yield compared to direct decomposition of ferrous sulphate : 4 & nbsp ; fe 2 ( so 4 ) 3 + 2 & nbsp ; fe 2 o 3 → 12 & nbsp ; so 3 + 6 & nbsp ; fe 2 o 3 however , some of the sulphur trioxide may be lost to thermal decomposition : 2 & nbsp ; so 3 → 2 & nbsp ; so 2 + o 2 copper ( ii ) sulfate ammonium iron ( ii ) sulfate , also known as mohr 's salt , the common double salt of ammonium sulfate with iron ( ii ) sulfate
