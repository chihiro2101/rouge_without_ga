through years of postmortem examinations and anthropometric studies of criminals , the insane , and normal individuals , lombroso became convinced that the '' born criminal '' ( reo nato , a term given by ferri ) could be anatomically identified by such items as a sloping forehead , ears of unusual size , asymmetry of the face , prognathism , excessive length of arms , asymmetry of the cranium , and other '' physical stigmata '' lombroso 's work was also criticized by italian anthropologist giuseppe sergi who , in his review of lombroso 's the man of genius -- and specifically his classifications and definitions of '' the genius '' —stated '' by creating a genius according to his own fancy , an ideal and abstract being , and not by examining the personality of a real living genius , he naturally arrives at the conclusion that all theories by which the origin of genius is sought to be explained on a basis of observation , and especially that particular one which finds in degeneration the cause or one of the causes of genius , are erroneous '' however , lombroso 's '' obdurate beliefs '' about women presented an '' intractable problem '' for this theory : '' because he was convinced that women are inferior to men lombroso was unable to argue , based on his theory of the born criminal , that women 's lesser involvement in crime reflected their comparatively lower levels of atavism lombroso also maintained that criminals had less sensitivity to pain and touch ; more acute sight ; a lack of moral sense , including an absence of remorse ; more vanity , impulsiveness , vindictiveness , and cruelty ; and other manifestations , such as a special criminal argot and the excessive use of tattooing 1899 & nbsp ; crime : its causes and remedies 1909 & nbsp ; after death - what ? 1911 & nbsp ; criminal man , according to the classification of cesare lombroso 2004 & nbsp ; the criminal anthropological writings of cesare lombroso 2004 & nbsp ; criminal woman , the prostitute , and the normal woman besides the '' born criminal '' , lombroso also described '' criminaloids '' , or occasional criminals , criminals by passion , moral imbeciles , and criminal epileptics lombroso listed the following geniuses , among others , as '' sickly and weak during childhood '' ; demosthenes , francis bacon , descartes , isaac newton , john locke , adam smith , robert boyle , alexander pope , john flaxman , nelson , albrecht von haller , korner , and blaise pascal later in life lombroso came to be influenced by gina 's husband , guglielmo ferrero , who led him to believe that not all criminality comes from one 's inborn factors and that social factors also played a significant role in the process of shaping a criminal he continues by listing the only '' great men of tall stature '' that he knows of , including petrarch , friedrich schiller , foscolo , bismarck , charlemagne , dumas , george washington , peter the great , and voltaire in his exploration of geniuses descending into madness , lombroso stated that he could only find six men who did not exhibit symptoms of '' degeneration '' or madness ; galileo , da vinci , voltaire , machiavelli , michelangelo , and darwin lombroso 's the man of genius provided inspiration for max nordau 's work , as evidenced by his dedication of degeneration to lombroso , whom he considered to be his '' dear and honored master '' in his explanation of the connection between genius and the '' degenerative marker '' of height , lombroso cites the following people : robert and elizabeth browning , henrik ibsen , george eliot , thiers , robert browning , louis blanc , and algernon charles swinburne among others the anthropologist edward clodd wrote '' lombroso swallowed the lot at a gulp , from table raps to materialisation of the departed , spirit photographs and spirit voices ; every story , old or new , alike from savage and civilised sources , confirming his will to believe '' sergi continued by stating that such theorists are '' like the worshippers of the saints or of fetishes , who do not recognize the material from which the fetish is made , or the human origin from which the saint has sprung '' stevenson 's jekyll and hyde was influenced by lombroso 's theory , with the criminal , evil hyde being described as '' ape-like '' lombroso differentiated himself from his predecessor and rival , cesare beccaria , through depicting his positivist school in opposition to beccaria 's classist one ( which centered around the idea that criminal behavior is born out of free will rather than inherited physical traits ) in a review of the man of genius they stated , '' here we have hypothesis claiming to be the result of strict scientific investigation and reluctant conviction , bolstered up by half-told truths , misrepresentations and assumptions other physical afflictions that lombroso connected with degeneracy included rickets , emaciation , sterility , lefthandedness , unconsciousness , stupidity , somnambulism , smallness or disproportionality of the body , and amnesia in criminal woman , as introduced in an english translation by nicole hahn rafter and mary gibson , lombroso used his theory of atavism to explain women 's criminal offending according to lombroso , criminal appearance was not just based on inherited physiognomy such as nose or skull shape , but also could be judged through superficial features like tattoos on the body after he died , his skull and brain were measured according to his own theories by a colleague as he requested in his will ; his head was preserved in a jar and is still displayed with his collection at the museum of psychiatry and criminology in turin this law gave psychiatrists rein within the criminal insane asylum , validating the field of psychiatry through giving the psychiatrists the sole authority to define and treat the causes of criminal behavior ( a position which lombroso argued for from his early teaching days to his death ) in the text , lombroso outlines a comparative analysis of '' normal women '' opposed to '' criminal women '' such as '' the prostitute in order to justify which geniuses were 'degenerate ' or insane , lombroso judged each genius by whether or not they displayed '' degenerate symptoms '' , which included precocity , longevity , versatility , and inspiration judges and lawyers backed beccaria 's classist school , tending to favor the idea that wrongdoers are breaking a societal contract with the option to exercise free will , tying into beccaria 's classist school of social misbehavior as an atheist lombroso discusses his views on the paranormal and spiritualism in his book after death – what ? ( 1909 ) which he believed the existence of spirits and claimed the medium eusapia palladino was genuine lombroso further cited certain personality traits as markers of degeneracy , such as '' a fondness for special words '' and '' the inspiration of genius '' lombroso 's theory has been cited as possibly '' the most influential doctrine '' in all areas studying human behavior , and indeed , its impact extended far and wide the article questioned the scientific legitimacy of the society for psychical research for investigating palladino a medium who had a reputation of being a fraud and imposter and was surprised that lombroso had been deceived by palladino
