the authority of the lordship of ireland 's government was seldom extended throughout the island of ireland at any time during its existence but was restricted to the pale around dublin , and some provincial towns , including cork , limerick , waterford , wexford and their hinterlands it owed its origins to the decision of a leinster dynast , diarmait mac murchada ( diarmuid macmorrough ) , to bring in a norman knight based in wales , richard de clare , 2nd earl of pembroke ( alias 'strongbow ' ) , to aid him in his battle to regain his throne , after being overthrown by a confederation led by the new irish high king ( the previous incumbent had protected macmurrough ) henry ii of england invaded ireland to control strongbow , who he feared was becoming a threat to the stability of his own kingdom on its western fringes ( there had been earlier fears that saxon refugees might use either ireland or flanders as a base for a counter-offensive after 1066 ) ; much of the later plantagenet consolidation of south wales was in furtherance of holding open routes to ireland in the process he accepted the fealty of the gaels kings at dublin in november 1171 and summoned the synod of cashel in 1172 , this bringing the irish church into conformity with english and european norms at the oxford parliament in may 1177 , henry replaced william fitzaldelm and granted john his irish lands , so becoming lord of ireland ( dominus hiberniae ) in 1177 when he was 10 years old , with the territory being known in english as the lordship of ireland . following the deaths of john 's older brothers he became king of england in 1199 , and so the lordship of ireland , instead of being a separate country ruled by a junior norman prince , came under the direct rule of the angevin crown in the legal terminology of john 's successors , the '' lordship of ireland '' referred to the sovereignty vested in the crown of england ; the corresponding territory was referred to as the '' land of ireland '' the norman and english colonists exhibited a tendency to adopt much of the native culture and language , becoming '' gaelicized '' or in the words of some '' more irish than the irish themselves '' it had been a common practice for the norman lordships as well as government forces to recruit the native irish who were allied to them or living in english controlled areas ( i.e some of the more notable among those clans who had formerly cooperated with the english but became increasingly alienated until turning openly anti-norman and a thorn in the side of the dublin administration were the o'connor falys , the macmurrough-kavanagh dynasty , the byrnes and the o'mores of leix historians refer to a gaelic revival or resurgence as occurring between 1350 and 1500 , by which time the area ruled for the crown – '' the pale '' – had shrunk to a small area around dublin most clans remained loyal to the crown most of the time , at least in theory , but using a gaelic-style system of alliances based on mutual favours , centered on the lord deputy who was usually the current earl of kildare the title was changed by the crown of ireland act passed by the irish parliament in 1542 when , on henry viii 's demand , he was granted a new title , king of ireland , with the state renamed the kingdom of ireland
