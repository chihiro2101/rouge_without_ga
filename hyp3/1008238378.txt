one collodion process , the tintype , was in limited use for casual portraiture by some itinerant and amusement park photographers as late as the 1930s , and the wet plate collodion process was still in use in the printing industry in the 1960s for line and tone work ( mostly printed material involving black type against a white background ) since it was much cheaper than gelatin film in large volumes watch : george eastman house '' the collodion process – photographic processes '' the getty museum : the wet collodion process step by step wet plate photography collodion : material safety data sheet compound w data sheet world wet plate day getting started in wetplate collodion photography old photography process : collodion wet plate the process was also very fast for the time , requiring only a few seconds to expose an image in daylight , rather than 30 seconds or more for other forms of photography available in the mid-1800s the extreme inconvenience of exposing wet collodion in the field led to many attempts to develop a dry collodion process , which could be exposed and developed some time after coating : emulsions created in this manner could be used wet , but they were often coated on the plate and preserved in similar ways to the dry process when a metal plate is coated with collodion , charged with silver nitrate , exposed , and developed , it produces a direct positive image , although 'backwards ' on the plate the collodion process , thus combined desirable qualities of the calotype process ( enabling the photographer to make a theoretically unlimited number of prints from a single negative ) and the daguerreotype ( creating a sharpness and clarity that could not be achieved with paper negatives ) as collodion is a sticky and transparent medium , and can be soaked in a solution of silver nitrate while wet , it is ideal for coating stable surfaces such as glass or metal for photography however , at the same time , potassium nitrate also formed , from the potassium ions in the iodide and the nitrate ions in the silver 3 the wet plate process is used by a number of artists and experimenters who prefer its aesthetic qualities to those of the more modern gelatin silver process this was an improvement over the calotype process , discovered by henry fox talbot , which relied on paper negatives , and the daguerreotype , which produced a one-of-a-kind positive image and could not be replicated image : theodore roosevelt on broken glass.jpg thumb this deteriorated dry plate portrait of theodore roosevelt is similar to a wet plate image but has substantial differences the largest collodion glass plate negatives produced in the nineteenth century were made in sydney , australia , in 1875 during the 1880s , the collodion process was largely replaced by dry plate—glass plates with a photographic emulsion of silver halides suspended in gelatin the dry gelatin emulsion was not only more convenient , but it could also be made much more sensitive , greatly reducing exposure times , john coffer , joni sternbach , surf site tin type , 2015 , damiani editore , milan david emitt adams , mark osterman , france scully osterman , jack dabaghian , lindsey ross , meg turner , and paul d'orléans/ susan mclaughlin 'the alchemists ' , 1903 magazine , issue 1 , 2016 james walker and luther gerlach wet plate/collodion is also a relatively inexpensive process compared to its predecessor , and does not require polishing equipment or the extremely toxic fuming boxes needed for the daguerreotype it was used for portraiture , landscape work , architectural photography and art photography below is an example of the preparation of a collodion emulsion , from the late 19th century this is then poured into the other half of the collodion ; the bromine collodion dropped in , slowly , while stirring with glass as the medium , the cost per image was also far less than special silver-plated copper plates , and more durable than paper negatives
