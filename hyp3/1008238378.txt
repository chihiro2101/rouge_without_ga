image : theodore roosevelt on broken glass.jpg thumb this deteriorated dry plate portrait of theodore roosevelt is similar to a wet plate image but has substantial differences during the 1880s , the collodion process was largely replaced by dry plate—glass plates with a photographic emulsion of silver halides suspended in gelatin the dry gelatin emulsion was not only more convenient , but it could also be made much more sensitive , greatly reducing exposure times one collodion process , the tintype , was in limited use for casual portraiture by some itinerant and amusement park photographers as late as the 1930s , and the wet plate collodion process was still in use in the printing industry in the 1960s for line and tone work ( mostly printed material involving black type against a white background ) since it was much cheaper than gelatin film in large volumes , john coffer , joni sternbach , surf site tin type , 2015 , damiani editore , milan david emitt adams , mark osterman , france scully osterman , jack dabaghian , lindsey ross , meg turner , and paul d'orléans/ susan mclaughlin 'the alchemists ' , 1903 magazine , issue 1 , 2016 james walker and luther gerlach this was an improvement over the calotype process , discovered by henry fox talbot , which relied on paper negatives , and the daguerreotype , which produced a one-of-a-kind positive image and could not be replicated the collodion process , thus combined desirable qualities of the calotype process ( enabling the photographer to make a theoretically unlimited number of prints from a single negative ) and the daguerreotype ( creating a sharpness and clarity that could not be achieved with paper negatives ) as collodion is a sticky and transparent medium , and can be soaked in a solution of silver nitrate while wet , it is ideal for coating stable surfaces such as glass or metal for photography when a metal plate is coated with collodion , charged with silver nitrate , exposed , and developed , it produces a direct positive image , although 'backwards ' on the plate wet plate/collodion is also a relatively inexpensive process compared to its predecessor , and does not require polishing equipment or the extremely toxic fuming boxes needed for the daguerreotype with glass as the medium , the cost per image was also far less than special silver-plated copper plates , and more durable than paper negatives the process was also very fast for the time , requiring only a few seconds to expose an image in daylight , rather than 30 seconds or more for other forms of photography available in the mid-1800s it was used for portraiture , landscape work , architectural photography and art photography the largest collodion glass plate negatives produced in the nineteenth century were made in sydney , australia , in 1875 3 the wet plate process is used by a number of artists and experimenters who prefer its aesthetic qualities to those of the more modern gelatin silver process the extreme inconvenience of exposing wet collodion in the field led to many attempts to develop a dry collodion process , which could be exposed and developed some time after coating however , at the same time , potassium nitrate also formed , from the potassium ions in the iodide and the nitrate ions in the silver below is an example of the preparation of a collodion emulsion , from the late 19th century this is then poured into the other half of the collodion ; the bromine collodion dropped in , slowly , while stirring : emulsions created in this manner could be used wet , but they were often coated on the plate and preserved in similar ways to the dry process watch : george eastman house '' the collodion process – photographic processes '' the getty museum : the wet collodion process step by step wet plate photography collodion : material safety data sheet compound w data sheet world wet plate day getting started in wetplate collodion photography old photography process : collodion wet plate
