etioplasts are the precursors of chloroplasts chromoplasts : coloured plastids for pigment synthesis and storage gerontoplasts : control the dismantling of the photosynthetic apparatus during plant senescence leucoplasts : colourless plastids for terpene synthesis ; leucoplasts sometimes differentiate into more specialized plastids : amyloplasts : for starch storage and detecting gravity ( for geotropism ) elaioplasts : for storing fat proteinoplasts : for storing and modifying protein tannosomes : for synthesizing and producing tannins and polyphenols depending on their morphology and function , plastids have the ability to differentiate , or redifferentiate , between these and other forms the number of genome copies per plastid is variable , ranging from more than 1000 in rapidly cell division , which , in general , contain few plastids , to 100 or fewer in mature cells , where plastid divisions have given rise to a large number of plastids in 2014 , evidence of possible plastid genome loss was found in rafflesia lagascae , a non-photosynthetic parasitic flowering plant , and in polytomella , a genus of non-photosynthetic green algae muroplasts : also known as cyanoplasts or cyanelles , the chloroplasts of glaucophyte algae are similar to plant chloroplasts , except that they have a peptidoglycan cell wall that is similar to that of prokaryote the plastid of photosynthetic paulinella species is often referred to as the 'cyanelle ' or chromatophore , and is used in photosynthesis ; it had a much more recent endosymbiotic event about 90–140 million years ago , and is the only other known primary endosymbiosis event of cyanobacteria as an example , in chloroplasts of the moss physcomitrella patens , a protein employed in dna mismatch repair ( msh1 ) interacts with proteins employed in recombinational repair ( reca and recg ) to maintain plastid genome stability the primary endosymbiotic event of the archaeplastida is hypothesized to have occurred around 1.5 billion years ago and enabled eukaryotes to carry out oxygenic photosynthesis three evolutionary lineages in the archaeplastida have since emerged in which the plastids are named differently : chloroplasts in green algae and plants , rhodoplasts in red algae , and muroplasts in the glaucophytes for example , chloroplasts in plants and green algae have lost all phycobilisomes , the light harvesting complexes found in cyanobacteria , red algae and glaucophytes , but instead contain stroma and grana thylakoids the plastid of photosynthetic paulinella species is often referred to as the 'cyanelle ' or chromatophore , and had a much more recent endosymbiotic event about 90–140 million years ago ; it is the only known primary endosymbiosis event of cyanobacteria outside of the archaeplastida the plastid was a sister to the '' ps-clade '' ( of the cyanobacteria genera prochlorococcus and synechococcus ) , which is a different sister clade to the plastids belonging to the archaeplastida in contrast to primary plastids derived from primary endosymbiosis of a prokaryoctyic cyanobacteria , complex plastids originated by secondary endosymbiosis in which a eukaryotic organism engulfed another eukaryotic organism that contained a primary plastid algae with complex plastids derived by secondary endosymbiosis of a red alga include the heterokonts , haptophytes , cryptomonads , and most dinoflagellates ( rhodoplasts ) ) , toxoplasmosis ( toxoplasma gondii ) , and many other human or animal diseases also harbor a complex plastid ( although this organelle has been lost in some apicomplexans , such as cryptosporidium parvum , which causes cryptosporidiosis ) some dinoflagellates and sea slugs , in particular of the genus elysia , take up algae as food and keep the plastid of the digested alga to profit from the photosynthesis ; after a while , the plastids are also digested
