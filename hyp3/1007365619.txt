psycholinguistics is an interdisciplinary field that consists of researchers from a variety of different backgrounds , including psychology , cognitive science , linguistics , speech and language pathology , and discourse analysis psycholinguists study how people acquire and use language , according to the following main areas : language acquisition : how do children acquire language ? language comprehension : how do people comprehend language ? language production : how do people produce language ? second language acquisition : how do people who already know one language acquire another one ? a researcher interested in language comprehension may study word recognition during reading , to examine the processes involved in the extraction of orthography , morphological , phonological , and semantic information from patterns in printed text a researcher interested in language production might study how words are prepared to be spoken starting from the conceptual or semantic level ( this concerns connotation , and possibly can be examined through the conceptual framework concerned with the semantic differential ) after the diminished popularity of the behaviorism model , ethology reemerged as a leading train of thought within psychology , allowing the subject of language , an innate behavior , to be examined once more within the scope of psychology the science of psycholinguistics , so called , began in 1936 when jacob kantor , a prominent psychologist at the time , used the term '' psycholinguistic '' as a description within his book an objective psychology of grammar psycholinguistics was used for the first time to talk about an interdisciplinary science '' that could be coherent '' , as well as being the title of psycholinguistics : a survey of theory and research problems , a 1954 book by charles e though there is still much debate , there are two primary theories on childhood language acquisition : the behaviorism perspective , whereby all language must be learned by the child ; and the innatist perspective , which believes that the abstract system of language can not be learned , but that humans possess an innate language faculty or an access to what has been called '' universal grammar '' chomsky posited that humans possess a special , innate ability for language , and that syntactic structures , such as recursion , are '' hard-wired '' in the brain when chomsky asserted that children acquiring a language have a vast search space to explore among all possible human grammars , there was no evidence that children received poverty of the stimulus all the rules of their language the view in favor of chomsky still holds that the human ability to use language ( specifically the ability to use recursion ) is qualitatively different from any sort of animal ability some see this system as '' structured cooperation between language-users '' who use conceptual and semantic deference in order to exchange meaning and knowledge , as well as give meaning to language , thereby examining and describing '' semantic processes bound by a 'stopping ' constraint which are not cases of ordinary deferring the theory of the '' semantic differential '' supposes universal distinctions , such as : himmelfarb ( 1993 ) p 57 typicality : that included scales such as '' regular–rare '' , '' typical–exclusive '' ; reality : '' imaginary–real '' , '' evident–fantastic '' , '' abstract–concrete '' ; complexity : '' complex–simple '' , '' unlimited–limited '' , '' mysterious–usual '' ; improvement or organization : '' regular–spasmodic '' , '' constant–changeable '' , '' organized–disorganized '' , '' precise–indefinite '' ; stimulation : '' interesting–boring '' , '' trivial–new '' these theories are typically concerned with the types of information , contained in the sentence , that the reader can use to build meaning , and at what point in reading does that information becomes available to the reader hence , in the sentence '' the evidence examined by the lawyer turned out to be unreliable '' , by the time the reader gets to the word '' examined '' he or she has committed to a reading of the sentence in which the evidence is examining something because it is the simplest parsing hence , in the sentence above , the reader would be able to make use of plausibility information in order to assume that '' the evidence '' is being examined instead of doing the examining when reading , saccades can cause the mind to skip over words because it does not see them as important to the sentence , and the mind completely omits it from the sentence or supplies the wrong word in its stead one of the most effective ways to explain the way people represent meanings using rule-governed languages is by observing and analyzing instances of speech errors , which include speech disfluencies like false starts , repetition , reformulation and constant pauses in between words or sentences , as well as slips of the tongue , like-blendings , substitutions , exchanges ( e.g it is useful to differentiate between three separate phases of language production : conceptualization : '' determining what to say '' ; formulation : '' translating the intention to say something into linguistic form '' ; execution : '' the detailed articulatory planning and articulation itself '' & nbsp ; the types of speech errors , with some examples , include : substitutions ( phoneme and lexical ) — replacing a sound with an unrelated sound , or a word with its antonym , saying such as '' verbal & nbsp ; outfit '' instead of '' verbal & nbsp ; output '' , or '' he rode his bike & nbsp ; tomorrow '' instead of '' yesterday '' , respectively ; blends — mixing two synonyms and saying '' my & nbsp ; stummy & nbsp ; hurts '' in place of either '' stomach '' or '' tummy '' ; exchanges ( phoneme aka spoonerisms and morpheme ) — swapping two onset sounds or two root words , and saying '' you & nbsp ; hissed my & nbsp ; mystery lectures '' instead of '' you & nbsp ; missed my & nbsp ; history lectures '' , or '' they 're & nbsp ; turking & nbsp ; talkish '' instead of '' they 're & nbsp ; talking & nbsp ; turkish '' , respectively ; morpheme shifts — moving a function morpheme such as '' -ly '' or '' -ed '' to a different word and saying '' easy enoughly '' instead of '' easily & nbsp ; enough '' , perseveration — incorrectly starting a word with a sound that was a part of the previous utterance , such as saying '' john & nbsp ; gave the & nbsp ; goy a ball '' instead of '' john gave the & nbsp ; boy a ball '' ; anticipation — replacing a sound with one that belongs later in the utterance , such as saying '' she drank a cot cup of tea '' instead of '' she drank a h ot cup of tea '' for example , severing the corpus callosum ( the bundle of nerves that connects the two hemispheres of the brain ) was at one time a treatment for some forms of epilepsy computational modelling , such as the drc model of reading and word recognition proposed by max coltheart and colleagues , is another methodology , which refers to the practice of setting up cognitive models in the form of executable computer programs psycholinguistics is concerned with the nature of the processes that the brain undergoes in order to comprehend and produce language another unanswered question in psycholinguistics is whether the human ability to use syntax originates from innate mental structures or social interaction , and whether or not some animals can be taught the syntax of human language it is much more difficult for adults to acquire second languages than it is for infants to learn their first language ( infants are able to learn more than one native language easily )
