by contrast , investment , as production to be added to the capital stock , is described as taking place over time ( '' per year '' ) , thus a flow marxian economics distinguishes between different forms of capital : constant capital , which refers to capital goods variable capital , which refers to labor-inputs , where the cost is '' variable '' based on the amount of wages and salaries paid during an employee 's contract/employment , fictitious capital , which refers to intangible representations or abstractions of physical capital , such as stocks , bonds and securities ( or '' tradable paper wealth '' ) earlier illustrations often described capital as physical items , such as tools , buildings , and vehicles that are used in the production process for example , investment in skills and education can be viewed as building up human capital or knowledge capital , and investments in intellectual property can be viewed as building up intellectual capital detailed classifications of capital that have been used in various theoretical or applied uses generally respect the following division : financial capital , which represents obligations , and is liquidated as money for trade , and owned by legal entities natural capital , which is inherent in ecologies and which increases the supply of human wealth social capital , which in private enterprise is partly captured as goodwill or brand value , but is a more general concept of inter-relationships between human beings having money-like value that motivates actions in a similar fashion to paid compensation this encompasses the aggregate body of all government-owned assets that are used to promote private industry productivity , including highways , railways , airports , water treatment facilities , telecommunications , electric grids , energy utilities , municipal buildings , public hospitals and schools , police , fire protection , courts and still others such terms reflect a wide consensus that nature and society both function in such a similar manner as traditional industrial infrastructural capital , that it is entirely appropriate to refer to them as different types of capital in themselves in particular , they can be used in the production of other goods , are not used up immediately in the process of production , and can be enhanced ( if not created ) by human effort however , this increasingly distinguishes means of capital investment , and collection of potential rewards for patent , copyright ( creative or individual capital ) , and trademark ( social trust or social capital ) instruments economist henry george argued that financial instruments like stocks , bonds , mortgages , promissory notes , or other certificates for transferring wealth is not really capital , because '' their economic value merely represents the power of one class to appropriate the earnings of another '' and '' their increase or decrease does not affect the sum of wealth in the community '' some thinkers , such as werner sombart and max weber , locate the concept of capital as originating in double-entry bookkeeping , which is thus a foundational innovation in capitalism , sombart writing in '' medieval and modern commercial enterprise '' that : ( quoted in '' accounting and rationality '' : the very concept of capital is derived from this way of looking at things ; one can say that capital , as a category , did not exist before double-entry bookkeeping on the other hand , constant capital refers to investment in non-human factors of production , such as plant and machinery , which marx takes to contribute only its own replacement value to the commodities it is used to produce since capital is defined by him as being goods of higher-order , or goods used to produce consumer goods , and derived their value from them , being future goods close parallel concepts are '' skill '' , '' ingenuity '' , '' leadership '' , '' trained bodies '' , or '' innate skills '' that can not reliably be reproduced by using any combination of any of the others above
