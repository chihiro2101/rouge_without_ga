the story repeats the theme of borges ' 1939 essay '' the total library '' ( '' la biblioteca total '' ) , which in turn acknowledges the earlier development of this theme by kurd lasswitz in his 1901 story '' the universal library '' ( '' die universalbibliothek '' ) : certain examples that aristotle attributes to democritus and leucippus clearly prefigure it , but its belated inventor is gustav theodor fechner , and its first exponent , kurd lasswitz however , the books in the library of babel are of bounded length ( '' each book is of four hundred and ten pages ; each page , of forty lines , each line , of some eighty letters '' ) , so the library can only contain a finite number of distinct strings , and thus can not contain all possible well-formed utterances in christopher nolan 's film interstellar , the protagonist , cooper , played by matthew mcconaughey , becomes trapped in a black hole which mirrors the library of babel ; cooper 's universe consists of an infinitely extended tesseract consisting of the back-side of a specific bookshelf full of books in his former family home in all directions , but at different times in the bookshelf 's history others believe that since all books exist in the library , somewhere one of the books must be a perfect index of the library 's contents ; some even believe that a messianic figure known as the '' man of the book '' has read it , and they travel through the library seeking him as the parallel universe collapses , darkness falls , and a character perishes in the void after uttering the words , '' o time thy pyramids , '' which are contained on the second-to-last page of a book in the library of babel there is no reference to monkeys or typewriters in '' the library of babel '' , although borges had mentioned that analogy in '' the total library '' : '' a half-dozen monkeys provided with typewriters would , in a few eternities , produce all the books in the british museum in any case , a library containing all possible books , arranged at random , might as well be a library containing zero books , as any true information would be buried in , and rendered indistinguishable from , all possible forms of false information ; the experience of opening to any page of any of the library 's books has been simulated by websites which create screenfuls of random letters in greg bear 's novel city at the end of time ( 2008 ) , the sum-runners carried by the protagonists are intended by their creator to be combined to form a 'babel ' , an infinite library containing every possible permutation of every possible character in every possible language peck wrote a novella entitled a short stay in hell ( 2012 ) in which the protagonist must find the book containing his life story in an afterlife replica of borges ' library of babel writes quine , '' the ultimate absurdity is now staring us in the face : a universal library of two volumes , one containing a single dot and the other a dash though the order and content of the books are random and apparently completely meaningless , the inhabitants believe that the books contain every possible ordering of just 25 basic grapheme ( 22 letters , the period , the comma , and space ) quine noted the interesting fact that the library of babel is finite ( that is , we will theoretically come to a point in history where everything has been written ) , and that any text that does n't fit in a single book can be reconstructed by finding a second book ( which is guaranteed to exist ) with the continuation daniel dennett 's 1995 book darwin 's dangerous idea includes an elaboration of the library of babel concept to imagine the set of all possible genetic sequences , which he calls the library of mendel , in order to illustrate the mathematics of genetic variation though the vast majority of the books in this universe are pure gibberish , the library also must contain , somewhere , every coherent book ever written , or that might ever be written , and every possible permutation or slightly erroneous version of every one of those books michael ende reused the idea of a universe of hexagonal rooms in the temple of a thousand doors from the neverending story , which contained all the possible characteristics of doors in the fantastic realm russell standish 's theory of nothing uses the concept of the library of babel to illustrate how an ultimate ensemble containing all possible descriptions would in sum contain zero information and would thus be the simplest possible explanation for the existence of the universe in his book the race with the tortoise ( berlin , 1919 ) , dr theodor wolff suggests that it is a derivation from , or a parody of , ram√≥n llull 's thinking machine another implication is an argument against certain proofs of the existence of god , as it is carried out by david hume using the thought experiment of a similar library of books generated not by human mind , but by nature the narrator notes that the library must contain all useful information , including predictions of the future , biographies of any person , and translations of every book in all languages
