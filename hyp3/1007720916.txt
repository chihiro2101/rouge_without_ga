eisenhower , the allied commander on the spot recognized darlan as commander of all french forces in the area and recognized his self-nomination as high commissioner of france in africa ( head of civil government ) for north and west africa on 14 november churchill persuaded an initially sceptical secret session of the house of commons , saying that eisenhower 's recognition of darlan was right , and even if it was not quite right , it had meant french rifles being pointed not at the allies , but at the axis : '' i am sorry to have to mention a point like this , but it makes a lot of difference to a soldier whether a man fires his gun at him , or at an enemy he also became minister of foreign affairs , minister of the interior , and minister of defence ( france ) , making him the de facto head of the vichy government darlan was immensely proud of the french navy which he had helped to build up , and after axis forces defeated france ( may–june 1940 ) , on 3 june he threatened that he would mutiny and lead the fleet to fight under the british flag in the event of an armistice darlan repeatedly refused british requests to place the whole fleet in british custody ( or in the french west indies ) , and in attempts to get the british to release french warships , gave a version of the armistice terms inconsistent with what the british knew from other sources to be the case general charles noguès , commander-in-chief of french forces in north africa , was dismayed at the armistice but accepted it partly ( he claimed ) because darlan would not let him have the french fleet to continue hostilities against the axis powers 17 in 1939 he was promoted to amiral de la flotte , a rank created specifically to put him on equal terms with the first sea lord of the royal navy that evening paul reynaud , feeling he lacked sufficient cabinet support for continuing the war , resigned as prime minister , and philippe pétain formed a new government with a view to seeking an armistice with germany in 1930 , he served as the french navy 's representative at the london naval treaty , and in 1932 he was promoted to vice-amiral but in april 1942 , at german insistence , darlan resigned his ministries , and was replaced by laval , whom the germans considered more trustworthy darlan negotiated the paris protocols of may 1941 with germany , in which germany made concessions on prisoners of war and occupation terms , and france agreed to german bases in french colonies the terms of the armistice called for the demobilisation and disarmament of the ships of the french navy under german supervision in their home ports ( mostly in the german-occupied zone ) 246 petain 's government signed an armistice ( 22 june 1940 ) but retained control of the territories known as '' vichy france '' after the capital moved to vichy in early july assassination in algiers : churchill , roosevelt , degaulle , and the murder of admiral darlan ( 1990 ) williams , charles , pétain , little brown ( time warner book group uk ) , london , 2005 , p on the afternoon of 24 december 1942 , fernand bonnier de la chapelle shot darlan in his headquarters ; darlan died a few hours later his order was obeyed ; not only in french north africa , but also by the vichy forces in french west africa with its potentially useful facilities at dakar during the night of 7–8 november , forces of a pro-allied group in algeria ( not connected with free france ) seized control of algiers in anticipation of the invasion only on 27 november did the germans try to seize the ships , but scuttling of the french fleet in toulon , mostly fulfilling darlan 's promise in 1940 to churchill harold macmillan , who was churchill 's adviser to eisenhower at the time of the assassination , wryly described darlan 's service and death by saying , '' once bought , he stayed bought darlan ordered all ships then in the atlantic ports ( which germany would soon occupy ) to steam to french overseas possessions , out of reach of the germans , although not necessarily of the italians darlan was unpopular with the allies – he was considered pompous , having asked eisenhower to provide 200 coldstream guards and grenadier guards as an honor company for the commemoration of napoleon 's victory at austerlitz 82–86 that day , according to jules moch , he declared that britain was finished so there was no point in continuing to fight , and he was concerned that if there was no armistice hitler would invade french north africa via franco 's spain to bring a quick end to the resistance and secure french co-operation , the allies came to an agreement with darlan , who as commander-in-chief could give the necessary orders the allies had anticipated little resistance from french forces in north africa , instead expecting them to accept the authority of general henri giraud , who was extracted from france to take charge 325–27 on 16 june churchill 's telegram arrived agreeing to an armistice ( france and britain were bound by treaty not to seek a separate peace ) provided the french fleet was moved to british ports as head of the navy he successfully used his political connections to lobby for a building programme to counter the rising threat from the kriegsmarine and regia marina
