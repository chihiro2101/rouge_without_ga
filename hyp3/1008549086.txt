selected species include ; penicillium albocoremium penicillium aurantiogriseum , a grain contaminant penicillium bilaiae , which is an agricultural inoculant penicillium camemberti , which is used in the production of camembert and brie cheeses penicillium candidum , which is used in making brie and camembert it has been reduced to synonymy with penicillium camemberti penicillium chrysogenum ( previously known as penicillium notatum ) , which produces the antibiotic penicillin penicillium claviforme penicillium commune penicillium crustosum penicillium digitatum , a citrus pathogen penicillium echinulatum produces mycophenolic acid penicillium expansum , a pathogen of apples and other fruit , produces patulin penicillium glabrum penicillium imranianum penicillium italicum , a citrus pathogen penicillium lacussarmientei penicillium lusitanum , isolated from marine habitat penicillium purpurogenum penicillium roqueforti , which is used in making roquefort , danish blue cheese , english blue stilton cheese , and gorgonzola cheese penicillium stoloniferum penicillium ulaiense , a citrus pathogen in asia penicillium verrucosum , a grain contaminant which produces ochratoxin a penicillium viridicatum the genus name is derived from the latin root penicillum , meaning '' painter 's brush '' , and refers to the chains of conidia that resemble a broom sexual reproduction involves the production of ascospores , commencing with the fusion of an archegonium and an antheridium , with sharing of nuclei commonly known in america as molds , they are among the main causes of food spoilage , especially species of subgenus penicillium the ability of these penicillium species to grow on seeds and other stored foods depends on their propensity to thrive in low humidity and to colonize rapidly by aerial dispersion while the seeds are sufficiently moist penicillium species are present in the air and dust of indoor environments , such as homes and public buildings several species of the genus penicillium play a central role in the production of cheese and of various meat products penicillium camemberti and penicillium roqueforti are the molds on camembert , brie , roquefort , and many other cheeses penicillium nalgiovense is used in soft mold-ripened cheeses , such as nal≈æovy ( ellischau ) cheese , and to improve the taste of sausages and hams , and to prevent colonization by other molds and bacteria in addition to their importance in the food industry , species of penicillium and aspergillus serve in the production of a number of biotechnologically produced enzymes and other macromolecules , such as gluconic , citric , and tartaric acids , as well as several pectinases , lipase , amylases , cellulases , and proteases the genus includes a wide variety of species molds that are the source molds of major antibiotics & nbsp ; notatum ) , was accidentally discovered by alexander fleming in 1929 , and found to inhibit the growth of gram-positive bacteria ( see beta-lactams ) its potential as an antibiotic was realized in the late 1930s , and howard florey and ernst chain purified and concentrated the compound this finding was based , in part , on evidence for functional mating type ( mat ) genes that are involved in fungal sexual compatibility , and the presence in the sequenced genome of most of the important genes known to be involved in meiosis penicillium chrysogenum is of major medical and historical importance as the original and present-day industrial source of the antibiotic penicillin prior to 2013 , when the '' one fungus , one name '' nomenclature change came into effect , penicillium was used as the genus for anamorph ( clonal forms ) of fungi and talaromyces was used for the teleomorph ( sexual forms ) of fungi
