early greek philosophy martin west , in 'oxford history of the classical world ' , j.boardman , j.griffin and o.murray ( eds ) , oxford university press 1986 , page 121 around the time that the clouds was produced , democritus at abdera was developing an atomism of the cosmos and hippocrates at cos was establishing an empirical and science-like approach to medicine sommerstein , penguin classics 1975 , page 16 there is a famous story , as reported for example by aelian , according to which socrates cheerfully rose from his seat during the performance of the clouds and stood in silent answer to the whispers among foreigners in the festival audience : '' who is socrates ? '' clouds ( 1970 ) , page xix aristophanes : lysistrata , the acharnians , the clouds a.sommerstein , penguin classics 1973 , page 109 aristophanes ' plays however were generally unsuccessful in shaping public attitudes on important questions , as evidenced by their ineffectual opposition to the peloponnesian war , demonstrated in the play lysistrata , and to populists such as cleon zuckert , university of chicago press 1996 , page 135 the practice of asceticism ( as for example idealized by the chorus in lines 412–19 ) , disciplined , introverted thinking ( as described by the chorus in lines 700–6 ) and conversational dialectic ( as described by socrates in lines 489–90 ) appear to be caricatures of socratic behaviours later described more sympathetically by plato sommerstein , penguin classics 1973 , pages 108 he was forty-five years old and in good physical shape when the clouds was produced clouds ( 1970 ) , page xviii yet he had a face that lent itself easily to caricature by mask-makers , possibly a contributing reason for the frequent characterization of him by comic poets there he meets a student who tells him about some of the recent discoveries made by socrates , the head of the thinkery , including a new unit of measurement for ascertaining the distance jumped by a flea ( a flea 's foot , created from a minuscule imprint in wax ) , the exact cause of the buzzing noise made by a gnat ( its rear end resembles a trumpet ) and a new use for a large pair of compasses ( as a kind of fishing-hook for stealing cloaks from pegs over the gymnasium wall ) the aristophanic socrates is much more interested in physical speculations than is plato 's socrates , yet it is possible that the real socrates did take a strong interest in such speculations during his development as a philosopher the socratic movement paul vander waerdt , cornell university press 1994 , page 74 and there is some support for this in plato 's dialogues phaedo 96a and timaeus sommerstein , penguin classics 1973 , pages 16–17 the scientific speculations of ionian thinkers such as thales in the sixth century were becoming commonplace knowledge in aristophanes ' time and this had led , for instance , to a growing belief that civilized society was not a gift from the gods but rather had developed gradually from primitive man 's animal-like existence it reproaches the audience for the play 's failure at the festival , where it was beaten by the works of inferior authors , and it praises the author for originality and for his courage in lampooning influential politicians such as cleon clouds ( 1970 ) , pages xxii according to yet another view , the clouds can best be understood in relation to plato 's works , as evidence of a historic rivalry between poetic and philosophical modes of thought the clouds translated by ian johnston the clouds : a study guide john curtis franklin – aristophanes clouds essay on satire in aristophanes 's the clouds has a very good analysis of the clouds and on satire in general the battle of ideas had led to some unlikely friendships that cut across personal and class differences , such as between the socially alert pericles and the unworldly anaxagoras , and between the handsome aristocrat , alcibiades , and the ugly plebeian , socrates sommerstein , penguin classics 1975 , page 31 in fact one of the plays that defeated the clouds in 423 was called connus , written by ameipsias , and it too lampooned socrates the spartans had recently stopped their annual invasions of attica after the athenians had taken spartan hostages in the battle of sphacteria in 425 and this , coupled with a defeat suffered by the athenians at the battle of delium in 424 , had provided the right conditions for a truce cleon , the populist leader of the pro-war faction in athens , was a target in all aristophanes ' early plays and his attempts to prosecute aristophanes for slander in 426 had merely added fuel to the fire references in the same parabasis to a play by eupolis called maricas produced in 421 bce and criticism of the populist politician hyperbolus who was ostracized in 416 indicate that the second version of the clouds was probably composed somewhere between 421–16 bce since cleon died in 422 it can be assumed that this appeal was retained from the original production in 423 and thus the extant play must be a partial revision of the original play superior argument sides with justice and the gods , offering to prepare pheidippides for an earnest life of discipline , typical of men who respect the old ways ; inferior argument , denying the existence of justice , offers to prepare him for a life of ease and pleasure , typical of men who know how to talk their way out of trouble later , in the agon between strepsiades and his son , a line of dialogue in iambic trimeter ( 1415 ) – adapted from euripides ' alcestis – is inserted into a speech in iambic tetrameter , a transition that seems uncharacteristically clumsy clouds ( 1970 ) , pages xiv–xv socrates is presented in the clouds as a petty thief , a fraud and a sophist with a specious interest in physical speculations the philosopher descends and quickly begins the induction ceremony for the new elderly student , the highlight of which is a parade of the clouds , the patron goddesses of thinkers and other layabouts freed from political and war-time issues , aristophanes focuses in the clouds on a broader issue that underlies many conflicts depicted in his plays – the issue of old versus new , or the battle of ideas the play is unusually serious for an old comedy and possibly this was the reason why the original play failed at the city dionysia moreover , the trial of socrates followed athens ' traumatic defeat by sparta , many years after the performance of the play , when suspicions about the philosopher were fuelled by public animosity towards his disgraced associates such as alcibiades the clouds step forward to address the audience a second time , demanding to be awarded first place in the festival competition , in return for which they promise good rains – otherwise they 'll destroy crops , smash roofs and spoil weddings
