the 1848 young ireland rebellion under thomas davis , though occurring at the start of the famine , was hardly impacted upon by the famine , as much as by the clash between the '' constitutional '' nationalism and catholicism of o'connell and the pluralist republicanism of davis historians have speculated that , such was the economic and social impact on ireland , the nation was numbed into inaction for decades afterwards ; in other words , that politics mattered less to people than survival after the traumatic experiences of the late 1840s and early 1850s though its electorate was a small part of the population ( as elsewhere in the united kingdom of great britain and ireland ) , those irish privileged to vote continued until the mid-1870s to vote for the two major british political parties , the conservatives and the liberals , with more votes and seats going to the latter , even though it had been the party of government during the famine although some believed the myth that queen victoria ( known in ireland in later decades as the '' famine queen '' ) had only donated a miserly £5 to famine relief , in fact the sum was £2,000 , the equivalent of £61,000 today , from her personal resources the famine was not the only reason for the decline of the language ( the general exclusion of irish from public life and the influence of the english-speaking clergy and middle classes also played a part ) but it was a conspicuous element this led to the creation of an ireland which thought of itself as essentially english-speaking , though with a persistent and influential reaction in the form of organisations such as the gaelic league and the growth of a network of urban irish-speaking activists from the late nineteenth century on the emigration of numerous irish speakers to america as an immediate or long-term result of the famine led to a movement there for the maintenance of the irish language this was marked in part by the foundation of philo-celtic societies and the founding of the monthly journal an gaodhal in 1881 , the first such publication anywhere in which irish was extensively used john mitchel , a journalist by trade ( who had written for thomas davis 's newspaper , the nation before leaving to set up his own paper , only to be arrested , tried for sedition and transported to the penal colony of van diemen 's land ) proved to be a superb campaigner against british rule in ireland analysing the famine , he wrote : mitchel 's commentary expressed the anger felt by many emigrants , who saw themselves as the dispossessed , forced from ireland by a famine they blamed on british government policies it was no accident that the president of dáil éireann , éamon de valera in 1920 chose to travel to the united states , not elsewhere , in his efforts to get the irish republic recognised and accepted , or that when michael collins launched special bonds to fund the new republic , many were sold to irish americans a claim was made by a us professor of law , francis boyle that the famine was genocide by the english against the irish , meaning that the famine was part of a deliberate policy of planned extermination one us historian , james mullin , insists that what happened can be described as genocide , sometimes accusing other historians , statisticians , and researchers who state otherwise of pushing a british point of view , or of revisionism , rewriting history to make excuses for british imperialism all historians generally agree that british policies during the famine ( particularly those applied by the ministry of lord john russell ) were misguided , ill-informed , and counter-productive , and that had a similar crisis occurred in england instead of ireland then the government 's response would have been very different the poverty , evictions , slave-like workshops where workers paid off the cost of their tickets , and the overcrowding and unhygienic conditions on emigration ships , all combined to make the journey of emigrating as great a risk as staying and trying to survive starvation whether the british empire made a conscious decision to allow 1 million irish people to die , or whether the government was negligent , are issues in the debate over whether that episode of irish history was due primarily to famine or genocide beyond these important cultural aspects , emigration was a continuing and embarrassing fact of irish political life in the 1940s , and there was no natural constituency for the famine victims , who had died or emigrated the 1990s marked a significant shift in attitudes towards commemorating the famine , as hundreds of events took place in ireland and throughout the irish diaspora , some of which received sponsorship from the national famine commemoration committee based in the department of the taoiseach , led by td avril doyle historians re-examined all aspects of the famine experience ; from practical issues like the number of deaths and emigrants , to the long-term impact it had on society , sexual behaviour , land holdings , property rights and the entire irish identity , personified in the conservatism of cardinal cullen , that persisted into the 1900s his book publishing deal with harper collins originated from a number of songs he had written about an gorta mór , resulting in the publication of his best selling 'documentary novel ' of the famine – the whitest flower ( harpercollins , london , sydney , toronto , 1998 ) eimear quinn 's version featured in the pierce brosnan movie – the nephew , while the song found a new life in america with the recording and widespread pbs broadcasting of it as part of the group celtic woman 's rise to prominence there the song is written in a traditional narrative style song form where there are no choruses , the hook of the song being contained in the last line of each stanza with the pull of the story being used to keep the listener 's interest alive it is a lament by a mother for a child she buries there during aimsir an drochshaoil ( 'the time of the bad life ' – the famine ) another of graham 's famine songs , '' ochón an ghorta mhóir / lament of the great hunger '' , was commissioned by the irish government , as part of the ceól reoite ( frozen music – after goethe 's 'architecture is frozen music ' ) millennial project this melody in turn inspired graham to write the lyric – you raise me up , which has been recorded by some 400 artists ( including westlife , josh groban , brian kennedy and secret garden , daniel o'donnell , helene fischer , il divo , russell watson and paul potts ) and has become one of the most successful songs in popular music history in response to the view handed down at the time of ireland 's famine that '' the judgement of god…sent the calamity to teach the irish a lesson , that calamity must not be too much mitigated '' ( charles e trevelyan – permanent assistant secretary at the british treasury with prime responsibility for famine relief in ireland ) , graham 's song calls to task a vengeful god : in august 2012 brendan graham composed and presented from famine to freedom – ireland to australia , a commemoration in word and song of those who suffered during an gorta mór – the great irish famine – and of those who fled the famine to establish a new life australia graham wrote a new song called , '' orphan girl '' , dedicated to the memory of the 4,112 , mainly teenage irish orphan girls , who were given a free passage to australia from workhouses in every county of ireland between 1848 and 1850 the commemoration in words and song was a community day of celebration and remembering , especially for those who are descendants of these irish workhouse young women.for more information see www.irishfaminememorial.org more recently in march 2013 the possible dreams choir toured victoria in australia , singing '' orphan girl '' ( sung by fortunate and nomcebo ) and '' you raise me up '' as part of their voices for the voiceless tour murphy , abject loyalty : nationalism and monarchy in ireland during the reign of queen victoria ( cork university press , 2001 ) joseph o'connor , star of the sea liam o'flaherty , famine
