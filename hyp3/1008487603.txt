the design of the product and how it is produced are determined , not by the producers who make it ( the workers ) , nor by the consumers of the product ( the buyers ) , but by the capitalist class who besides accommodating the worker 's manual labour also accommodate the intellectual labour of the engineer and the industrial designer who create the product in order to shape the taste of the consumer to buy the goods and services at a price that yields a maximal profit despite the ideological promise of industrialization—that the mechanization of industrial production would raise the mass of the workers from a brutish life of subsistence existence to honorable work—the division of labour inherent to the capitalist mode of production thwarted the human nature ( gattungswesen ) of the worker and so rendered each individual into a mechanistic part of an industrialized system of production , from being a person capable of defining their value through direct , purposeful activity furthermore , with such a reified system of industrial production , the profit ( exchange value ) generated by the sale of the goods and services ( products ) that could be paid to the workers is instead paid to the capitalist classes : the functional capitalist , who manages the means of production ; and the rentier capitalism , who owns the means of production whatever the character of a person 's consciousness ( will and imagination ) , societal existence is conditioned by their relationships with the people and things that facilitate survival , which is fundamentally dependent upon cooperation with others , thus , a person 's consciousness is determined inter-subjectively ( collectively ) , not subjectively ( individually ) , because humans are a social animal in the course of economic development when a new type of economy displaced an old type of economy—agrarian feudalism superseded by mercantilism , in turn superseded by the industrial revolution—the rearranged economic order of the social classes favored the social class who controlled the technology ( the means of production ) that made possible the change in the relations of production conceptually , in the term species-essence , the word species describes the intrinsic human mental essence that is characterized by a '' plurality of interests '' and '' psychological dynamism , '' whereby every individual has the desire and the tendency to engage in the many activities that promote mutual human survival and psychological well-being , by means of emotional connections with other people , with society in discussion of '' random materialism '' ( matérialisme aléatoire ) , french philosopher louis althusser criticized such a teleology ( goal-oriented ) interpretation of marx 's theory of alienation because it rendered the proletariat as the subject of history ; an interpretation tainted with the hegelian idealism of the '' philosophy of the subject , '' which he criticized as the '' bourgeois ideology of philosophy '' ( see history and class consciousness 1923 by györgy lukács ) furthermore , in the capitalist mode of production the philosophic collusion of religion in justifying the relations of production facilitates the realization and then worsens the alienation ( entfremdung ) of the worker from their humanity ; it is a socio-economic role independent of religion being '' opiate of the people '' it is , to use an expression of hegel , in its abasement , the indignation at that abasement , an indignation to which it is necessarily driven by the contradiction between its human nature and its condition of life , which is the outright , resolute and comprehensive negation of that nature a person 's mind should be free and conscious , instead it is controlled and directed by the capitalist , '' the external character of labor for the worker appears in the fact that it is not his own but someone else 's , that it does not belong to him , that in it he belongs , not to himself , but to another the capitalist economy 's arrangement of the relations of production provokes social conflict by pitting worker against worker in a competition for '' higher wages '' , thereby alienating them from their mutual economic interests ; the effect is a false consciousness , which is a form of ideological control exercised by the capitalist bourgeoisie through its cultural hegemony whereas a person 's gattungswesen does not exist independently of specific , historically conditioned activities , the essential nature of a human being is actualized when an individual—within their given historical circumstance—is free to subordinate their will to the internal demands they have imposed upon themselves by their imagination and not the external demands imposed upon individuals by other people in the resultant communist society , the fundamental relation of the workers to the means of production would be equal and non-conflictual because there would be no artificial distinctions about the value of a worker 's labour ; the worker 's humanity ( gattungswesen ) thus respected , men and women would not become alienated '' by means of commodification , the labor power of the worker is reduced to wages ( an exchange value ) ; the psychological estrangement ( entfremdung ) of the worker results from the unmediated relation between his productive labor and the wages paid to him for the labor the direct distribution of the fruits of the labour of each worker to fulfill the interests of the working class—and thus to an individuals own interest and benefit—will constitute an un-alienated state of labour conditions , which restores to the worker the fullest exercise and determination of their human nature in part i : '' feuerbach – opposition of the materialist and idealist outlook '' of the german ideology ( 1846 ) , karl marx said the following : things have now come to such a pass that the individuals must appropriate the existing totality of productive forces , not only to achieve self-activity , but also , merely , to safeguard their very existence aside from the workers having no control over the design-and-production protocol , alienation ( entfremdung ) broadly describes the conversion of labour ( work as an activity ) , which is performed to generate a use value ( the product ) , into a commodity , which—like products—can be assigned an exchange value
