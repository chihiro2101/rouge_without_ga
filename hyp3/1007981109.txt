however , no reliable fossil records of thuja exist in either western asia or europe , the possibility of a migration from asia through europe and into northeastern america ( the second dispersal event via the north atlantic landbridge as described above ) can be eliminated the closest relatives of thuja are thujopsis , distinct in its thicker foliage and stouter cones , and tetraclinis articulata ( ancient greek or , formerly classed in the genus and after which thuja is named ) , distinct in its quadrangular foliage ( not flattened ) and cones with four thick , woody scales within the genus the taxonomy is in flux , but most recent research based on molecular analysis of plastomes in the genus thuja showed evidence for a new grouping , with two sister clades : t in the 19th century thuja was commonly used as an externally applied tincture or ointment for the treatment of warts , ringworm and thrush , and a local injection of the tincture was used for treating genital wart the genus thuja , like many other forms of conifers , is represented by ancestral forms in cretaceous rocks of northern europe , and with the advance of time is found to migrate from northerly to more southerly regions , until during pliocene time it disappeared from europe thuja plicata is an important tree to the first nations people of the pacific northwest and is sometimes called '' canoe tree '' because of its use as a material for native american canoes thuja is in the cupressoid clade and is sister to the genus thujopsis another very distinct and only distantly related species , formerly treated as thuja orientalis , is now treated in a genus of its own , as platycladus the foliage is also readily eaten by deer , and where deer population density is high , can adversely affect the growth of young trees and the establishment of seedlings the five species in the genus thuja are small to large evergreen trees with flattened branchlets however , if pruning is needed , the tops of arborvitae can be pruned to a point and the sides can be sheared back with a hedge trimmer or pruners to manage the width koraiensis is native to both north and south korea and has a small population in the northern chinese province of jilin thuja is a monophyletic genus that sits within the order pinales in the cupressaceae the male cones are small , inconspicuous , and are located at the tips of the twigs the natives of canada used the scaled leaves of thuja occidentalis ( eastern white cedar ) to make a tea that has been shown to contain 50 & nbsp ; mg of vitamin c per 100 & nbsp ; grams ; this helped prevent and treat scurvy current research suggests that thuja originated in the americas and migrated to east asia via the bering landbridge in the miocene
