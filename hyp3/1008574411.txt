most of the energy applied to the voice coil is converted to heat , not sound ; all of the heat is ultimately passed to the pole piece , the rest of the magnet structure , and the frame since the voice coil gap is quite narrow ( clearances are typically in the low thousandths of an inch ) , rigidity is important to prevent rubbing of the voice coil against the magnet structure in the gap and also avoid extraneous motions they are also usually ill-suited to extended low bass response since the last octave of low frequency response increases size and expense considerably , and is increasingly uneconomic to attempt at high levels as in a pa application most have to do with controlling the motion of the cone so the electrical signal to the woofer 's voice coil is faithfully reproduced by the sound waves produced by the cone 's motion normally the crossover and speaker system , including the woofer , are expected to convert the electrical signal supplied by the amplifier to an acoustic signal of identical waveform without other interaction between the amplifier and speakers , although sometimes the amplifier and speakers are designed together with the speakers supplying distortion-correcting negative feedback to the amplifier good woofer design requires effectively converting a low frequency amplifier signal to mechanical air movement with high fidelity and acceptable efficiency , and is both assisted and complicated by the necessity of using a loudspeaker enclosure to couple the cone motion to the air the size of the enclosure is a function of the longest wavelengths ( lowest frequencies ) to be reproduced , and the woofer enclosure is much larger than required for midrange and tweeter if carefully done , this can improve performance ( both in 'tightness ' , and extension of low frequency performance ) considerably at the expense of flexibility ( the amplifier and the speaker are tied together permanently ) and cost because the characteristics of a loudspeaker can be measured , and to a considerable extent predicted , it is possible to design special circuitry that somewhat compensates for the deficiencies of a speaker system , inability to move '' in and out '' as far as many home woofers can ) , as they are intended for horn or large reflex enclosures problems include damping the cone cleanly without audible distortion so that it does not continue to move , causing ringing , when the instantaneous input signal falls to zero each cycle , and managing high excursions ( usually required to reproduce loud sounds ) with low distortion in this case , the equalization must be individually adjusted to match the particular characteristics of the loudspeaker systems used and the room in which they are used at ordinary sound pressure , most humans can hear down to about 20 & nbsp ; hz typically , design variances include : cabinets built for repeated shipping and handling , larger woofer cones to allow for higher sound pressure levels , more robust voice coils to withstand higher power , and higher suspension stiffness they added a motion sensor to the woofer , and used the signal corresponding to its actual motion to feedback as a control input to a specially designed amplifier
