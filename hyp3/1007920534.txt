it was first used as a leavening agent by native americans and was the subject of the first patent in the united states , issued in april 1790 the chemical leavening effects were accomplished by the activating of a base such as baking soda in the presence of liquid ( s ) and an acid such as sour milk , vinegar , lemon juice , or cream of tartar baking powder is made up of a base , an acid , and a buffering material to prevent the acid and base from reacting before their intended use primarily it is used to absorb moisture , and thus prolong shelf life of the compound by keeping the powder 's alkaline and acidic components dry so as not to react with each other prematurely in 2006 the rumford chemical works in east providence , rhode island were designated a national historic chemical landmark in recognition of baking powder 's impact in making baking easier , quicker , and more reliable file : the horsford cookbook 1877 2227mq61j 0 6w924d079.tiff the horsford cookbook , 1877 file : the horsford 1887 almanac and cook book.tiff the horsford 1887 almanac and cook book , 1887 file : the rumford cook book 1910 cover front.tiff the rumford cook book , 1910 in 2015 , cook 's country , an american tv show and magazine , evaluated six baking powders marketed to consumers by providing a second rise in the oven , double-acting baking powders increase the reliability of baked goods by rendering the time elapsed between mixing and baking less critical generally , one teaspoon ( 5 g or 1/6 oz ) of baking powder is used to raise a mixture of one cup ( 120 & nbsp ; g or 4oz ) of flour , one cup of liquid , and one egg early baking powder companies published their own cookbooks , to promote their new products , to educate cooks about exactly how and when to use them , and because cooks could not easily adapt recipes that were developed using different types of baking powder with pearlash , cooks were able to create new recipes for new types of cakes , cookies , and biscuits that were quicker and easier to make than yeast-based recipes the first to create a form of baking powder was english chemist and food manufacturer alfred bird in 1843 in 1846 , the first edition of catherine beecher 's cookbook domestic recipe book ( 1846 ) included a recipe for an early prototype of baking powder biscuits that used both baking soda and cream of tartar however , with baking powders that contain sodium acid pyrophosphate , excess alkaline substances can sometimes deprotonate the acid in two steps instead of the one that normally occurs , resulting in an offensive bitter taste to baked goods the creation of shelf-stable chemical combinations of sodium bicarbonate and cream of tartar is seen as marking the true introduction of baking powder in america , eben norton horsford , a student of justus von liebig , set out to create a flour fortifier and leavening agent when amelia simmons published american cookery ( 1792 ) , the first american cookbook , the recipes she included used three possible types of leavening : baker 's yeast , emptins ( from the leavings of brewer 's yeast ) , and pearlash however , if the mixture is acidic , baking powder 's additional acids remain unconsumed in the chemical reaction and often lend an unpleasant taste to food for example , one cup of flour , one egg , and one cup of buttermilk requires only ½ teaspoon of baking powder—the remaining leavening is caused by buttermilk acids reacting with ¼ teaspoon of baking soda its preparation was time-consuming , but could be accomplished by a housewife with a cast-iron kettle : it involved soaking fireplace ashes in water to make lye , and then boiling the lye to remove water and obtain '' salts '' nonetheless , bird 's creation of baking powder enabled cooks to take recipes for cakes such as the patriotically-named victoria sponge and make them rise higher alternatively , lemon juice can be substituted for some of the liquid in the recipe , to provide the required acidity to activate the baking soda cream of tartar , also known as tartaric acid or potassium bitartrate , was a by-product of wine-making and had to be imported from france and italy horsford 's research was interrupted by the american civil war , but in 1869 horsford finally created an already-mixed leavening agent by using cornstarch as a buffer between the publication of american cookery in 1796 , and the mid-1800s , cooks experimented with a variety of acids , alkalis , and mineral salts as possible chemical leaveners most commercially available baking powders are made up of sodium bicarbonate ( nahco 3 , also known as baking soda or bicarbonate of soda ) and one or more acid salts although cooks had used both sodium bicarbonate and cream of tartar in recipes , they had to purchase the ingredients individually and store them separately to prevent them from spoiling or reacting prematurely
