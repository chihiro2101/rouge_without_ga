the term '' stuffing '' or a '' stuffed animal '' evolved from this crude form of taxidermy dufresne 's methods spread to england in the early 19th century , where updated and non-toxic methods of preservation were developed by some of the leading naturalists of the day , including rowland ward and montague brown famous examples of modern anthropomorphic taxidermy include the work of artist adele morse who gained international attention with her '' stoned fox '' sculpture series and the work of artist sarina brewer , known for her siamese twin squirrels and flying monkeys partaking in human activities additional modern uses of taxidermy have been the use of '' faux taxidermy '' or fake animal heads that draw on the inspiration of traditional taxidermy rogue taxidermy ( sometimes referred to as '' taxidermy art '' ) is a form of mixed media sculpture rogue taxidermy art references traditional trophy or natural history museum taxidermy , but is not always constructed out of taxidermied animals , it can be constructed entirely from synthetic materials '' rogue taxidermy '' describes a wide variety of work , including work that is classified and exhibited as fine art the genre was born from forms of fine art that utilize some of the components found in the construction of a traditional taxidermy mount '' the definition of rogue taxidermy set forth by the individuals who formed the genre ( brewer , bibus , and marbury ) is : '' a genre of pop-surrealist art characterized by mixed media sculptures containing conventional taxidermy-related materials that are used in an unconventional manner '' interest in the collective 's work gave rise to an artistic movement referred to as the rogue taxidermy art movement , or alternately , the taxidermy art movement apart from describing a genre of fine art , the term '' rogue taxidermy '' has expanded in recent years and has also become an adjective applied to unorthodox forms of traditional taxidermy such as anthropomorphic mounts and composite mounts where two or more animals are spliced together ; sideshow gaffs of conjoined '' freak '' animals and mounts of jackalopes or other fictional creatures ) in addition to being the impetus for the art movement , the inception of the genre also marked a resurgence of interest in conventional ( traditional ) forms of taxidermy a traditional method that remains popular today involves retaining the original skull and leg bones of a specimen and using these as the basis to create a mannequin made primarily from wood wool ( previously tow or hemp wool was used ) and galvanised wire the carcass is then removed and the mould is used to produce a cast of the animal called a 'form ' glass eyes are then usually added to the display , and in some cases , artificial teeth , jaws , tongue , or for some birds , artificial beaks and legs can be used ( the skeleton and all accompanying musculature is still beneath the surface of the skin ) the animal is positioned into the desired pose , then placed into the chamber of a special freeze drying machine designed specifically for this application ; shrinkage , warping , and wrinkling ) the process can be done with reptiles , birds , and small mammals such as cats , rodents , and some dogs this is because it is the least invasive in terms of what is done to the animal 's body after death , which is a concern of owners ( most owners do not opt for a traditional skin mount ) in the case of large pets , such as dogs and cats , freeze drying is also the best way to capture the animal 's expression as it looked in life ( another important concern of owners ) instead , detailed photos and measurements are taken of the animal so a taxidermist can create an exact replica in resin or fiberglass that can be displayed in place of the real animal while the animal is unconscious , the hunter poses for photos with the animal while it is measured for the purpose of creating a replica , or to establish what size of prefabricated fiberglass trophy head can be purchased to most closely approximate the actual animal the hunter then displays the fiberglass head on the wall in lieu of the real animal 's head to commemorate the experience of the hunt a study skin is a taxidermic zoological specimen prepared in a minimalistic fashion that is concerned only with preserving the animal 's skin , not the shape of the animal 's body as the name implies , study skins are used for scientific study ( research ) , and are housed mainly by museums a study skin 's sole purpose is to preserve data , not to replicate an animal in a lifelike state study skins are dried in these positions to keep the end product as slender and streamlined as possible so large numbers of specimens can be stored side-by-side in flat file drawers , while occupying a minimum amount of space john hancock ( ornithologist ) carl akeley , the father of modern taxidermy jean-baptiste bécœur , inventor of arsenical soap william temple hornaday martha maxwell , first female naturalist to obtain and taxidermy her own specimens charles johnson maynard , ornithologist who discovered many new species and authored many notable publications charles wilson peale walter potter , victorian era creator of iconic anthropomorphic taxidermy jules verreaux james rowland ward chuck testa , gained internet fame in 2011 , becoming a popular meme with the phrase , '' nope , chuck testa ''
