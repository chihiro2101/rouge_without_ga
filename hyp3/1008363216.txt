hillforts in britain are known from the bronze age , but the great period of hillfort construction was during the iron age , between 700 bc and the roman conquest of britain in 43 ad in galicia , asturias , cantabria , basque country , province of ávila and northern portugal a castro is a fortified pre-roman iron age village , usually located on a hill or some naturally easy defendable place many of the megaliths from the bronze age such as menhirs and dolmens , which are frequently located near the castros , also pre-date the celts in portugal , asturias and galicia as well as in atlantic france , britain and ireland some hillforts have cairns inside their boundaries and there are many speculations about this phenomenon , the theories range from being a strange cult religion to just coincidence the same kind of area as they both like ( hill tops with commanding views of the local vicinity ) , the excavation at freestone hill in county kilkenny has shown that there was indeed a ditch cut out around the cairn , evidence that they had respect for the feature no matter what they decided to believe about it partially articulated remains of between 28 and 40 men , women and children at cadbury castle were thought by the excavator to implicate the cadbury population in a revolt in the 70s ad ( roughly contemporary with that of boudicca in the east of england ) , although this has been questioned by subsequent researchers the buildings inside , most of them circular in shape , some rectangular , were about long ; they were made out of stone with thatch roofs resting on a wood column in the centre of the building in wales , the hillfort at dinas powys was a late iron age hillfort reoccupied from the 5th-6th centuries ce ; similarly at castell dinas brân a hillfort of c.600 bce was reused in the middle ages , with a stone castle built there in the 13th century ce most of these forts were built or expanded between the fifth and fifteenth centuries , when they were used in the dukes ' wars , and against the invasion of teutonic order from the west latvian hillforts generally were a part of a complex consisting of the main fortress , the settlement around it , one or more burial fields and nearby ritual sites they would be functional as defensive strongholds when there were tensions and undoubtedly some of them were attacked and destroyed , but this was not the only , or even the most significant , factor in their construction '' one special feature about the finnish hillforts that while most of them are located these days within some distance from the sea , but earlier many of the forts were located by the sea , due to post-glacial rebound the iron age , smr.herefordshire.gov.uk danebury in hampshire , is the most thoroughly investigated iron age hillfort in britain , as well as the most extensively published most of the latvian hillforts were destroyed or abandoned during the livonian crusade in the 13th century , but some were still used in the 14th century outside greece and italy , which were more densely populated , the vast majority of settlements in the iron age were small , with perhaps no more than 50 & nbsp ; inhabitants beyond the simple definition of hillfort , there is a wide variation in types and periods from the bronze age to the middle ages michael avery has stated the traditional view of hillforts by saying , '' the ultimate defensive weapon of european prehistory was the hillfort of the first millennium b.c typically , a castro had one to five stone and earth walls , which complemented the natural defences of the hill abandoned forts were sometimes reoccupied and refortified under renewed threat of foreign invasion , such as the dukes ' wars in lithuania , and the successive invasions of britain by romans , saxons and vikings they served a range of purposes and were variously tribal centres , defended places , foci of ritual activity , and places of production castros vary in area from less than a hectare to some 50 hectare ones , and most were abandoned after the roman conquest of the territory the finnish word for hillfort is linnavuori ( plural linnavuoret ) , meaning fort hill or castle hill , or alternatively muinaislinna meaning ancient fort , as opposed to bare linna which refers to medieval or later fortifications the romans occupied some forts , such as the military garrison at hod hill , and the temple at brean down , but others were destroyed and abandoned a new period in hillfort development started during the 5th-8th centuries ad , when many new hillforts appeared , in most cases , along the main trades routes - rivers hillforts with strong walls are often located beside old trade routes and have an offensive character , whereas others are reclusive and were weakly fortified , probably only for hiding during raids during the roman iron age , some of the latvian hillforts ( like ķivutkalns ) were abandoned or became sparsely populated the crests ' more accessible parts were defended with walls of stone and outer walls in the slopes beneath are common one must be careful to not confuse a hill-fort with a 'ringfort ' - a medieval settlement - a common archaeological feature across the whole island of ireland , of which over 40,000 examples are known ; one source claims there may be 10,000 undiscovered ringforts one was to protect vilnius , the capital , and the other line in samogitia , was a major target for both orders in södermanland there are 300 , in uppland 150 , östergötland 130 , and 90 to 100 in each of bohuslän and gotland broch castro culture gord ( archaeology ) nuraghe oppidum pā , can refer to any māori village or defensive settlement in new zealand , but often refers to hillforts – fortified settlements with palisades and defensive terraces even in areas that were remote from the roman empire , such as southern sweden , numerous hillfort sites of this period have been found
