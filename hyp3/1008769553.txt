the boundary of that region is known as the event horizon because an observer outside it can not observe , become aware of , or be affected by events within the event horizon in 1974 , british physicist stephen hawking used quantum field theory in curved spacetime to show that in theory , the force of gravity at the event horizon was strong enough to cause energy to '' leak '' into the wider universe within a tiny distance of the event horizon careful analysis showed that if this happened , quantum effects would cause a '' partner wave '' carrying negative energy to be created and also pass into the black hole , reducing the black hole 's total mass , or energy in effect to an observer it would appear as if the gravitational force had somehow allowed the black hole 's energy to be reduced and the energy of the wider universe to be increased considering the thermal properties of black holes , and conservation laws affecting this process , hawking calculated that the visible outcome would be a very low level of exact black-body radiation - electromagnetic radiation produced as if emitted by a black body with a temperature inversely proportional to the mass of the black hole an important difference between the black hole radiation as computed by hawking and thermal radiation emitted from a black body is that the latter is statistical in nature , and only its average satisfies what is known as planck 's law of black-body radiation , while the former fits the data better thus thermal radiation contains information about the body that emitted it , while hawking radiation seems to contain no such information , and depends only on the mass , angular momentum , and charge of the black hole ( the no-hair theorem ) however , according to the conjectured gauge-gravity duality ( also known as the ads/cft correspondence ) , black holes in certain cases ( and perhaps in general ) are equivalent to solutions of quantum field theory at a non-zero temperature this means that no information loss is expected in black holes ( since the theory permits no such loss ) and the radiation emitted by a black hole is probably the usual thermal radiation the condition of local thermal equilibrium implies that the consistent extension of this local thermal bath has a finite temperature at infinity , which implies that some of these particles emitted by the horizon are not reabsorbed and become outgoing hawking radiation
