it includes lead vocals from brad delp , tommy decarlo , kimberley dahme , david victor , and tom scholz in 2014 boston embarked on the '' heaven on earth tour '' spanning the united states and japan with a lineup including scholz , pihl , decarlo , victor and ferrie initially , the lineup was to include former spock 's beard drummer and vocalist nick d'virgilio for its first month of shows , with neal then returning , but d'virgilio proved '' not the right fit '' and smith rejoined in his place one of the themes of boston 's album covers is the presence of a guitar-shaped spaceship , ostensibly a generation ship carrying the city of boston inside a domed city , with the city 's name emblazoned across the front their spaceship also appeared on their tours in the late 1980s , early 1990s , and early 2000s in the form of a giant lighting rig and accompanied on stage by their giant pipe-organ set piece , which is known to boston insiders as bertha because of its sheer size boston 's genre is considered by most to be hard rock and arena rock , while combining elements of progressive rock into its music boston founder , guitarist , and primary songwriter tom scholz 's blend of musical styles , ranging from classical to 1960s english pop , has resulted in a unique sound , most consistently realized on the first two albums ( boston and do n't look back ) the original track '' higher power '' , on the greatest hits album , exhibits a near neue deutsche härte and almost techno influence with its sequencer-sounding keyboards , a sound most fully realized on corporate americas title track delp , who was strongly influenced by the beatles , was well known for his extended vocal range , shown on hits such as '' more than a feeling '' ;
