in 1994 a research information note ( no 252 ) was published , written by john gibbs , clive brasier and joan webber who are still active in the field ; and in 2010 a pathology advisory note , as well as throughout the period a stream of more academic papers : notable results have been the observation that the progress of the disease through scotland has been quite slow , and that genetic engineering has been tried to improve the resistance of the english elm however , 'princeton ' has not proven resistant in europe , where the main vector of the disease is the larger elm bark beetle , scolytus scolytus , capable of introducing far more fungal spores into the tree ; many of the 50 trees planted by hrh charles , prince of wales , in 2006 at highgrove had died from dutch elm disease by 2011 ' '' super tree '' from northamptonshire helping to fight dutch elm disease and repopulate woodlands ' , northamptonchron.co.uk the foundation is currently running two elm programmes : the 'great british elm experiment ' and 'ulmus londinium ' , an elm programme for london – these use saplings cultivated through micropropagation from mature parent elms found growing in the british countryside : parent trees are monitored for disease , while saplings are offered free to schools and community groups , who are asked to monitor their trees ' progress on the foundation 's online elm map ; elms are available at a small price to others who do not qualify for a free tree ; in london , places with 'elm ' in their name are offered a sapling – in an attempt to find out why some elms have survived while others succumbed to dutch elm disease the largest surviving urban forest of elm trees in north america is believed to be in the city of winnipeg , where close to 200,000 elms remain & nbsp ; – at least double that of amsterdam , the '' elm city of europe '' in spain , for example , of around 5,000 native elms evaluated to 2013 , some 25 genotypes ( 0.5 % of those tested ) fall into this category ; and it is now hoped that the controlled crossing of the best seven of these ( genetically and aesthetically ) will produce ulmus minor hybrids with effective 'field resistance ' and market appeal only 'columella ' was released during the lifetime of the dutch programme , in 1987 ; patents for the lutèce and vada clones were purchased by the french institut national de la recherche agronomique ( inra ) , which subjected the trees to 20 years of field trials in the bois de vincennes , paris , before releasing them to commerce in 2002 and 2006 , respectively 58 the disease spread from new england westward and southward , almost completely destroying the famous elms in the '' elm city '' of new haven , connecticut , reaching the detroit area in 1950 , the chicago area by 1960 , and minneapolis by 1970 the provinces of alberta , manitoba , and saskatchewan all prohibit the pruning of elm trees during the middle of the year ( taking effect in april , and lasting through the end of september , july , and august respectively ) , which they deem to be the most active time of year for bark beetles the disease was isolated in the netherlands in 1921 by bea schwarz , a pioneering dutch phytopathologist , and this discovery would lend the disease its name brighton and hove council page on the city 's elm collection ( viewed 2 june 2010 ) empowered by the dutch elm disease ( local authorities ) ( amendment ) order 1988 , local authorities may order the destruction of any infected trees or timber , although in practice they usually do it themselves , successfully reducing the numbers of elm bark beetle scolytus spp in the us , when dutch elm disease spread away from the atlantic coast , control focused on controlling the bark beetle by using insecticides such as ddt and dieldrin , which were sprayed heavily across all parts of elm trees , usually twice a year in the spring and again at a lower concentration in the summer 'morfeo ' was released in 2011 ; it arose from a crossing of the dutch hybrid clone '405 ' ( female parent ) and the chenmou elm , the latter a small tree from the provinces of anhui and jiangsu in eastern china , the '405 ' clone is a crossing of an english u '' indications from annual rings a reference to the dark staining in an annual ring in infected elms confirm that dutch elm disease was certainly present in 1867 , '' he wrote , quoting contemporary accounts of diseased and dying elms , including this passage in richard jefferies ' 1883 book , nature near london : there is something wrong with elm trees however this method , developed in the netherlands , was considered too severe in america , where the principal disease vector is the bark beetle scolytus multistriatus , a far less effective vector than the larger beetle endemic to europe , scolytus scolytus , which is unknown in america the largest concentration of mature elm trees remaining in england is in brighton and hove , east sussex , where of the 30,000 elms in 1983 research on dutch elm disease in europe , ed about dutch trig® trials with the american elm have been very successful ; in a six-year experiment with the american elm in denver , co , annual dutch elm disease losses declined significantly after the first year from 7 percent to between 0.4 and 0.6 percent ; a greater and more rapid reduction in disease incidence than the accompanying tree sanitation and plant health care programs '' vaclav vetvička , trees and shrubs ( london 1985 ) sir thomas browne , writing in 1658 , noted in the garden of cyrus an elm disease that was spreading through english hedgerows , and described symptoms reminiscent of ded as the xylem ( one of the two types of vascular tissue produced by the vascular cambium , the other being the phloem ) delivers water and nutrients to the rest of the plant , these plugs prevent them from travelling up the trunk of the tree , starving the tree of water and nutrients , therefore , eventually killing it in italy , research is continuing at the istituto per la protezione delle piante , florence , to produce a range of disease-resistant trees adapted to the warmer mediterranean climate , using a variety of asiatic species crossed with the early dutch hybrid 'plantyn ' as a safeguard against any future mutation of the disease this method was further refined by the university of wisconsin team , which drilled holes in the branches to simulate natural infection by the bark beetles feeding in the twig crotches , but results from this method were found to exaggerate the genetic resistance of the host in the method devised by the usda , the inoculum is introduced to the cambium via a 2 & nbsp ; mm-diameter hole drilled through the bark in the lower third of the tree in england the conservation foundation has begun propagating , distributing and planting clones of surviving indigenous elms , including field elms ( but not the highly susceptible english elm ) , as part of a scheme to return elms to city and countryside recent research has indicated it is the presence of certain organic compounds , such as triterpenes and sterols , which serves to make the tree bark unattractive to the beetle species that spread the disease ded was first reported in the united states in 1928 , with the beetles believed to have arrived in a shipment of logs from the netherlands destined for use as veneer in the ohio furniture industry rubra resulted in the release of 'coolshade ' and 'rosehill ' in the 1940s and 50s ; the species last featured in hybridization as the female parent of 'repura ' and 'revera ' , both patented in 1993 , although neither has yet appeared in commerce a clear example would be the european white elm ulmus laevis which , while having little or no genetic resistance to ded , synthesizes a triterpene , alnulin , rendering the bark distasteful to the vector beetles , obliging them to look further afield for more suitable elms ded is spread in north america by three species of bark beetles ( family : curculionidae , subfamily : scolytinae ) : the native elm bark beetle , hylurgopinus rufipes in 2005 , amsterdam was declared the '' elm city of europe '' : the city ’ s streets and canals are lined with at least 75,000 elms , including several generations of research-elms ( see below : resistant trees ) in spain , the escuela técnica superior de ingenieros de montes , universidad politecnica de madrid , charged with discovering disease-resistant elms for use in forestry , has raised and patented seven cultivars of the field elm ulmus minor , although two have subsequently been found to have siberian elm u alberta and british columbia are the only provinces that are currently free of dutch elm disease , although , in an isolated case , an elm tree in wainwright , alberta , was found diseased in june 1998 and was immediately destroyed in toronto , 80 % of the elm trees have been lost to dutch elm disease ; many more fell victim in ottawa , montreal and other cities during the 1970s and 1980s their survival is owing to the isolation of the area , between the english channel and the south downs , and the assiduous efforts of local authorities to identify and remove infected sections of trees immediately when they show symptoms of the disease sanitary felling has also , to date , preserved most of the 250,000 elms on the isle of man , isle of man elms , geocomputation.org where average temperature and wind speed inhibit the activity of the beetles , which need a temperature of at least 20 degrees to fly and a wind speed of less than five metres per second resistantelms.co.uk dutchelmdisease.org elm recovery project – guelph university , canada dutch elm disease at government of british columbia dutch elm disease – gallery of pests species profile – dutch elm disease ( ophiostoma ulmi and ophiostoma novo-ulmi ) , national invasive species information center , united states national agricultural library in its early years , it was generally thought by observers that pesticides did slow the spread of the disease across the united states but as early as 1947 , concern was raised that many bird species were killed in large numbers by ingesting poisoned invertebrates although 'american liberty ' is marketed as a single variety , nurseries selling the '' liberty elm '' actually distribute the six cultivars at random and thus , unfortunately , the resistance of any particular tree can not be known the differences in method and inocula possibly explain why the american cultivar 'princeton ' , displaying high resistance in the usa , has often succumbed to dutch elm disease in europe the united states national park service ( nps ) used a number of methods to control the epidemic , including sanitation , pruning , injecting trees with fungicide and replanting with ded-resistant american elm cultivars ( see ulmus americana cultivars ) ophiostoma novo-ulmi , an extremely virulent species from japan which was first described in europe and north america in the 1940s and has devastated elms in both continents since the late 1960s glabra surviving in areas of high infectivity , prompting the royal botanic garden edinburgh to begin a programme of cloning of the trees and inoculation of their saplings with the fungus , with a view to determining innate resistance ( 2010 ) since the 1990s , a programme of antifungal injections of the most prominent 10,000 elms , and of sanitation felling , has reduced annual elm losses in the hague from 7 % to less than 1 % ( see below : preventive treatment ) another variable is the composition of the inoculum ; while an inoculum strength of 10 6 spores / & nbsp ; ml is standard in both continents , its composition reflects the different ophiostoma species , subspecies and hybrids endemic to the two continents although modern critics of carson have argued that the bird deaths were caused by other factors such as mercury poisoning in the soil , spraying against elm bark beetles declined very rapidly after 1962 , a trend aided by fungicides without dangerous side-effects being discovered for the first time after many years of research dutch trig is nontoxic , consisting of a suspension in distilled water of spores of a strain of the fungus verticillium albo-atrum that has lost much of its pathogenic capabilities , injected in the elm in spring it has been suggested that '' for thousands of years elms have flourished in natural balance with the scolytidae , combating occasional infections of dutch elm disease when first detected in the mid-20th century , the decline was attributed to the impact of forest-clearance by neolithic farmers , and of elm-coppicing for animal fodder , though the numbers of settlers could not have been large
