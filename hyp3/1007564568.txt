it is one of the most abundant organic polymers on earth , exceeded only by cellulose lignin is present in red algae , which suggest that the common ancestor of plants and red algae also synthesised lignin lignin fills the spaces in the cell wall between cellulose , hemicellulose , and pectin components , especially in vascular and support tissues : xylem tracheids , vessel elements and sclereid cells the polysaccharide components of plant cell walls are highly hydrophilic and thus permeable to water , whereas lignin is more hydrophobic lignin is present in all vascular plants , but not in bryophytes , supporting the idea that the original function of lignin was restricted to water transport it is covalently linked to hemicellulose and therefore cross-links different plant polysaccharides , conferring mechanical strength to the cell wall and by extension the plant as a whole its most commonly noted function is the support through strengthening of wood ( mainly composed of xylem cells and lignified sclerenchyma fibres ) in vascular plants only a fraction is used in a wide range of low volume applications where the form but not the quality is important mechanical , or high-yield pulp , which is used to make newsprint , still contains most of the lignin originally present in the wood given that it is the most prevalent biopolymer after cellulose , lignin has been investigated as a feedstock for biofuel production and can become a crucial plant extract in the development of a new class of biofuels both peroxidase and laccase enzymes are present in the plant cell walls , and it is not known whether one or both of these groups participates in the polymerisation because it is cross-linked with the other cell wall components , lignin minimizes the accessibility of cellulose and hemicellulose to microbial enzymes , leading to a reduced digestibility of biomass bacteria do not express any of the plant-type peroxidases ( lignin peroxidase , mn peroxidase , or versatile peroxidases ) , but three of the four classes of dyp are only found in bacteria in contrast to fungi , most bacterial enzymes involved in lignin degradation are intracellular , including two classes of dyp and most bacterial laccases bacterial degradation of lignin is particularly relevant in aquatic systems such as lakes , rivers , and streams , where inputs of terrestrial material ( e.g in addition to the presence or absence of light , several of environmental factors affect the biodegradability of lignin , including bacterial community composition , mineral associations , and redox state pyrolysis of lignin during the combustion of wood or charcoal production yields a range of products , of which the most characteristic ones are methoxy-substituted phenols of those , the most important are guaiacol and syringol and their derivatives in cooking , lignin in the form of hardwood is an important source of these two compounds , which impart the characteristic aroma and taste to smoked foods such as barbecue these compounds are produced by thermal breakdown of lignin in the wood used in the smokehouse increases in the ( ad/al ) value indicate an oxidative cleavage reaction has occurred on the alkyl lignin side chain which has been shown to be a step in the decay of wood by many white-rot and some soft rot fungi owing to the structural complexity of lignins , the spectra are poorly resolved and quantitation is challenging
