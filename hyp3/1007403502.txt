jones iii , the judge in the case , would ultimately rule that intelligent design is not scientific in his 139-page decision , citing behe 's testimony extensively as the basis for his findings : '' consider , to illustrate , that professor behe remarkably and unmistakably claims that the plausibility of the argument for id depends upon the extent to which one believes in the existence of god dover area school district/2 : context page 28 of 139 '' as no evidence in the record indicates that any other scientific proposition 's validity rests on belief in god , nor is the court aware of any such scientific propositions , professor behe 's assertion constitutes substantial evidence that in his view , as is commensurate with other prominent id leaders , id is a religious and not a scientific proposition in 2001 pennock responded that he had been careful to represent their views correctly , and that while several leaders of the intelligent design movement were young earth creationists , others including behe were '' old-earthers '' and '' creationists in the core sense of the term , namely , that they reject the scientific , evolutionary account of the origin of species and want to replace it with a form of special creation in 1996 , behe became a senior fellow of the discovery institute 's '' center for the renewal of science and culture '' ( later renamed the center for science and culture ) , an organization dedicated to promoting intelligent design in 2004 , behe published a paper with david snoke , in the scientific journal protein science that uses a simple mathematical model to simulate the rate of evolution of proteins by point mutation , behe & snoke 2004 which he states supports irreducible complexity , based on the calculation of the probability of mutations required for evolution to succeed dover area school district/4 : whether id is science page 68 of 139 '' what is more , defense experts concede that id is not a theory as that term is defined by the nas and admit that id is at best 'fringe science ' which has achieved no acceptance in the scientific community as to the identity of the intelligent designer , behe responds that if , deep in the woods , one were to come across a group of flowers that clearly spelled out the name '' lehigh '' , one would have no doubt that the pattern was the result of intelligent design the book was reviewed , by prominent scientists in the new york times , the new republic , the globe and mail , science , and nature who were highly critical of the work noting that behe appears to accept almost all of evolutionary theory , barring random mutation , which is replaced with guided mutation at the hand of an unnamed designer 227â€“229 behe gives the following reply to the assertion that intelligent design is '' unfalsifiable '' or that he is attempting to avoid the possibility of testing the positive claims of intelligent design : '' in fact , my argument for intelligent design is open to direct experimental rebuttal dover area school district/4 : whether id is science page 74 of 139 '' professor behe has applied the concept of irreducible complexity to only a few select systems : ( 1 ) the bacterial flagellum ; ( 2 ) the blood-clotting cascade ; and ( 3 ) the immune system dover area school district/4 : whether id is science page 70 of 139 '' we therefore find that professor behe 's claim for irreducible complexity has been refuted in peer-reviewed research papers and has been rejected by the scientific community at large dover area school district , the first direct challenge brought in united states federal courts to an attempt to mandate the teaching of intelligent design on first amendment grounds , behe was called as a primary witness for the defense and asked to support the idea that intelligent design was legitimate science behe 's refusal to identify the nature of any proposed intelligent designer frustrates scientists , who see it as a move to avoid any possibility of testing the positive claims of id while allowing him and the intelligent design movement to distance themselves from some of the more overtly religiously motivated critics of evolution they then concluded with examples of adaptation that contradict the book 's conclusions and expound on the flaws of irreducible complexity , adding that '' why evolution by natural selection is difficult for so many to accept is beyond the scope of this review ; however , it is not for a lack of evidence dover area school district/4 : whether id is science page 79 of 139 '' id proponents primarily argue for design through negative arguments against evolution , as illustrated by professor behe 's argument that 'irreducibly complex ' systems can not be produced through darwinian , or any natural , mechanisms see for example : hermodson 2005 lynch 2005 some of the critics have also noted that the discovery institute continues to claim the paper as 'published evidence for design , ' despite its offering no design theory nor attempting to model the design process , and therefore not providing an alternative to random chance in 2007 , behe 's book the edge of evolution was published arguing that while evolution can produce changes within species , there is a limit to the ability of evolution to generate diversity , and this limit ( the '' edge of evolution '' ) is somewhere between species and orders '' to this , these responses have been made : '' behe 's claim that intelligent design would be 'disproven ' is not correct for the simple fact that no legitimate test of the intelligent design theory has been provided in his example , the point at which darwinian evolution would no longer be an efficacious agent of creative biological change , arguing that purposeful design plays a major role in the development of biological complexity , through the mechanism of producing '' non-random mutations '' , which are then subjected to the sculpting hand of natural selection dover area school district/4 : whether id is science page 78 of 139 '' with id , proponents assert that they refuse to propose hypotheses on the designer 's identity , do not propose a mechanism , and the designer , he/she/it/they , has never been seen to this aim , he examines the genetic changes undergone by the malaria plasmodium genome and the human genome in response to each other 's biological defenses , and identifies that '' the situation resembles trench warfare , not an arms race '' , by considering the hemoglobin-destroying , protein pump-compromising as a '' war by attrition '' in addition , professor behe agreed that for the design of human artifacts , we know the designer and its attributes and we have a baseline for human design that does not exist for design of biological systems yet here he is demanding that scientists do an actual experiment with actual bacteria , the numbers of which could not possibly be contained in a lab , on the evolution of a much more complex biochemical system that would almost certainly take longer to evolve than the whole of recorded human history 319 : '' i could n't have written about evolution without the generous tutoring of michael behe , david berlinski , and william dembski , all of whom are fabulous at translating complex ideas , unlike liberal arts types , who constantly force me to the dictionary to relearn the meaning of quotidian dover area school district/4 : whether id is science page 68 of 139 earlier during his direct testimony , behe had argued that a computer simulation of evolution he performed with snoke shows that evolution is not likely to produce certain complex biochemical systems although professor behe is adamant in his definition of irreducible complexity when he says a precursor 'missing a part is by definition nonfunctional , ' what he obviously means is that it will not function in the same way the system functions when all the parts are present dover area school district/4 : whether id is science page 71 of 139 '' professor behe 's concept of irreducible complexity depends on ignoring ways in which evolution is known to occur behe was forced to concede that '' there are no peer reviewed articles by anyone advocating for intelligent design supported by pertinent experiments or calculations which provide detailed rigorous accounts of how intelligent design of any biological system occurred '' and that his definition of 'theory ' as applied to intelligent design was so loose that astrology would also qualify however , professor behe excludes , by definition , the possibility that a precursor to the bacterial flagellum functioned not as a rotary motor , but in some other way , for example as a secretory system behe 's suggestion of an experiment involving active selection for mobility is quite irrelevant to testing an intelligent design theory since the causal conditions involve the experimenter , not the intelligent agent to which the theory refers however , the paper does not mention intelligent design nor irreducible complexity , which were removed , according to behe , at the behest of the reviewers dembski and others in the intelligent design movement , behe accepts the common descent of species , including that humans descended from other primates , although he states that common descent does not by itself explain the differences between species dover area school district/4 : whether id is science page 76 of 139 '' in fact , on cross-examination , professor behe was questioned concerning his 1996 claim that science would never find an evolutionary explanation for the immune system '' we therefore find that professor behe 's claim for irreducible complexity has been refuted in peer-reviewed research papers and has been rejected by the scientific community at large dover area school district testimony many of behe 's critics have pointed to these exchanges as examples they believe further undermine behe 's statements about irreducible complexity and intelligent design joshua swamidass , a harsh critique by jerry coyne in the washington post , and a scholarly rebuttal in evolution from gregory lang and amber rice , behe 's colleagues at lehigh university michael behe biography from lehigh university michael behe biography from the discovery institute michael behe biography from the access research network irreducible complexity and michael behe on intelligent design from the talkorigins archive under cross examination however , behe was forced to agree that '' the number of prokaryotes in 1 ton of soil are 7 orders of magnitude higher than the population it would take to produce the disulfide bond '' and that '' it 's entirely possible that something that could n't be produced in the lab in two years behe says he once fully accepted the scientific theory of evolution , but that after reading evolution : a theory in crisis ( 1985 ) , by michael denton , he came to question evolution '' behe has charged that his detractors are inconsistent : '' coyne 's conclusion that design is unfalsifiable , however , seems to be at odds with the arguments of other reviewers of my book
