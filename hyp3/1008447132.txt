the scottish enlightenment thinker , shows the idea that it is important to value and think well of yourself because it serves as a motivational function that enables people to explore their full potential the identification of self-esteem as a distinct psychological construct has its origins in the work of philosopher , psychologist , geologist , and anthropologist william james ( 1892 ) james identified multiple dimensions of the self , with two levels of hierarchy : processes of knowing ( called the ' i-self ' ) and the resulting knowledge about the self ( the 'me-self ' ) the observation about the self and storage of those observations by the i-self creates three types of knowledge , which collectively account for the me-self , according to james the material self consists of representations of the body and possessions and the spiritual self of descriptive representations and evaluative dispositions regarding the self in the mid-1960s , social psychologist morris rosenberg defined self-esteem as a feeling of self-worth and developed the rosenberg self-esteem scale ( rses ) , which became the most-widely used scale to measure self-esteem in the social sciences the concept of core self-evaluations as first examined by judge , locke , and durham ( 1997 ) , has since proven to have the ability to predict job satisfaction and job performance the underlying idea of the movement was that low self-esteem was the root of problems for individuals , making it the root of societal problems and dysfunctions a leading figure of the movement , psychologist nathaniel branden , stated : '' i can not think of a single psychological problem – from anxiety and depression , to fear of intimacy or of success , to spouse battery or child molestation – that is not traced back to the problem of low self-esteem '' concern about low self-esteem and its many presumed negative consequences led california assemblyman john vasconcellos to work to set up and fund the task force on self-esteem and personal and social responsibility in california in 1986 the task force disbanded in 1995 , and the national council for self-esteem and later the national association for self-esteem ( nase ) was established , taking on the task force 's mission he described two different forms of '' esteem '' : the need for respect from others in the form of recognition , success , and admiration , and the need for self-respect in the form of self-love , self-confidence , skill , or aptitude maslow also states that the healthiest expression of self-esteem '' is the one which manifests in the respect we deserve for others , more than renown , fame , and flattery '' carl rogers ( 1902–1987 ) , an advocate of humanistic psychology , theorized the origin of many people 's problems to be that they despise themselves and consider themselves worthless and incapable of being loved indeed , the concept of self-esteem is approached since then in humanistic psychology as an inalienable right for every person , summarized in the following sentence : one of the most widely used instruments , the rosenberg self-esteem scale ( rses ) is a 10-item self-esteem scale score that requires participants to indicate their level of agreement with a series of statements about themselves for example , if a woman was given the self-relevant stimuli of female and mother , psychologists would measure how quickly she identified the negative word , evil , or the positive word , kind in the early years of a child 's life , parents have a significant influence on self-esteem and can be considered the main source of positive and negative experiences a child will have experiences that contribute to low self-esteem include being harshly criticized , being physically , sexually or emotionally abused , being ignored , ridiculed or teased or being expected to be '' perfect '' all the time multiple cohort studies show that there is not a difference in the life-span trajectory of self-esteem between generations due to societal changes such as grade inflation in education or the presence of social media feelings of shame usually occur because of a situation where the social self is devalued , such as a socially evaluated poor performance a poor performance leads to higher responses of psychological states that indicate a threat to the social self namely a decrease in social self-esteem and an increase in shame moral judgment stages : individuals describe their real , ideal , and dreaded selves with stereotypical labels , such as '' nice '' or '' bad '' people with a healthy level of self-esteem : adapted from firmly believe in certain values and principles , and are ready to defend them even when finding opposition , feeling secure enough to modify them in light of experience a person can have high self-esteem and hold it confidently where they do not need reassurance from others to maintain their positive self-view , whereas others with defensive high self-esteem may still report positive self-evaluations on the rosenberg scale , as all high self-esteem individuals do ; however , their positive self-views are fragile and vulnerable to criticism the necessity of repeated praise can be associated with boastful , arrogant behavior or sometimes even aggressive and hostile feelings toward anyone who questions the individual 's self-worth , an example of threatened egotism the journal of educational psychology conducted a study in which they used a sample of 383 malaysian undergraduates participating in work integrated learning ( wil ) programs across five public universities to test the relationship between self-esteem and other psychological attributes such as self-efficacy and self-confidence individuals who score high on narcissism measures , robert raskin 's 40 item true or false test , would likely select true to such statements as '' if i ruled the world , it would be a much better place there is only a moderate correlation between narcissism and self-esteem ; that is to say that an individual can have high self-esteem but low narcissism or can be a conceited , obnoxious person and score high self-esteem and high narcissism distinguishes three states of self-esteem compared to the '' feats '' ( triumphs , honors , virtues ) and the '' anti-feats '' ( defeats , embarrassment , shame , etc they may be overwhelmed by defeat , or shame , or see themselves as such , and they name their '' anti-feat '' for example , if they consider that being over a certain age is an anti-feat , they define themselves with the name of their anti-feat , and say , '' i am old '' however , their self-esteem is also vulnerable to the perceived risk of an imminent anti-feat ( such as defeat , embarrassment , shame , discredit ) , consequently , they are often nervous and regularly use defense mechanisms although such individuals may outwardly exhibit great self-confidence , the underlying reality may be just the opposite : the apparent self-confidence is indicative of their heightened fear of anti-feats and the fragility of their self-esteem however , no type of self-esteem is indestructible , and due to certain situations or circumstances in life , one can fall from this level into any other state of self-esteem contingent self-esteem is derived from external sources , such as what others say , one 's success or failure , one 's competence , or relationship-contingent self-esteem however , because the pursuit of contingent self-esteem is based on receiving approval , it is doomed to fail , as no one receives constant approval , and disapproval often evokes depression belief that one is '' ontologically acceptable '' is to believe that one 's acceptability is '' the way things are without contingency '' the christian message , said harris , is not '' you can be ok , if '' ; it is '' you are accepted , unconditionally '' abraham maslow states that psychological health is not possible unless the essential core of the person is fundamentally accepted , loved and respected by others and by oneself understanding this is fundamental , and universally beneficial , since the development of positive self-esteem increases the capacity to treat other people with respect , benevolence and goodwill , thus favoring rich interpersonal relationships and avoiding destructive ones josé-vicente bonet claims that the importance of self-esteem is obvious as a lack of self-esteem is , he says , not a loss of esteem from others , but self-rejection freud also claimed that the depressive has suffered '' an extraordinary diminution in his self-regard , an impoverishment of his ego on a grand scale.he has lost his self-respect '' the yogyakarta principles , preamble and principles 11 the world health organization recommends in '' preventing suicide '' , published in 2000 , that strengthening students ' self-esteem is important to protect children and adolescents against mental distress and despondency , enabling them to cope adequately with difficult and stressful life situations from the late 1970s to the early 1990s many americans assumed as a matter of course that students ' self-esteem acted as a critical factor in the grades that they earned in school , in their relationships with their peers , and in their later success in life impact publishers although acknowledging the human propensity and tendency to ego rating as innate , he has critiqued the philosophy of self-esteem as unrealistic , illogical and self- and socially destructive – often doing more harm than good also see nathaniel branden , how to raise your self-esteem : the proven action-oriented approach to greater self-respect and self-confidence ( random house , 1988 ) , 9 for a person whose '' self-esteem is contingent '' , success is '' not extra sweet '' , but '' failure is extra bitter '' life satisfaction , happiness , healthy behavioral practices , perceived efficacy , and academic success and adjustment have been associated with having high levels of self-esteem ( harter , 1987 ; huebner , 1991 ; lipschitz-elhawi & itzhaky , 2005 ; rumberger 1995 ; swenson & prelow , 2005 ; yarcheski & mahon , 1989 ) however , a common mistake is to think that self-love is necessarily equivalent to narcissism , as opposed for example to what erik erikson speaks of as '' a post-narcissistic love of the ego '' people with a healthy self-esteem accept and love themselves unconditionally , acknowledging both virtues and faults in the self , and yet , in spite of everything , is able to continue to love themselves in narcissists , by contrast , an '' uncertainty about their own worth gives rise to.a self-protective , but often totally spurious , aura of grandiosity '' & nbsp ; – producing the class '' of narcissists , or people with very high , but insecure , self-esteem '' narcissism can thus be seen as a symptom of fundamentally low self-esteem , that is , lack of love towards oneself , but often accompanied by '' an immense increase in self-esteem '' based on '' the defense mechanism of denial by overcompensation instead , the narcissist emphasizes their virtues in the presence of others , just to try to convince themself that they are a valuable person and to try to stop feeling ashamed for their faults ; such '' people with unrealistically inflated self-views , which may be especially unstable and highly vulnerable to negative information ,
