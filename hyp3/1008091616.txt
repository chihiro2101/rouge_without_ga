thumb haverfordwest is a market town , the county town of pembrokeshire and an important road network hub between milford haven , pembroke dock , fishguard and st david 's as a result of its position at the tidal limit of the river cleddau at this point , a pair of sandstone ridges extending from east to west and separated by a deep , narrow valley , are cut through by the western cleddau from the foot of each spur , ancient bridges cross the river to prendergast : st martin 's bridge ( '' the old bridge '' ) and st mary 's bridge ( '' the new bridge '' , built in 1835 ) in addition to the four ancient parish churches , the remains of an augustinian priory are visible at the southern edge of the town g , the placenames of pembrokeshire , national library of wales , aberystwyth , 1992 , , vol

1980s , point to significant roman penetration to this westernmost part of wales the strategic position of haverfordwest with its defensive bluff overlooking the lowest fordable point on the western cleddau and accessible to sea traffic would have required a roman presence , probably modest in scale , from the 1st century ad to protect supplies to and from the coast , e.g in 1992 , aerial photography identified a roman road running to the west of carmarthen , past wiston to poyston cross , raising the possibility of roman fortlets at strategic river crossings at whitland and

withdrawing roman legions from britain granted civic status and celtic names to a number of pacified romano-british settlements , including southampton , chichester , old sarum near salisbury , carmarthen ( caerfyrddin ) and haverfordwest ( caer alun ) the ecclesiastical centre of the area ( perhaps the seat of a bishop in the age of the saints ) was probably one of the several churches of

normans ' protection from the welsh warlords it is recorded that the constable of the castle in 1207 was itohert , son of richard tancard , possibly a descendant of the first tancred the flemish presence , reputed to result from floods in the low countries , was more likely to have consisted initially of flemish mercenaries originally in the invading army of william the conqueror , who in reward for their part in william 's victory were granted lands in parts of northern britain , and in wales in the gower , and geraldus cambrensis recorded their presence in the hundred of roose in pembrokeshire a fleming , wizo , who died in 1130 founded at wiston a motte and bailey fortification , the forerunner of the stone castle , for protection against the welsh warlords : the flemings

the abolition of the borough in 1974 in 1405 , the town was burned by the french allies of owain glyndwr , although in its early history haverfordwest suffered less than most towns in wales from such depredations pembrokeshire county council conducted an extensive review of community boundaries in 2007 which made a number of submissions to the boundary commission for wales one area of contention concerned the status of the village of merlin 's bridge which continues to have its own community council despite its close proximity to haverfordwest and a degree of community over-spill as such the conurbation of haverfordwest and merlin 's bridge is the most populous urban area in pembrokeshire though haverfordwest 's community boundaries mean it is only the second most populous settlement in the county after milford haven the development of the riverside shopping centre in withybush on the outskirts of the town includes marks & spencer in 2010 and debenham 's in 2013 concerns about the relative decline of the historic town centre compared to the growth of the retail centre at withybush led to welsh historian john davies expressing his concern that haverfordwest is becoming '' a
