top-level carnivores ( most salmon species ) depend on fish feed of which a portion is usually derived from wild-caught fish ( anchovies , menhaden , etc the f3 challenge ( fish-free feed challenge ) , as explained by a report from wired in february 2017 , '' is a race to sell 100,000 metric tons of fish food , without the fish '' not only do the feeds for carnivorous fish , like certain salmon species , remain controversial due to the containment of wild caught fish like anchovies , but they are not helping the health of the fish , as is the case in norway , conducted a study in which cardiomyopathy syndrome ( cms ) , a severe cardiac disease in atlantic salmon ( salmo salar ) , was investigated pertaining the effects of functional feeds with reduced lipid content and increased eicosapentaenoic acid levels in controlling cms in salmon after infection with piscine myocarditis virus ( pmcv ) aquaculturists feel that operating a rearing system above its design capacity or above the social density limit of the fish will result in decreased growth rate and increased feed conversion ratio ( kg dry feed/kg of fish produced ) , which results in increased cost and risk of health problems along with a decrease in profits sea lice are ectoparasites which feed on mucus , blood , and skin , and migrate and latch onto the skin of wild salmon during free-swimming , planktonic nauplii and copepodid larval stages , which can persist for several days large numbers of highly populated , open-net salmon farms can create exceptionally large concentrations of sea lice ; when exposed in river estuaries containing large numbers of open-net farms , many young wild salmon are infected , and do not survive as a result in scotland , official figures show that more than nine million fish were lost to disease , parasites , botched treatment attempts and other problems on fish farms between 2016 and 2019 ciwf trust report , '' in too deep – the welfare of intensively farmed fish '' ( 2002 ) additionally , other common drugs used in salmonid fish farms in north america and europe include anesthetic , chemotherapeutic , and anthelmintic agents however , being in an ocean environment , the transfer of disease organisms from the wild fish to the aquaculture fish is an ever-present risk aquaculture not only impact the fish on the farm , but it also involves environmental interactions with other species , which in return are attracted or repelled by the farms mobile fauna , such as crustaceans , fish , birds , and marine mammals , interact with the process of aquaculture , but the long-term or ecological effects as a result of these interactions is still unknown the interactions that wild organisms have with aquaculture may have implications on the management of fisheries species and the ecosystem in relation to how the fish farms are structured and organized other potential problems faced by aquaculturists are the obtaining of various permits and water-use rights , profitability , concerns about invasive species and genetic engineering depending on what species are involved , and interaction with the united nations convention on the law of the sea the concerns and critiques of cultivating this gmo fish in aquaculture are that the fish will escape and interact with other fish ultimately leading to the reproduction with other fishes however , the fda , has determined that while net pens would not be the most appropriate to prevent escapes , that raising the salmon in panama waters would result effective in the prevention of escape because the water conditions there would fail to support long-term survival of the salmon in the case that they escaped the marine stewardship council has established an eco label to distinguish between farmed and wild-caught salmon , while the rspca has established the freedom food label to indicate humane treatment of farmed salmon , as well as other food products , 2006 ) both methods reduce the amount of nitrate in the water , and can potentially eliminate the need for water exchanges , closing the aquaculture system from the environment the amount of interaction between the aquaculture system and the environment can be measured through the cumulative feed burden ( cfb kg/m3 ) , which measures the amount of feed that goes into the ras relative to the amount of water and waste discharged however , because of its high capital and operating costs , ras has generally been restricted to practices such as broodstock maturation , larval rearing , fingerling production , research animal production , specific pathogen-free animal production , and caviar and ornamental fish production although the use of ras for other species is considered by many aquaculturalists to be currently impractical , some limited successful implementation of ras has occurred with high-value product such as barramundi , sturgeon , and live tilapia in the us , eels and catfish in the netherlands , trout in denmark and salmon is planned in scotland merrit , mike ( 13 january 2013 ) sea-change as farm grows fish on land the scotsman , retrieved 22 january 2013 and canada håstein of the national veterinary institute , '' different methods for slaughter of fish are in place and it is no doubt that many of them may be considered as appalling from an animal welfare point of view ice baths or chilling of farmed fish on ice or submerged in near-freezing water is used to dampen muscle movements by the fish and to delay the onset of post-death decay proper stunning renders the fish unconscious immediately and for a sufficient period of time such that the fish is killed in the slaughter process ( e.g file:2019-03-16 01 aquaculture in chile.jpg fish farming in the fjords of southern chile file : fish-farms-vietnam.jpg houseboat rafts with cages under for rearing fish near mỹ tho , vietnam file : fish-farming-vietnam.jpg transport boats moored at fish processing plant , mỹ tho file : zapotec fish farm in ixtlan oaxaca.png communal zapotec fish farm in ixtlán de juárez , mexico file : fish farm skardu.jpg fish farming traditionally takes place in purpose-built tanks in the skardu region in northern pakistan
