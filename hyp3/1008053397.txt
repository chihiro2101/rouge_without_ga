'' switch hitter '' is the most common phenomenon , and is highly prized because a batter usually has a higher statistical chance of successfully hitting the baseball when it is thrown by an opposite-handed pitcher against the cincinnati reds in the ninth inning , harris ( then a member of the montreal expos ) retired reggie sanders pitching right-handed , then switched to his left hand for the next two hitters , hal morris and ed taubensee , who both batted left-handed venditte became the 21st century 's first switch pitcher in the major leagues with his debut on june 5 , 2015 against the boston red sox , pitching two innings , allowing only one hit and recording five outs right-handed and one out left-handed mike conley shoots left-handed , but has preferred to shoot floaters right handed , as he does everything else right-handed off the court , ben simmons and luke kennard are also natural right-handers shooting left-handed brooklyn nets center deandre jordan who is left-handed , shoots with his left hand but has been known to dunk with his right hand , spin clockwise in his 360 dunks , and shoot right handed hook shots more accurately and from further out larry bird , lebron james , paul millsap , russell westbrook , danny ainge and gary payton shoot right-handed , but do almost everything left-handed off the courts , but bird once had a game in which he only shot left-handed running hook shots , cross passes and layups in martial arts fighters may choose to face their opponent with either the left shoulder forward in a right-handed stance ( '' orthodox '' ) or the right shoulder forward in a left-handed stance ( '' south-paw '' ) , thus a degree of cross dominance is useful originally , he only bowled with his right hand , but since he does everything else with his left hand , he was taught to bowl left handed as well , but needs to signal to the umpire when he switches hands when bowling to allow for the field to change in cue sports , players can reach farther across the table if they are able to play with either hand , since the cue must either be placed on the left or the right side of the body is a rarity amongst the current ranks of top snooker professionals , in that he is able to play to world standard with either hand in figure skating , most skaters who are right-handed spin and jump to the left , and vice versa for left-handed individuals , but it also down to habit for ballerinas very few skaters have such an ability to perform jumps and spins in both directions , and it is now considered a '' difficult variation '' in spins under the isu judging system to rotate in the non-dominant direction nobody can perform a jump sequence ( because it requires change of edge , whereas a combo is maintained on the same edge ) from clockwise to anti-clockwise , or vice versa in association football , being able to kick with either foot provides more options for both passing and scoring , as well as the ability to play on either side of the pitch most of them were actually left-footed ( '' lefties '' ) or right-footed , but developed expertises on both sides of their main professional tool , which outlies the importance that relies on both lateralities improvement when training for sports such football , having thereby an advantage on becoming successful ambidextrous receivers can make one-handed catches with either hand ; linemen can hold their shoulders square and produce an equal amount of power with both arms ; and punters can handle a bad snap and roll out and punt with either leg , limiting the chance of a block for the most part , right-handed players shoot left and , likewise , most left-handed players shoot right as the player will often wield the stick one-handed players who learn the game in the united states will generally play with their stronger hand in the middle of the stick , thus putting more power into slapshots in floorball , like ice hockey , right-handed players shoot left and , likewise , most left-handed players shoot right as the player will often wield the stick one-handed in field lacrosse , which is more popular in the united states , it is extremely advantageous to be able to use both hands , as players can play on both sides of the field and are harder to defend against however , in box lacrosse , which is more popular in canada , players often only use their dominant hand , like in hockey this is because unlike sports , which have structured rules and common player preferences , traditional martial arts are intended for situations such as self-defense , in which a wider array of physical challenges may occur some arts and schools practice all or most techniques and movements with both sides , while others emphasize that some techniques should only be trained on the right or the left ( though both sides tend to eventually receive nearly equal attention ) some of these arts rely on the tendency of right-handed people to move differently with the left side than with the right , and attempt to take advantage of this for instance , most weapons in ancient china were wielded primarily with the right hand and on the right side ; this habit has carried on to the practice of those weapons in modern times as an example , in xing yi quan , most schools that teach spear-fighting only practice on the right side , although much of the rest of the art is ambidextrous in practice due to a physical advantage on the space of time needed when matching the ball with the racket simultaneously with tagging the opponent 's movement , being laterality-crossed on eyedness with handedness may be a decisive factor for outstanding performance , since the hand which strikes the ball can do it while the overriding eye , matching with this hand , can be tagging the opponent 's movement-decisions cheong-eui kim is a truly ambidextrous player with no backhand , and can serve left-handed as well as right-handed some table tennis players have used their ability to hit with their non-dominant hand to return balls out of reach of their dominant hand 's backhand , most notably timo boll , a former world 1 player although it is quite uncommon , in badminton , ambidextrous players are able to switch the racquet between their hands , often to get to the awkward backhand corner quickly in rugby league and rugby union being ambidextrous is an advantage when it comes to passing the ball between teammates as well as being able to use both feet by the halves is an advantage in gaining field position by kicking the ball ahead jonny wilkinson is a prime example of a union player who is good at kicking with both feet , he is left handed and normally place kicks using his left , but he dropped the goal that won the rugby world cup in 2003 with his right in drum and bugle corps ( and drum and bell corps ) , snare drummers , quads ( tenors ) , and bass drummers need to be somewhat ambidextrous since they have to abide by what the composer/arranger has written , they have to learn to play evenly in terms of dynamics and speed with their right and left hands former beatles member paul mccartney is left-handed ( guitar and bass guitar ) and played left handed when performing ( as can be seen in many photos and videos throughout his musical career ) with respect to tools , ambidextrous may be used to mean that the tool may be used equally well with either hand ; an '' ambidextrous knife '' refers to the opening mechanism and locking mechanism on a folding knife it can also mean that the tool can be interchanged between left and right in some other way , such as an '' ambidextrous headset , '' which can be worn on either the left or right ear as an opposite example , some scissors are made specifically for use in one hand , and will not cut properly if used in the other hand ambidextrous firearms allows for an identical manual of arms regardless of which hand is being used as primary , which streamlines training ( eliminates need to have separate training drill for left handed shooting ) a degree of ambidexterity is required in surgery because surgeons must be able to tie with their left and right hands in either single or double knots this is usually due to factors like the positioning of the surgeon , whether they have an assistant and the angle required to throw and secure the knot ambidexterity is also useful after surgery on a dominant hand or arm , as it allows the patient to use their non-dominant hand with equal facility as the limb which is recovering from surgery
