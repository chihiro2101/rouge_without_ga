thus the moderating power was a monarch , a type of judge , who was not part of government , but served as a neutral power to the government , the executive power was vested in the ministers that the monarch appointed and they were , collectively , the head of government , the representative powers were a separation of the monstesquieu 's legislative power , with the representative power of opinion being an elected body to represent the opinion of the citizenry and the representative power of tradition was a hereditary house of peers and the judiciary was similar to the montesquieu 's judicial power in making this clear theoretical distinction between the powers of the king ( as head of state ) and the ministers ( as executive ) , constant was responding to the political reality which had become apparent in britain for more than a century : that is , the ministers , and not the king , are responsible actors , and the king '' reigns but does not rule '' indeed , the french constitution ( or charter ) of 1830 could be seen as a practical implementation of many of constant 's ideas : a hereditary monarchy existing alongside an elected chamber of deputies and a senatorial chamber of peers , with the executive power vested in responsible ministers he would have many powers , including the power to make judicial appointments , to dissolve the chamber and call new elections , to appoint the peers , and to dismiss ministers – but he would not be able to govern , make policy , or direct the administration , since that would be the task of the responsible ministers secondly , constant developed a new theory of constitutional monarchy , in which royal power was intended to be a neutral power , protecting , balancing and restraining the excesses of the other active powers ( the executive , legislature , and judiciary ) elsewhere ( for example , the 1848 '' statuto albertino '' of the kingdom of sardinia , which later became the basis of the italian constitution from 1861 ) the executive power was notionally vested in the king , but was exercised only by the responsible ministers the importance of constant 's writings on the liberty of the ancients and of that of his time has dominated understanding of his work , as has his critique of the french revolution in 1817 , the year when madame de staĕl died , he was back in paris , and was elected to the chamber of deputies , the lower legislative house of the restoration-era government this was an advance on the prevailing theory in the english-speaking world , which , following the opinion of william blackstone , the 18th-century english jurist , had regarded the king as head of the executive branch during the hundred days of napoleon , who had become more liberal , constant fled to the vendée , but returned when he was invited several times to the tuileries to set up changes for the charter of 1815 by emile faguet ( in french ) the liberty of the ancients compared with that of the moderns ( 1816 ) principles of politics applicable to all governments lecture on ancient and modern liberty contains a readable version for contemporary students nicolle , 1814 , , , réflexions sur les constitutions , la distribution des pouvoirs et les garanties dans une monarchie constitutionnelle ( 1814 ) de l'esprit de conquête et d'usurpation dans leurs rapports avec la civilisation actuelle ( 1815 ) ( against napoleon bonaparte ) principes de politique applicables à tous les gouvernements représentatifs ( 1815 ) mémoires sur les cent-jours de la liberté de l'industrie ( 1818 ) cours de politique constitutionnelle ( 1818–1820 ) « de la liberté des anciens comparée à celle des modernes » ( famous speech delivered in 1819 ) commentaire sur l'ouvrage de filangieri ( 1822–1824 ) de la religion considérée dans sa source , ses formes et son développement ( 5 vols de la force du gouvernement actuel de la france et de la nécessité de s ' y rallier ( 1796 ) des réactions politiques ( 1797 ) des effets de la terreur ( 1797 ) principes de politique ( 1806 ) fragments d'un ouvrage abandonné sur la possibilité d'une constitution républicaine dans un grand pays ( published in 1991 by aubier , manuscript probably written between 1795 and 1810 ) benjamin constant , '' de l ’ esprit de conquête et de l ’ usurpation dans leur rapports avec la civilisation européenne '' , hanovre , londres et paris , hahn et h the love affair depicted in the finished version of the novel is thought to be based on constant 's affair with anna lindsay , who describes the affair in her correspondence ( published in the revue des deux mondes , december 1930 – january 1931 ) '' benjamin constant , the french revolution , and the origins of french romantic liberalism '' , french historical studies ;
