the most important arthropods that are involved in the process include carrion beetles , mites , the flesh-fly ( sarcophagidae ) and blow-fly ( calliphoridae ) , such as the lucilia ( fly ) seen in the summer in north america , the most important non-insect animals that are typically involved in the process include mammal and bird scavengers , such as coyotes , dogs , wolf , foxes , rats , crows and vultures five general stages are used to describe the process of decomposition in vertebrate animals : fresh , bloat , active decay , advanced decay , and dry/remains these two stages contribute to the chemical process of decomposition , which breaks down the main components of the body the small amount of oxygen remaining in the body is quickly depleted by cellular metabolism and aerobic organism naturally present in respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts , creating an ideal environment for the proliferation of anaerobic organisms these multiply , consuming the body 's carbohydrates , lipids , and proteins , to produce a variety of substances including propionic acid , lactic acid , methane , hydrogen sulfide , and ammonia the process of microbial proliferation within a body is referred to as putrefaction and leads to the second stage of decomposition , known as bloat in this stage , anaerobic metabolism takes place , leading to the accumulation of gases , such as hydrogen sulfide , carbon dioxide , methane , and nitrogen as the pressure of the gases within the body increases , fluids are forced to escape from natural orifices , such as the nose , mouth , and anus , and enter the surrounding environment if all soft tissue is removed from the cadaver , it is referred to as completely skeletonized , but if only portions of the bones are exposed , it is referred to as partially skeletonised a dead body that has been exposed to the open elements , such as water and air , will decompose more quickly and attract much more insect activity than a body that is buried or confined in special protective gear or artifacts this is due , in part , to the limited number of insects that can penetrate a coffin and the lower temperatures under the soil in roughly descending degrees of importance , they are : temperature ; the availability of oxygen ; prior embalming ; cause of death ; burial , depth of burial , and soil type ; access by scavengers ; trauma , including wounds and crushing blows ; humidity , or wetness ; rainfall ; body size and weight ; composition ; clothing ; the surface on which the body rests ; foods/objects inside the specimen 's digestive tract ( bacon compared to lettuce ) a basic guide for the effect of environment on decomposition is given as casper 's law ( or ratio ) : if all other factors are equal , then , when there is free access of air a body decomposes twice as fast as if immersed in water and eight times faster than if buried in the earth moisture helps the growth of microorganisms that decompose the organic matter , but too much moisture could lead to anaerobic conditions slowing down the decomposition process this is one reason given for the lack of human remains found in the wreckage of the titanic , even in parts of the ship considered inaccessible to scavengers under certain conditions ( normally cool , damp soil ) , bodies may undergo saponification and develop a waxy substance called adipocere , caused by the action of soil chemicals on the body 's proteins and fats in extremely dry or cold conditions , the normal process of decomposition is halted & nbsp ; – by either lack of moisture or temperature controls on bacterial and enzymatic action & nbsp ; – causing the body to be preserved as a mummy the chemicals used in embalming repel most insects and slow down bacterial putrefaction by either killing existing bacteria in or on the body themselves or by '' fixing '' cellular proteins , which means that they can not act as a nutrient source for subsequent bacterial infections notable viewable embalmed bodies include those of : eva perón of argentina , whose body was injected with paraffin was kept perfectly preserved for many years , and still is as far as is known ( her body is no longer on public display ) even when a body is decomposed , embalming treatment can still be achieved ( the arterial system decays more slowly ) but would not restore a natural appearance without extensive reconstruction and cosmetic work , and is largely used to control the foul odors due to decomposition various sciences study the decomposition of bodies under the general rubric of forensic science because the usual motive for such studies is to determine the time and cause of death for law purposes : forensic taphonomy specifically studies the processes of decomposition to apply the biological and chemical principles to forensic cases to determine post-mortem interval ( pmi ) , post-burial interval as well as to locate clandestine graves forensic entomology studies the insects and other vermin found in corpses ; the sequence in which they appear , the kinds of insects , and where they are found in their life cycle are clues that can shed light on the time of death , the length of a corpse 's exposure , and whether the corpse was moved forensic anthropology is the medico-legal branch of physical anthropology that studies skeletons and human remains , usually to seek clues as to the identity , age , sex , height and ethnicity of their former owner in smaller dead plants , this process is largely carried out by the soil invertebrate fauna , whereas in the larger plants , primarily parasitic life-forms such as insects and fungi play a major breakdown role and are not assisted by numerous detritivore species for instance , lignin is a component of wood , which is relatively resistant to decomposition and can in fact only be decomposed by certain fungi , such as the black-rot fungi warmth increases the speed of plant decay , by the same amount regardless of the composition of the plant in most grassland ecosystems , natural damage from fire , insects that feed on decaying matter , termites , grazing mammals , and the physical movement of animals through the grass are the primary agents of breakdown and nutrient cycling , while bacteria and fungi play the main roles in further decomposition the spoilage of meat occurs , if the meat is untreated , in a matter of hours or days and results in the meat becoming unappetizing , poisonous or infectious spoilage is caused by the practically unavoidable infection and subsequent decomposition of meat by bacteria and fungi , which are borne by the animal itself , by the people handling the meat , and by their implements the rate of decomposition is governed by three sets of factors—the physical environment ( temperature , moisture and soil properties ) , the quantity and quality of the dead material available to decomposers , and the nature of the microbial community itself the higher the water content of a soil , the lower the oxygen content and consequently , the lower the rate of decomposition
