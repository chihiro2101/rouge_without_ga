as the first second-generation battleship in the us navy , nevada has been described as '' revolutionary '' and '' as radical as was in her day '' by present-day historians at the time of the ship 's completion in 1916 , the new york times remarked that the new warship was '' the greatest battleship afloat '' because she was so much larger than other contemporary american battleships : its tonnage was nearly three times that of the obsolete 1890 pre-dreadnought , almost twice that of the 1904 battleship , and almost greater than that of one of the first american dreadnoughts , —built just seven years prior to nevada nevada was the first battleship in the us navy to have triple gun turrets , a single funnel , and an oil-fired steam power plant one of the main purposes of the great white fleet , which sailed around the world in 1907–1908 , was to prove to japan that the us navy could '' carry any naval conflict into japanese home waters '' possibly as a result of this , battleships after 1908 were mainly designed to '' steam 8,000 & nbsp ; miles at cruising speeds '' ; given the distance between san pedro , where the fleet would be based , and manila , where the fleet was expected to have to fight under war plan orange , was , endurance was obviously a major concern for the u.s also , oil allowed for the boiler-room crew to be reduced—the engineer on estimated that 100 firemen ( stokers ) and 112 coal passers could be adequately replaced by just 24 men , which would allow some crew 's quarters to be eliminated ; this would save weight and also reduce the amount of fresh water and provisions that the ship would have to carry in addition to all of this , nevada had maximum armor over critical areas , such as the magazines and engines , and none over less important places , even though previous battleships had armor of varying thickness depending on the importance of the area it was protecting as a result of all of these design modifications from previous battleships , nevada was the first of the us navy 's '' standard '' type battleships '' standards '' were characterized by the use of oil fuel , the '' all or nothing '' armor scheme , and the arrangement of the main armament in four triple or twin turrets without any turrets located in the middle of the ship nevada and her sister were fitted with different engines to compare the two , putting them 'head-to-head ' : oklahoma received older vertical triple expansion engines , which had proven more fuel-efficient and reliable than the direct drive turbines of some earlier battleships , while nevada received geared curtis steam turbines the contract went to fore river shipbuilding company on 22 january 1912 for a total of 5,895,000 ( not including the armor and armament ) , and the time of construction was originally to be 36 months nevada was launched on 11 july 1914 ; she was sponsored by miss eleanor anne seibert , niece of governor tasker oddie of nevada and a descendant of the first secretary of the navy , benjamin stoddert though her '' acceptance trials '' were interrupted on 5 november because of a gale and rough seas , they were continued on the 6th with a test of her fuel economy ; this consisted of a 24-hour run where nevada steamed at when all of the preliminaries were completed , nevada was commissioned on 11 march 1916 at the charlestown navy yard , and william sims was the first captain of the new ship , followed by joseph strauss on 30 december 1916 prior to the united states ' entry into world war i , she conducted many training cruises and underwent many exercises out of her base in norfolk , virginia , sailing as far south as the caribbean on these cruises the us entered the war in april 1917 , but nevada was not sent to the other side of the atlantic because of a shortage of fuel oil in britain along with and her sister , the three were nicknamed the '' bantry bay squadron '' ; officially , they were battleship division six ( batdiv 6 ) under the command of rear admiral thomas s for the rest of the war , the three ships operated from the bay , escorting the large and valuable convoys bound for the british isles to ensure no german heavy surface ships could slip past the british grand fleet and annihilate the merchant ships and their weak escorts of older cruisers dismukes in command , and in company with this time , nevada returned to south america as an escort to the steamer pan america with secretary of state charles evans hughes embarked ; they all attended the centennial of brazilian independence in rio de janeiro , celebrated from 5 to 11 september 1922 this demonstrated to those allies and japan that the us navy had the ability to conduct transpacific operations and meet the imperial japanese navy in their home waters , where both japanese and war plan orange expected the '' decisive battle '' to be fought , if it should come 92 additionally , many different adaptations and additions were made : her main guns ' elevation was increased to 30° ( which upped the range of the guns from to , anti-torpedo bulges were added , her 12 original yarrow boilers were replaced with 6 more efficient bureau express boilers in a new arrangement to accommodate those bulges , two catapults were added for three vought o2u corsair biplane spotter aircraft , eight /25 cal aa guns were added , a new superstructure was installed , and her 5 '' /51 caliber gun secondary battery was relocated above the hull in an arrangement similar to that of the however , because halsey could not afford to take the slow battleships with his fast carriers on his dash to reinforce wake island 's marine detachment with fighters and because it was pye 's turn to rest in port and the harbor was where it was considered safe , none of the battleships were sailing on that morning when the sun rose over nevada on the 7th , the ship 's band was playing '' morning colors '' ; but planes then appeared on the horizon and the attack on pearl harbor began the officer of the deck , ensign joe taussig ( son of the joseph taussig ) , had earlier that morning ordered a second boiler lit off , planning to switch the power load from one boiler to the other around 0800 for several days prior to the attack , all of the 14-inch-gun ( 356 & nbsp ; mm ) battleships had been replacing their standard-weight main battery projectiles with a new heavier projectile that offered greater penetration and a larger explosive charge in exchange for a slight decrease in range all of the older projectiles and powder charges had been removed from the magazines of nevada , and the crew had taken a break after loading the new projectiles in anticipation of loading the new powder charges on sunday during the invasion , nevada supported forces ashore from 6–17 june , and again on 25 june ; during this time , she employed her guns against shore defenses on the cherbourg peninsula , '' seeming to lean back as she hurled salvo after salvo at the shore batteries file : uss nevada ( bb-36 ) fires in support of normandy.jpg '' forward 14 '' /45 guns of uss nevada ( bb-36 ) fire on positions ashore , during the landings on '' utah '' beach , 6 june 1944 to support this , many ships were sent from the beaches of normandy to the mediterranean , including five battleships ( the united states ' nevada , , , the british , and the free french , three us heavy cruisers , and , and many destroyers and landing craft were transferred south nevada supported this operation from 15 august to 25 september 1944 , '' dueling '' with '' big willie '' : a heavily reinforced fortress with four 340 mm ( 13.4 in ) guns in two twin turrets these guns had been salvaged from the french battleship provence after the scuttling of the french fleet in toulon ; the guns had a range of nearly 19 nautical miles ( 35 & nbsp ; km ) and they commanded every approach to the port of toulon in addition , the three 14 '' /45 caliber guns ( 356 & nbsp ; mm ) of turret 1 were replaced with mark 8 guns formerly on and in the relining process at the time of pearl harbor ; these new guns were relined to mark 12 specifications until 30 june , she was stationed off okinawa ; she then departed to join the 3rd fleet from 10 july to 7 august , which allowed nevada to come within range of the japanese home islands during the closing days of the war , though she did not bombard them as a result , she was assigned to be a target ship in the first bikini atomic experiments ( operation crossroads ) of july 1946 file : uss nevada ( bb-36 ) operation crossroads target ship.jpg battleship uss nevada ( bb-36 ) painted in orange as target ship for the operation crossroads able nuclear weapons test file : crossroads able atomic bomb test target ship disposition plan , 13 may 1946 ( 80-g-702624 ) png operation crossroads , 1946 : disposition of the target ships at bikini atoll as planned for the '' able '' atomic bomb test of 1 july 1946 ( dated 13 may 1946 ) ships identified are : german cruiser prinz eugen , uss arkansas ( bb-33 ) , uss pensacola ( ca-24 ) , japanese cruiser sakawa , uss nevada ( bb-36 ) , uss independence ( cvl-22 ) , japanese battleship nagato , uss salt lake city ( ca-25 ) , uss new york ( bb-34 ) , uss saratoga ( cv-3 ) , and uss pennsylvania ( bb-38 ) archaeologists also documented the two tripod masts , portions of the bridge , sections of deck and superstructure , and one of four tanks ( possibly a m24 chafee or m26 pershing ) placed on the deck for the atomic bomb tests
