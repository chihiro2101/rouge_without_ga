as a catchphrase , the term was applied to a large , incoherently defined group , and was rejected by most of the writers to whom it was applied : see , for example , '' answer to a letter from joe '' by john wain ( essays on literature and ideas , 1963 ) look back in anger provided some of its audience with the hope that osborne 's work would revitalise the british theatre and enable it to act as a '' harbinger of the new left '' in the song '' where are they now '' from the 1973 album preservation act 1 by the kinks , the following lines appear : '' where have all the angry young men gone ? / barstow and osborne , waterhouse and sillitoe/ where on earth did they all go ? '' the playwright john osborne was the archetypal example , and his signature play look back in anger ( 1956 ) attracted attention to a style of drama contrasting strongly with the genteel and understated works of terence rattigan that had been in fashion throughout the late 1950s and into the 1960s , the '' angries '' often met at or were nurtured by the royal shakespeare company , and through this venue other such emerging playwrights as edward bond and wole soyinka were exposed to the aym movement directly in addition to being seen as archetypal , osborne was claimed to be one of the leading literary figures of the angry young men '' movement '' william cooper , the early-model angry young man , though cambridge-educated , was a '' provincial '' writer in his frankness and material and is included in this group these included kingsley amis , philip larkin and john wain , all of whom were also part of the poetic circle known as '' the movement '' the main issues that angry young men had were '' impatience with the status quo , refusal to be co-opted by a bankrupt society , an instinctive solidarity with the lower classes '' on television , their writings were often expressed in plays in anthology drama series such as armchair theatre ( itv , 1956–68 ) and the wednesday play ( bbc , 1964–70 ) ; this leads to a confusion with the kitchen sink drama category of the early 1960s
