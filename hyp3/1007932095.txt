the term certiorari ( pronounced , , or ) comes from the words used at the beginning of these writs when they were written in latin : certiorārī volumus '' we wish to be made certain '' in the united states , particularly in relation to applications to the supreme court of the united states for review of a lower court decision in roman law , certiorari was suggested in terms of reviewing a case—much as the term is applied today—although the term was also used in writing to indicate the need or duty to inform other parties of a court 's ruling in england and wales , and separately in ireland and later northern ireland , the court of king 's bench was tasked with the duty of supervising all lower courts , and had power to issue all writs necessary for the discharge of that duty ; the justices of that court appeared to have no discretion as to whether it was heard , as long as an application for a bill of certiorari met established criteria , as it arose from their duty of supervision in the courts of england and wales , the remedy of certiorari evolved into a general remedy for the correction of plain error , to bring decisions of an inferior court or tribunal or public authority before the superior court for review so that the court can determine whether to quash such decisions reflecting this evolution in usage as a remedy after judicial review nullifying a decision of a public body , in england and wales , orders or writs of certiorari were renamed '' quashing orders '' by the civil procedure ( modification of supreme court act 1981 ) order 2004 , civil procedure ( modification of supreme court act 1981 ) order 2004 , si 2004 no the parliament of india has the authority to give a similar certiorari power to any other court to enforce the fundamental rights , in addition to the certiorari power of the supreme court the judicature amendment act did not abolish certiorari and the other writs , but it was expected that as the legal profession adapted to the use of the new application for review , the writs would cease to be used the philippines has adapted the extraordinary writ of certiorari in civil actions under its rules of court , as the procedure to seek judicial review from the supreme court of the philippines explains : in the united states , certiorari is most often seen as the writ that the supreme court of the united states issues to a lower court to review the lower court 's judgment for legal error ( reversible error ) and review where no appeal is available as a matter of right a party who wants the supreme court to review a decision of a federal or state court files a '' petition for writ of certiorari '' in the supreme court the supreme court is generally careful to choose only cases over which the court has jurisdiction and which the court considers sufficiently important , such as cases involving deep constitutional questions , to merit the use of its limited resources , utilizing tools such as the cert pool conversely , the supreme court 's denial of a petition for a writ of certiorari is sometimes misunderstood as implying that the supreme court approves the decision of the lower court '' in particular , a denial of a writ of certiorari means that no binding precedent is created by the denial itself , and the lower court 's decision is treated as mandatory authority only within the geographical ( or in the case of the federal circuit , subject-specific ) jurisdiction of that court state court systems use the same terminology , but in others , writ of review , leave to appeal , or certification for appeal is used in place of writ of certiorari as the name for discretionary review of a lower court 's judgment a handful of states lack intermediate appellate courts ; in most of these , their supreme courts operate under a mandatory review regime , in which the supreme court must take all appeals in order to preserve the loser 's traditional right to one appeal ( except in criminal cases where the defendant was acquitted ) thus , since june 1927 , over 4,100 decisions of the texas courts of appeals have become valid binding precedent of the texas supreme court itself because the high court refused applications for writ of error rather than denying them and thereby signaled that it approved of their holdings as the law of the state while texas ' unique practice saved the state supreme court from having to hear relatively minor cases just to create uniform statewide precedents on those issues , it also makes for lengthy citations to the opinions of the courts of appeals , since the subsequent writ history of the case must always be noted ( e.g ) in order for the reader to determine at a glance whether the cited opinion is binding precedent only in the district of the court of appeals in which it was decided , or binding precedent for the entire state in the administrative law context , the common law writ of certiorari was historically used by lower courts in the united states for judicial review of decisions made by an administrative agency after an adversarial hearing in the federal courts , this use of certiorari has been abolished and replaced by a civil action under the administrative procedure act in a united states district court or in some circumstances a petition for review in a united states court of appeals
