there was also an advert in the journal for the show the post-impressionists of france fry later explained : '' for purposes of convenience , it was necessary to give these artists a name , and i chose , as being the vaguest and most non-committal , the name of post-impressionism rewald considered this a continuation of his 1946 study , history of impressionism , and pointed out that a '' subsequent volume dedicated to the second half of the post-impressionist period '' : rewald , john : post-impressionism : from van gogh to gauguin , revised edition : secker & warburg , london , 1978 , p he explored their relationships as well as the artistic circles they frequented ( or were in opposition to ) , including : neo-impressionism : ridiculed by contemporary art critics as well as artists as pointillism ; seurat and signac would have preferred other terms : divisionism for example cloisonnism : a short-lived term introduced in 1888 by the art critic édouard dujardin , was to promote the work of louis anquetin , and was later also applied to contemporary works of his friend émile bernard synthetism : another short-lived term coined in 1889 to distinguish recent works of gauguin and bernard from that of more traditional impressionists exhibiting with them at the café volpini furthermore , in his introduction to post-impressionism , rewald opted for a second volume featuring toulouse-lautrec , henri rousseau '' le douanier '' , les nabis and cézanne as well as the fauves , the young picasso and gauguin 's last trip to the south seas ; it was to expand the period covered at least into the first decade of the 20th century—yet this second volume remained unfinished local national traditions as well as individual settings therefore could stand side by side , and from the very beginning a broad variety of artists practicing some kind of symbolic imagery , ranged between extreme positions : the nabis for example united to find synthesis of tradition and brand new form , while others kept to traditional , more or less academic forms , when they were looking for fresh contents : symbolism is therefore often linked to fantastic , esoteric , erotic and other non-realist subject matter to meet the recent discussion , the connotations of the term 'post-impressionism ' were challenged again : alan bowness and his collaborators expanded the period covered forward to 1914 and the beginning of world war i , but limited their approach widely on the 1890s to france for bowness and his contributors as well as for rewald , 'cubism ' was an absolutely fresh start , and so cubism has been seen in france since the beginning , and later in england according to the present state of discussion , post-impressionism is a term best used within rewald 's definition in a strictly historical manner , concentrating on french art between 1886 and 1914 , and re-considering the altered positions of impressionist painters like claude monet , camille pissarro , auguste renoir , and others—as well as all new schools and movements at the turn of the century : from cloisonnism to cubism along with general art history information given about '' post-impressionism '' works , there are many museums that offer additional history , information and gallery works , both online and in house , that can help viewers understand a deeper meaning of '' post-impressionism '' in terms of fine art and traditional art applications file : les joueurs de cartes , par paul cézanne , metropolitan museum of art.jpg paul cézanne ( 1839–1906 ) file:1914 redon zyklop anagoria.jpg odilon redon ( 1840–1916 ) file : henri rousseau - le rêve - google art project.jpg henri rousseau ( 1844–1910 ) file : paul gauguin 128.jpg paul gauguin ( 1848–1903 ) file : vincent willem van gogh 132.jpg vincent van gogh ( 1853–1890 ) file : charles théophile angrand 001.jpg charles angrand ( 1854–1926 ) file : henri-edmond cross , 1908 , les cyprès à cagnes , oil on canvas , 81 x 100 cm , musée d'orsay , paris.jpg henri-edmond cross ( 1856–1910 ) file : maximilien luce - 'montmartre , de la rue cortot , vue vers saint-denis ' , oil on canvas painting , c '' post-impressionists '' , walter sickert 's review in the fortnightly review of the '' manet and the post-impressionists '' exhibition at the grafton galleries '' post-impressionism '' , roger fry 's lecture on the closing of the '' manet and the post-impressionists '' exhibition at the grafton galleries , as published in the fortnightly review georges seurat , 1859-1891 , a full text exhibition catalog from the metropolitan museum of art toulouse-lautrec in the metropolitan museum of art , a full text exhibition catalog from the metropolitan museum of art '' roger fry , walter sickert and post-impressionism at the grafton galleries '' , a reflection by prof
