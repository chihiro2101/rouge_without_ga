one estimate is a peak rate of over one hundred thousand meteors an hour , space.com the 1833 leonid meteor shower : a frightening flurry but another , done as the storm abated , estimated in excess of two hundred thousand meteors during the 9 hours of storm , leonid mac brief history of the leonid shower over the entire region of north america east of the rocky mountains he noted the shower was of short duration and was not seen in europe , and that the meteors radiated from a point in the constellation of leo and he speculated the meteors had originated from a cloud of particles in space this showed that the meteoroids are mostly behind and outside the path of the comet , but paths of the earth through the cloud of particles resulting in powerful storms were very near paths of nearly no activity because meteor shower particles are all traveling in parallel paths , and at the same velocity , they will all appear to an observer below to radiate away from a single point in the sky this '' fixed point '' slowly moves across the sky during the night due to the earth turning on its axis , the same reason the stars appear to slowly march across the sky '' when the moving radiant is at the highest point it will reach in the observer 's sky that night , the sun will be just clearing the eastern horizon for this reason , the best viewing time for a meteor shower is generally slightly before dawn — a compromise between the maximum number of meteors available for viewing , and the lightening sky which makes them harder to see meteor showers are named after the nearest constellation or bright star with a greek or roman letter assigned that is close to the radiant position at the peak of the shower , whereby the grammatical declension of the latin possessive form is replaced by '' id '' or '' ids '' the international astronomical union 's task group on meteor shower nomenclature and the iau 's meteor data center keep track of meteor shower nomenclature and which showers are established a meteor shower is the result of an interaction between a planet , such as earth , and streams of debris from a comet dust mote sized solids are orders of magnitude more common than those the size of sand grains , which , in turn , are similarly more common than those the size of pebbles , and so on the meteoroids spread out along the entire orbit of the comet to form a meteoroid stream , also known as a '' dust trail '' ( as opposed to a comet 's '' gas tail '' caused by the very small particles that are quickly blown away by solar radiation pressure ) the fragments tend to fall apart quickly into dust , sand , and pebbles , and spread out along the orbit of the comet to form a dense meteoroid stream , which subsequently evolves into earth 's path shortly after whipple predicted that dust particles travelled at low speeds relative to the comet , milos plavec was the first to offer the idea of a dust trail , when he calculated how meteoroids , once freed from the comet , would drift mostly in front of or behind the comet after completing one orbit for example , the orbits of some repeating comets , and meteoroids leaving them , are in resonant orbits with jupiter or one of the other large planets & nbsp ; – so many revolutions of one will equal another number of revolutions of the other when the meteoroids pass by earth , some are accelerated ( making wider orbits around the sun ) , others are decelerated ( making shorter orbits ) , resulting in gaps in the dust trail in the next return ( like opening a curtain , with grains piling up at the beginning and end of the gap ) the most visible meteor shower in most years are the perseids , which peak on 12 august of each year at over one meteor per minute as the moon is in the neighborhood of earth it can experience the same showers , but will have its own phenomena due to its lack of an atmosphere per se , such as vastly increasing its sodium tail for mars in particular , although these are different from the ones seen on earth because the different orbits of mars and earth relative to the orbits of comets the martian atmosphere has less than one percent of the density of earth 's at ground level , at their upper edges , where meteoroids strike , the two are more similar on march 7 , 2004 , the panoramic camera on mars exploration rover spirit recorded a streak which is now believed to have been caused by a meteor from a martian meteor shower associated with comet 114p/wiseman-skiff ) meteors or meteor showers have been discussed for most of the objects in the solar system with an atmosphere : mercury , venus , [ saturn 's moon titan , note also the huygens lander was studied for its meteoric entry and an observation campaign was attempted : an artificial meteor on titan ?
