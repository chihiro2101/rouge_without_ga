the first report of the use of an insect species to control an insect pest comes from '' nanfang caomu zhuang '' ( 南方草木狀 plants of the southern regions ) ( c the practice was later reported by ling biao lu yi ( late tang dynasty or early five dynasties ) , in ji le pian by zhuang jisu ( song dynasty ) , in the book of tree planting by yu zhen mu ( ming dynasty ) , in the book guangdong xing yu ( 17th century ) , lingnan by wu zhen fang ( qing dynasty ) , in nanyue miscellanies by li diao yuan , and others pages 3–11 in 1905 the usda initiated its first large-scale biological control program , sending entomologists to europe and japan to look for natural enemies of the gypsy moth , lymantria dispar dispar , and brown-tail moth , brown-tail , invasive pests of trees and shrubs as a result , nine parasitoids ( solitary wasps ) of the gypsy moth , seven of brown-tail moth , and two predators of both moths became established in the us between 1884 and 1908 , the first dominion entomologist , james fletcher , continued introductions of other parasitoids and pathogens for the control of pests in canada there are three basic biological pest control strategies : importation ( classical biological control ) , augmentation and conservation importation or classical biological control involves the introduction of a pest 's natural enemies to a new locale where they do not occur naturally to be most effective at controlling a pest , a biological control agent requires a colonizing ability which allows it to keep pace with changes to the habitat in space and time control is greatest if the agent has temporal persistence so that it can maintain its population even in the temporary absence of the target species , and if it is an opportunistic forager , enabling it to rapidly exploit a pest population control with the salvinia weevil ( cyrtobagous salviniae ) and the salvinia stem-borer moth ( samea multiplicalis ) is effective in warm climates , and in zimbabwe , a 99 % control of the weed was obtained over a two-year period the population of levuana iridescens , the levuana moth , a serious coconut pest in fiji , was brought under control by a classical biological control program in the 1920s in inoculative release , small numbers of the control agents are released at intervals to allow them to reproduce , in the hope of setting up longer-term control and thus keeping the pest down to a low level , constituting prevention rather than cure in inundative release , in contrast , large numbers are released in the hope of rapidly reducing a damaging pest population , correcting a problem that has already arisen augmentation can be effective , but is not guaranteed to work , and depends on the precise details of the interactions between each pest and control agent the conservation of existing natural enemies in an environment is the third method of biological pest control natural enemies are already adapted to the habitat and to the target pest , and their conservation can be simple and cost-effective , as when nectar-producing crop plants are grown in the borders of rice fields these provide nectar to support parasitoids and predators of planthopper pests and have been demonstrated to be so effective ( reducing pest densities by 10- or even 100-fold ) that farmers sprayed 70 % less insecticides and enjoyed yields boosted by 5 % providing a suitable habitat , such as a windbreak , hedgerow , or beetle bank where beneficial insects such as parasitoidal wasps can live and reproduce , can help ensure the survival of populations of natural enemies things as simple as leaving a layer of fallen leaves or mulch in place provides a suitable food source for worms and provides a shelter for insects , in turn being a food source for such beneficial mammals as hedgehogs and shrews the providing of artificial shelters in the form of wooden caskets , boxes or flowerpots is also sometimes undertaken , particularly in gardens , to make a cropped area more attractive to natural enemies in cotton production , the replacement of broad-spectrum insecticides with selective control measures such as bt cotton can create a more favorable environment for natural enemies of cotton pests due to reduced insecticide exposure risk reduced prey quality and abundance associated increased control from bt cotton can also indirectly decrease natural enemy populations in some cases , but the percentage of pests eaten or parasitized in bt and non-bt cotton are often similar ladybugs , and in particular their larvae which are active between may and july in the northern hemisphere , are voracious predators of aphids , and also consume mites , scale insects and small caterpillars although there are no quantitative studies of the effectiveness of barn owls for this purpose , they are known rodent predators that can be used in addition to or instead of cats ; they can be encouraged into an area with nest boxes in honduras , where the mosquito aedes aegypti was transmitting dengue fever and other infectious diseases , biological control was attempted by a community action plan ; copepods , baby turtles , and juvenile tilapia were added to the wells and tanks where the mosquito breeds and the mosquito larvae were eliminated even amongst arthropods usually thought of as obligate predators of animals ( especially other arthropods ) , flower food sources ( nectar and to a lesser degree pollen ) are often useful adjunct sources it had been noticed in one study that adult adalia bipunctata ( predator and common biocontrol of ephestia kuehniella ) could survive on flowers but never completed its life cycle , so a meta-analysis was done to find such an overall trend in previously published data , if it existed the most important groups are the ichneumonidae , which mainly use caterpillars as hosts ; braconidae , which attack caterpillars and a wide range of other insects including aphids ; chalcid wasps , which parasitize eggs and larvae of many insect species ; and tachinidae , which parasitize a wide range of insects including caterpillars , beetle adults and larvae , and hemiptera rearing facilities are usually a significant distance from where the agents are to be used in the field , and transporting the parasitoids from the point of production to the point of use can pose problems birds are a natural form of biological control , but the trichogramma minutum , a species of parasitic wasp , has been investigated as an alternative to more controversial chemical controls bacillus thuringiensis , a soil-dwelling bacterium , is the most widely applied species of bacteria used for biological control , with at least four sub-species used against lepidopteran ( moth , butterfly ) , coleopteran ( beetle ) and dipteran ( true fly ) insect pests the legume vine mucuna pruriens is used in the countries of benin and vietnam as a biological control for problematic imperata cylindrica grass : the vine is extremely vigorous and suppresses neighbouring plants by out-competing them for space and light the australian bush fly , musca vetustissima , is a major nuisance pest in australia , but native decomposers found in australia are not adapted to feeding on cow dung , which is where bush flies breed therefore , the australian dung beetle project ( 1965–1985 ) , led by george bornemissza of the commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation , released forty-nine species of dung beetle , to reduce the amount of dung and therefore also the potential breeding sites of the fly as part of the campaign against it , from 2003 american scientists and the chinese academy of forestry searched for its natural enemies in the wild , leading to the discovery of several parasitoid wasps , namely tetrastichus planipennisi , a gregarious larval endoparasitoid , oobius agrili , a solitary , parthenogenic egg parasitoid , and spathius agrili , a gregarious larval ectoparasitoid importing the natural enemies of these pests may seem a logical move but this may have unintended consequences ; regulations may be ineffective and there may be unanticipated effects on biodiversity , and the adoption of the techniques may prove challenging because of a lack of knowledge among farmers and growers biological control can affect biodiversity through predation , parasitism , pathogenicity , competition , or other attacks on non-target species for example , the cane toad ( rhinella marina ) was intentionally introduced to australia to control the cane beetle ( dermolepida albohirtum ) , and other pests of sugar cane also , when it is threatened or handled , the cane toad releases poison from parotoid glands on its shoulders ; native australian species such as goannas , tiger snakes , dingos and northern quolls that attempted to eat the toad were harmed or killed however , the weevil also attacks native thistles , harming such species as the endemic platte thistle ( cirsium neomexicanum ) by selecting larger plants ( which reduced the gene pool ) , reducing seed production and ultimately threatening the species ' survival however , the mongoose was diurnal , and the rats emerged at night ; the mongoose , therefore , preyed on the endemic birds of hawaii , especially their eggs , more often than it ate the rats , and now both rats and mongooses threaten the birds the sturdy and prolific eastern mosquitofish ( gambusia holbrooki ) is a native of the southeastern united states and was introduced around the world in the 1930s and '40s to feed on mosquito larvae and thus combat malaria however , it has thrived at the expense of local species , causing a decline of endemic fish and frogs through competition for food resources , as well as through eating their eggs and larvae however , pesticides have undesired effects , including the development of resistance among pests , and the destruction of natural enemies ; these may in turn enable outbreaks of pests of other species than the ones originally targeted , and on crops at a distance from those treated with pesticides one method of increasing grower adoption of biocontrol methods involves letting them learn by doing , for example showing them simple field experiments , enabling them to observe the live predation of pests , or demonstrations of parasitised pests in the philippines , early-season sprays against leaf folder caterpillars were common practice , but growers were asked to follow a 'rule of thumb ' of not spraying against leaf folders for the first 30 days after transplanting ; participation in this resulted in a reduction of insecticide use by 1/3 and a change in grower perception of insecticide use
