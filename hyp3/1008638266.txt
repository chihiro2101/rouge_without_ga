the working principle involves the acceleration of an electrically conductive fluid ( which can be a liquid or an ionized gas called a plasma ) by the lorentz force , resulting from the cross product of an electric current ( motion of charge carriers accelerated by an electric field applied between two electrodes ) with a perpendicular magnetic field this is the same working principle as an electric motor ( more exactly a linear motor ) except that in an mhd drive , the solid moving rotor is replaced by the fluid acting directly as the propellant as with all electromagnetic devices , an mhd accelerator is reversible : if the ambient working fluid is moving relatively to the magnetic field , charge separation induces an voltage that can be harnessed with electrodes : the device then acts as a power source with no moving parts , transforming the kinetic energy of the incoming fluid into electricity , called an mhd generator as the lorentz force in an mhd converter does not act on a single isolated charged particle nor on electrons in a solid electrical wire , but on a continuous charge density in motion , it is a '' volumetric '' ( body ) force , a force per unit volume : : \mathbf\ , \ ! where f is the force density ( force per unit volume ) , ρ the charge density ( charge per unit volume ) , e the electric field , j the current density ( current per unit area ) and b the magnetic field both systems can put the working fluid in motion according to two main designs : internal flow when the fluid is accelerated within and propelled back out of a nozzle of tubular or ring-shaped cross-section , the mhd interaction being concentrated within the pipe ( similarly to rocket or jet engines ) as low-pressure air is naturally ionized at such very high velocities and altitude , it was thought to use the effect of a magnetic field produced by an electromagnet to replace thermal ablative shields by a '' magnetic shield '' the current combines with the magnetic field to give lorentz forces that oppose the flow and detach the bow shock wave further ahead of the vehicle , lowering the heat flux which is due to the brutal recompression of air behind the stagnation point it is a field of magnetohydrodynamics also called magnetogasdynamics , magnetoaerodynamics or magnetoplasma aerodynamics , as the working fluid is the air ( a gas instead of a liquid ) ionized to become electrically conductive ( a plasma ) air ionization is achieved at high altitude ( electrical conductivity of air increases as atmospheric pressure reduces according to paschen 's law ) using various techniques : high voltage electric arc , rf ( microwaves ) electromagnetic glow discharge , laser , e-beam or betatron , radioactive source… with or without seeding of low ionization energy alkali substances ( like caesium ) into the flow mhd propulsion has been considered as the main propulsion system for both marine and space ships since there is no need to produce lift to counter the gravity of earth in water ( due to buoyancy ) nor in space ( due to weightlessness ) , which is ruled out in the case of flight in the atmosphere nonetheless , considering the current problem of the electric power solved ( for example with the availability of a still missing multi-megawatt compact fusion power ) , one could imagine future aircraft of a new kind silently powered by mhd accelerators , able to ionize and direct enough air downward to lift several tonnes as external flow systems can control the flow over the whole wetted area , limiting thermal issues at high speeds , ambient air would be ionized and radially accelerated by lorentz forces around an axisymmetric body ( shaped as a cylinder , a cone , a sphere… ) , the entire airframe being the engine such concepts of flying mhd disks have been developed in the peer review literature from the mid 1970s mainly by physicists leik myrabo with the lightcraft , and subrata roy with the wingless electromagnetic air vehicle ( weav ) all charged species within the plasma , from positive and negative ions to free electrons , as well as neutral atoms by the effect of collisions , are accelerated in the same direction by the lorentz '' body '' force , which results from the combination of a magnetic field with an orthogonal electric field ( hence the name of '' cross-field accelerator '' ) , these fields not being in the direction of the acceleration in the ben bova novel the precipice , the ship where some of the action took place , starpower 1 , built to prove that exploration and mining of the asteroid belt was feasible and potentially profitable , had a magnetohydrodynamic drive mated to a fusion power plant .
