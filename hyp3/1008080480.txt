andrews it was during a visit by kálmán to the nasa ames research center that schmidt saw the applicability of kálmán 's ideas to the nonlinear problem of trajectory estimation for the project apollo leading to its incorporation in the apollo navigation computer , physical laws of motion ) , known control inputs to that system , and multiple sequential measurements ( such as from sensors ) to form an estimate of the system 's varying quantities ( its state ) that is better than the estimate obtained by using only one measurement alone noisy sensor data , approximations in the equations that describe the system evolution , and external factors that are not accounted for all place limits on how well it is possible to determine the system 's state the kalman filter produces an estimate of the state of the system as an average of the system 's predicted state and of the new measurement using a weighted mean this means that kalman filter works recursively and requires only the last '' best guess '' , rather than the entire history , of a system 's state to calculate a new state the relative certainty of the measurements and current state estimate is an important consideration , and it is common to discuss the response of the filter in terms of the kalman filter 's gain in addition , since the truck is expected to follow the laws of physics , its position can also be estimated by integrating its velocity over time , determined by keeping track of wheel revolutions and the angle of the steering wheel in the prediction phase , the truck 's old position will be modified according to the physical laws of motion ( the dynamic or '' state transition '' model ) it is used in a wide range of engineering and econometric applications from radar and computer vision to estimation of structural macroeconomic models , and is an important topic in control theory and control systems engineering in the dempster–shafer theory , each state equation or observation is considered a special case of a linear belief function and the kalman filter is a special case of combining linear belief functions on a join-tree or markov tree a wide variety of kalman filters have now been developed , from kalman 's original formulation , now called the '' simple '' kalman filter , the kalman–bucy filter , schmidt 's '' extended '' filter , the information filter , and a variety of '' square-root '' filters that were developed by bierman , thornton , and many others at each discrete time increment , a linear operator is applied to the state to generate the new state , with some noise mixed in , and optionally some information from the controls on the system if they are known the kalman filter may be regarded as analogous to the hidden markov model , with the key difference that the hidden state variables take values in a continuous space as opposed to a discrete state space as in the hidden markov model chapter 13 , 'the kalman filter ' in order to use the kalman filter to estimate the internal state of a process given only a sequence of noisy observations one must model the process in accordance with the following framework this means specifying the following matrices : f k , the state-transition model ; h k , the observation model ; q k , the covariance of the process noise ; r k , the covariance of the observation noise ; and sometimes b k , the control-input model , for each time-step , k , as described below the kalman filter model assumes the true state at time k is evolved from the state at ( k & nbsp ; − & nbsp ; 1 ) according to : \mathbf the update equations are identical to those of the discrete-time kalman filter attitude and heading reference systems autopilot battery state of charge ( soc ) estimation brain-computer interfaces chaotic signals tracking and vertex fitting of charged particles in particle detectors tracking of objects in computer vision dynamic positioning in shipping economics , in particular macroeconomics , time series analysis , and econometrics inertial guidance system nuclear medicine – single photon emission computed tomography image restoration orbit determination power system state estimation radar tracker satellite navigation systems seismology sensorless control of ac motor variable-frequency drives simultaneous localization and mapping speech enhancement visual odometry weather forecasting navigation system 3d modeling structural health monitoring human sensorimotor processing
