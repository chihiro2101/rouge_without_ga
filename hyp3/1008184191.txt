the shorter preganglionic neurons originate in the thoracolumbar division of the spinal cord specifically at t1 to l2~l3 , and travel to a ganglion , often one of the paravertebral ganglia , where they synapse with a postganglionic neuron sympathetic nerves arise from near the middle of the spinal cord in the intermediolateral nucleus of the lateral grey column , beginning at the first thoracic vertebra of the vertebral column and are thought to extend to the second or third lumbar vertebra however , unlike somatic innervation , they quickly separate out through white rami connectors ( so called from the shiny white sheaths of myelin around each axon ) that connect to either the paravertebral ( which lie near the vertebral column ) or prevertebral ( which lie near the aortic bifurcation ) ganglia extending alongside the spinal column the ganglia include not just the sympathetic trunks but also the cervical ganglia ( superior , middle and inferior ) , which send sympathetic nerve fibers to the head and thorax organs , and the celiac and mesenteric ganglia , which send sympathetic fibers to the gut for example , the sympathetic nervous system can accelerate heart rate ; widen bronchial passages ; decrease motility ( movement ) of the large intestine ; constrict blood vessels ; increase peristalsis in the oesophagus ; cause pupillary dilation , piloerection ( goose bumps ) and perspiration ( sweating ) ; and raise blood pressure an alternative explanation is that the primary ( and direct ) effect of sympathetic stimulation on coronary arteries is vasoconstriction followed by a secondary vasodilation caused by the release of vasodilatory metabolites due to the sympathetically increased cardiac inotropy and heart rate fibers from the sns innervate tissues in almost every organ system , providing at least some regulation of functions as diverse as pupil diameter , gut motility , and urinary system output and function this response is also known as sympatho-adrenal response of the body , as the preganglionic sympathetic fibers that end in the adrenal medulla ( but also all other sympathetic fibers ) secrete acetylcholine , which activates the great secretion of adrenaline ( epinephrine ) and to a lesser extent noradrenaline ( norepinephrine ) from it sympathetic nervous system stimulation causes vasoconstriction of most blood vessels , including many of those in the skin , the digestive tract , and the kidneys these receptors exist throughout the vasculature of the body but are inhibited and counterbalanced by beta-2 adrenergic receptors ( stimulated by epinephrine release from the adrenal glands ) in the skeletal muscles , the heart , the lungs , and the brain during a sympathoadrenal response the afferent fibers of the autonomic nervous system , which transmit sensory information from the internal organs of the body back to the central nervous system ( or cns ) , are not divided into parasympathetic and sympathetic fibers as the efferent fibers are together with the other component of the autonomic nervous system , the parasympathetic nervous system , the sympathetic nervous system aids in the control of most of the body 's internal organs reaction to stress—as in the flight-or-fight response—is thought to counteract the parasympathetic system , which generally works to promote maintenance of the body at rest the comprehensive functions of both the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems are not so straightforward , but this is a useful rule of thumb in heart failure , the sympathetic nervous system increases its activity , leading to increased force of muscular contractions that in turn increases the stroke volume , as well as peripheral vasoconstriction to maintain blood pressure
