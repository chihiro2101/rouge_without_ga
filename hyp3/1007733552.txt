cardinal de retz in book ii of his memoirs attributes the usage to a witticism : '' bachoumont once said , in jest , that the parlement acted like the schoolboys in the paris ditches , who fling stones frondent , that is , fling using slings , and run away when they see the constable , but meet again as soon as he turns his back the insurrection did not start with revolutionary goals ; it aimed to protect the ancient liberties from royal encroachments and to defend the established rights of the parlements – courts of appeal rather than legislative bodies like the english parliaments – and especially the right of the parlement of paris to limit the king 's power by refusing to register decrees that ran against custom the movement soon degenerated into factions , some of which attempted to overthrow mazarin and to reverse the policies of his predecessor cardinal richelieu ( in office 1624–1642 ) who had taken power for the crown from great territorial nobles , some of whom became leaders of the fronde the term frondeur was later used to refer to anyone who suggested that the power of the king should be limited , and has now passed into conservative french usage to refer to anyone who will show insubordination or engage in criticism of the powers in place in may 1648 a tax levied on judicial officers of the parlement of paris provoked not merely a refusal to pay but also a condemnation of earlier financial edicts and a demand for the acceptance of a scheme of constitutional reforms framed by a united committee of the parlement ( the chambre saint-louis ) , composed of members of all the sovereign courts of paris in august 1648 , feeling strengthened by the news of the louis ii de bourbon , prince de condé 's battle of lens ( 20 august 1648 ) , mazarin suddenly arrested the leaders of the parlement , whereupon paris broke into insurrection and barricaded the streets but france 's signing of the peace of westphalia ( treaty of münster , 24 october 1648 ) allowed the french army to return from the frontiers , and by january 1649 condé had put paris under siege the leaders were discontented princes and nobles : gaston , duke of orleans ( the king 's uncle ) ; the great louis ii de bourbon and his brother armand , prince of conti ; frédéric , the duke of bouillon , and his brother henri , viscount of turenne but peasants of the countryside rose against the invaders ; the royal army in champagne was in the capable hands of caesar , duc de choiseul , who counted 52 years of age and 36 of war experience ; and the little fortress of guise successfully resisted the archduke 's attack the royal infantry had to be rearranged in order of regimental seniority , and turenne , seeing and desiring to profit by the attendant disorder , came out of his stronghold and attacked with the greatest vigour turenne himself , undeceived as to the part he was playing in the drama , asked and received the young king 's pardon , and meantime the court , with the and other loyal troops , had subdued the minor risings without difficulty ( march–april 1651 ) after this campaign the civil war ceased , but in the several other campaigns of the franco-spanish war that followed , the two great soldiers were opposed to one another , turenne as the defender of france , condé as a spanish invader condé invited the commander of turenne 's rearguard to supper , chaffed him unmercifully for allowing the prince 's men to surprise him in the morning , and by way of farewell remarked to his guest , ( '' it 's too bad decent people like us are cutting our throats for a scoundrel '' ) —an incident and a remark that displayed the feudal arrogance which ironically led to the iron-handed absolutism of louis xiv as to the latter , turenne maneuvered past condé and planted himself in front of the mercenaries , and their leader , not wishing to expend his men against the old french regiments , consented to depart with a money payment and the promise of two tiny lorraine fortresses the royalists attacked all along the line and won a signal victory in spite of the knightly prowess of the prince and his great lords , but at the critical moment gaston 's daughter persuaded the parisians to open the gates and to admit condé 's army the whole country , wearied of anarchy and disgusted with the princes , came to look to the king 's party as the party of order and settled government , and thus the fronde prepared the way for the absolutism of louis xiv the general war continued in flanders , catalonia , and italy wherever a spanish and a french garrison were face to face , and condé , with the wreck of his army , openly and defiantly entered the service of the king of spain at one moment , near péronne , condé had turenne at a serious disadvantage , but he could not galvanize the spanish general count fuensaldaña , who was more solicitous to preserve his master 's soldiers than to establish condé as mayor of the palace to the king of france , and the armies drew apart again without fighting on the night of 24–25 august the lines of circumvallation drawn round that place by the prince were brilliantly stormed by turenne 's army , and condé won equal credit for his safe withdrawal of the besieging corps under cover of a series of bold cavalry charges led by himself as usual , sword in hand the presence of the english contingent and its very definite purpose of making dunkirk a new calais , to be held by england forever , gave the next campaign a character of certainty and decision which was entirely wanting in the rest of the war
