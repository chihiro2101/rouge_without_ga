the novel is set in the american south in the 1930s , during the time of prohibition and jim crow laws that legalized racial segregation in the south it begins with the journey of lena grove , a young pregnant white woman from doane 's mill , alabama , who is trying to find lucas burch , the father of her unborn child at the end of the story , an anonymous man is talking to his wife about two strangers he picked up on a trip to tennessee , recounting that the woman had a child and the man was not the father although he has light skin and is an orphan with no knowledge of his family background , he believes that one of his parents is of african-american ancestry , and this secret has caused him to be a habitual wanderer due to its naturalistic , violent subject matter and obsession with the ghosts of the past , light in august is characterized as a southern gothic novel , a genre also exemplified by the works of faulkner 's contemporary carson mccullers , and by later southern writers like flannery o'connor , and truman capote jarraway view faulkner 's use of southern gothic genre tropes , such as the dilapidated plantation house and the focus on mystery and horror , as self-conscious modernist commentary on man 's '' warped relationship with the past '' and the impossibility of determining true identity according to daniel joseph singal , faulkner 's literary style gradually developed from 19th century victorian to modernist , with light in august more firmly grounded in the tradition of the latter the novel is characteristic of the modernist fascination with polarities & mdash ; light and dark , good and evil & mdash ; the burden of history on the present , and the splintering of personal identity as in his other novels , faulkner employs elements of oral storytelling , allowing different characters to lend voice to the narrative in their own distinct southern idiom some critics have speculated that the meaning of the title derives from a colloquial use of the word '' light '' to mean giving birth & mdash ; typically used to describe when a cow will give birth and be '' light '' again & mdash ; and connect this to lena 's pregnancy in august in mississippi there ’ s a few days somewhere about the middle of the month when suddenly there ’ s a foretaste of fall , it ’ s cool , there ’ s a lambence , a soft , a luminous quality to the light , as though it came not from just today but from back in the old classic times all of the protagonists in the novel are misfits and social outcasts surrounded by an impersonal and largely antagonistic rural community , which is represented metonymy through minor or anonymous characters both joe christmas and lena grove are orphans , strangers in town , and social outcasts , though the former draws anger and violence from the community , while the latter is looked down upon but receives generous assistance in her travels for example , echoing john 's famous , '' in the beginning was the word , and the word was with god '' , is lena 's insistent faith in the '' word '' of lucas , who is , after all , the father faulkner is considered one of the foremost american writers on race in the united states , and his novels , including light in august , often explore the persistent obsession with blood and race in the south that have carried over from the antebellum era to the 21st century christmas has light skin but is viewed as a foreigner by the people he meets , and the children in the orphanage in which he was raised called him '' nigger because of this , joe christmas is fixated on the idea that he has some african american blood , which faulkner never confirms , and views his parentage as an original sin that has tainted his body and actions since birth though christmas is guilty of violent crimes , faulkner emphasizes that he is under the sway of social and psychological forces that are beyond his control and force him to reenact the part of the mythical black murderer and rapist from southern history however , while women and minorities are both viewed as '' subversive '' and are restricted by the patriarchal society depicted in the novel , lena grove is able to travel safely and be cared for by people who hate and mistrust her , because she plays on the conventional rule that men are responsible for a woman 's wellbeing thus , she is the only stranger who is not alienated and destroyed by the people of jefferson , because the community recognizes her as the embodiment of nature and life in light in august , as in most of the other novels set in yoknapatawpha county , faulkner focuses mainly on poor white southerners , both from the upper and lower classes , who struggle to survive in the ruined post-war economy of the south the characters in light in august & mdash ; who are mostly from the lower classes , with the exception of reverend hightower and joanna burden & mdash ; are united by poverty and puritanical values that cause them to regard an unwed mother like lena grove with disdain when it was first published in 1932 , the novel was moderately successful ; 11,000 copies were initially printed , with a total of four printings by the end of the year , although a significant number of copies from the fourth printing had not been sold by 1936 these works initially met with approval from the nazi censors and received much attention from german literary critics , because they assumed that faulkner was a conservative agrarian positively depicting the struggle for racial purity ; soon after , however , faulkner 's works were banned by the nazis , and post-war german criticism reappraised him as an optimistic christian humanist according to michael millgate , though it is not typically considered faulkner 's best novel , light in august was recognized early on as being '' a major text , central to any understanding or evaluation of his career as a whole '' he argues that many of the early american critics , most of whom were urban northerners who viewed the south as backward and reactionary , focused on faulkner 's technical innovation in the field of narrative but missed or ignored the regional details and interconnectedness of the characters and setting to other works by the author in spite of these complaints , the novel came to be viewed positively because of its violence and dark themes , as this was a contrast to the sentimental , romantic southern literature of the time
