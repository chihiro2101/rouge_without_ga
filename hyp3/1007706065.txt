the demand for the analog synth sound led to development of a variety of analog modeling synthesizers—which emulate analog vcos and vcfs using samples , software , or specialized digital circuitry , and the construction of new analog keyboard synths such as the alesis andromeda , prophet '08 , and little phatty , as well as semi-modular and modular units thus , later analog synthesizers used the same building blocks , but integrated them into single units , eliminating patch cords in favour of integrated signal routing systems the lapse of patents in recent years , such as for the moog synthesizer transistor ladder filter , has spurred a return of diy and kit synthesizer modules , as well as an increase in the number of commercial companies selling analog modules they were generally '' modular '' synthesizers , consisting of a number of independent electronic modules connected by patch cables into a patchbay that resembled the jackfields used by 1940s-era telephone operators also during this period , a number of analog/digital hybrid synthesizers were introduced , which replaced certain sound-producing functions with digital equivalents , for example the digital oscillators in synthesizers like the korg dw-8000 ( which played back pcm samples of various waveforms ) and the kawai k5 ( waveforms constructed via additive synthesis ) while some electric instruments were produced in bulk , such as georges jenny 's ondioline , the hammond organ , and the trautonium , many of these would not be considered synthesizers by the standards of later instruments another factor considered to have increased use of analog synths since the 1990s is weariness with the complex screen-based navigation systems of digital synths , with the '' hands-on '' , practical controls of analog synths—potentiometer knobs , faders , and other features—offering a strong appeal however , some individual studios and instruments achieved a high level of sophistication , such as the trautonium of oskar sala , the electronium of raymond scott , and the ans synthesizer of evgeny murzin synthesizer modules in early analog synthesizers included voltage-controlled oscillators ( vcos ) , voltage-controlled filters ( vcfs ) , and voltage-controlled amplifiers ( vcas ) the earliest synthesizers used a variety of thermionic-valve ( vacuum tube ) and electro-mechanical technologies the minimoog also influenced the design of nearly all subsequent synthesizers , with integrated keyboard , pitch wheel and modulation wheel , and a vco- > vcf- > vca signal flow
