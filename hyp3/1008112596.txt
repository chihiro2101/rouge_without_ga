glass fiber is formed when thin strands of silica-based or other formulation glass are extruded into many fibers with small diameters suitable for textile processing the technique of heating and drawing glass into fine fibers has been known for millennia ; however , the use of these fibers for textile applications is more recent the modern method for producing glass wool is the invention of games slayter working at the owens-illinois glass company ( toledo , ohio ) the most common types of glass fiber used in fiberglass is e-glass , which is borosilicate glass with less than 1 % w/w alkali oxides , mainly used for glass-reinforced plastics other types of glass used are a-glass ( alkali-lime glass with little or no boron oxide ) , e-cr-glass ( electrical/chemical resistance ; alumino-lime silicate with less than 1 % w/w alkali oxides , with high acid resistance ) , c-glass ( alkali-lime glass with high boron oxide content , used for glass staple fibers and insulation ) , d-glass ( borosilicate glass , named for its low dielectric constant ) , r-glass ( alumino silicate glass without mgo and cao with high mechanical requirements as reinforcement ) , and s-glass ( alumino silicate glass without cao but with high mgo content with high tensile strength ) pure silica ( silicon dioxide ) , when cooled as fused quartz into a glass with no true melting point , can be used as a glass fiber for fiberglass , but has the drawback that it must be worked at very high temperatures ordinary a-glass ( '' a '' for '' alkali-lime '' ) or soda lime glass , crushed and ready to be remelted , as so-called cullet glass , was the first type of glass used for fiberglass e-glass ( '' e '' because of initial electrical application ) , is alkali free , and was the first glass formulation used for continuous filament formation s-glass ( '' s '' for '' strength '' ) is used when high tensile strength ( modulus ) is important , and is thus important in composites for building and aircraft construction c-glass ( '' c '' for '' chemical resistance '' ) and t-glass ( '' t '' is for '' thermal insulator '' â€“ a north american variant of c-glass ) are resistant to chemical attack ; both are often found in insulation-grades of blown fiberglass during drawing , the process where the hot glass is pulled to reduce the diameter of the fiber , the viscosity must be relatively low as it falls , it leaves a thread attached by the meniscus to the nozzle as long as the viscosity is in the correct range for fiber formation the smaller the annular ring of the nozzle and the thinner the wall at exit , the faster the drop will form and fall away , and the lower its tendency to wet the vertical part of the nozzle while some sizes are processing aids , others make the fiber have an affinity for a certain resin , if the fiber is to be used in a composite however , the safety of glass fiber is also being called into question , as research shows that the composition of this material ( asbestos and glass fiber are both silicate fibers ) can cause similar toxicity as asbestos the american conference of governmental industrial hygienists , on the other hand , says that there is insufficient evidence , and that glass fiber is in group a4 : '' not classifiable as a human carcinogen '' although both glass fiber and asbestos are made from silica filaments , naima claims that asbestos is more dangerous because of its crystalline structure , which causes it to cleave into smaller , more dangerous pieces , citing the u.s glass-reinforced plastic ( grp ) is a composite material or fiber-reinforced plastic made of a plastic reinforced by fine glass fibers as with many other composite materials ( such as reinforced concrete ) , the two materials act together , each overcoming the deficits of the other whereas the plastic resins are strong in compressive loading and relatively weak in tensile strength , the glass fibers are very strong in tension but tend not to resist compression it is also used to reinforce various materials , such as tent poles , pole vault poles , arrows , bows and crossbows , translucent roofing panels , automobile bodies , hockey sticks , surfboards , boat hulls , and paper honeycomb glass fiber use has recently seen use in biomedical applications in the assistance of joint replacement electric field-assisted orientation of short phosphate glass fibers on stainless steel for biomedical applications qiang chen , jiajia jing , hongfei qi , ifty ahmed , haiou yang , xianhu liu , t basalt fiber carbon fiber bs4994 composite materials fiberglass fiberglass molding filament tape gelcoat glass fiber reinforced concrete ( gfrc or grc ) glass microsphere glass poling glass wool optical fiber pele 's hair , naturally occurring glass fibre
