sallust 's time as governor of africa nova ought to have let the author develop a solid geographical and ethnographical background to the war ; however , this is not evident in the monograph , despite a diversion on the subject , because sallust 's priority in the jugurthine war , as with the catiline conspiracy , is to use history as a vehicle for his judgement on the slow destruction of roman morality and politics sallust 's account of the catiline conspiracy ( de coniuratione catilinae or bellum catilinae ) and of the jugurthine war ( bellum jugurthinum ) have come down to us complete , together with fragments of his larger and most important work ( historiae ) , a history of rome from 78 to 67 bc , intended as a continuation of cornelius sisenna 's work historians regret the loss of the work , as it must have thrown much light on a very eventful period , embracing the war against sertorius ( died 72 bc ) , the campaigns of lucullus against mithradates vi of pontus ( 75-66 bc ) , and the victories of pompey in the east ( 66–62 bc ) two letters ( duae epistolae de republica ordinanda ) , letters of political counsel and advice addressed to caesar , and an attack upon cicero ( invectiva or declamatio in ciceronem ) , frequently attributed to sallust , are thought by modern scholars to have come from the pen of a rhetorician of the first century ad , along with a counter-invective attributed to cicero roman history , xlii , 52 in 46 bc , he served as a praetor and accompanied caesar in his african campaign , which ended in the decisive defeat of the remains of the pompeian war party at thapsus the extant fragments of the histories ( some discovered in 1886 ) show sufficiently well the political partisan , who took a keen pleasure in describing the reaction against sulla 's policy and legislation after the dictator 's death sallust presents catiline as a deliberate foe of law , order and morality , and does not give a comprehensive explanation of his views and intentions ( catiline had supported the party of sulla , whom sallust had opposed ) on famous grammarians and rhetoricians , 10 ronald syme suggests that sallust 's choice of style and even particular words was influenced by his antipathy to cicero , his rival , but also one of the trendsetters in latin literature in the first century bc according to him , the conspiracy was prepared by sallust in 50 bc as a political pamphlet , but was not published ; after the civil war sallust reviewed and finally published it : mackay , l this is sallust 's first published work , an account of the attempt by lucius sergius catalina ( catiline ) to overthrow the roman republic in the year 63 bc in writing about the conspiracy of catiline , sallust 's tone , style , and descriptions of aristocratic behavior show that he was deeply troubled by the moral decline of rome as a reward for his services , sallust was appointed governor of the province of numidia — it is not clear why : sallust was not a skilled general , and the province was militarily significant , with three legions deployed there during the caesar 's civil war sallust acted as caesar 's partisan , but his role was not significant , so his name is not mentioned in the dictator 's commentarii de bello civili he took as his model thucydides , whom he imitated in his truthfulness and impartiality , in the introduction of philosophical reflections and speeches , and in the brevity of his style , sometimes bordering upon obscurity noctes atticae , x , 26 though quintilian has a generally favorable opinion of sallust , he disparages several features of his style : sallust struck out practically a new line in literature for himself : his predecessors had been little better than mere dry-as-dust chroniclers , but he endeavoured to explain the connection and meaning of events and successfully delineated character 247 from the beginning of his public career , sallust operated as a decided partisan of julius caesar , to whom he owed such political advancement as he attained sallust , as praetor designatus , with several other senators , was sent to persuade the soldiers to abstain , but the rebels killed two senators , and sallust narrowly escaped death 13.1 for his epigrammatic style : '' my sense of style , for the epigram as a style , was awakened almost instantly when i came into contact with sallust '' and praises him for being '' compact , severe , with as much substance as possible , a cold sarcasm against 'beautiful words ' and 'beautiful sentiments ' tacitus speaks highly of him ( annals , iii.30 ) ; and quintilian does not hesitate to put him on a level with thucydides , and declares that he is a greater historian than livy however , there is no conclusive evidence about this , and some scholars suppose that sallust did not become a quaestor — the practice of violating the cursus honorum was common in the last years of the republic sallust 's jugurthine war is a monograph recording the war against jugurtha in numidia from c in 50 bc , the censor appius claudius pulcher removed him from the senate on the grounds of gross immorality ( probably really because of his opposition to milo and cicero ) sallust , titus munatius plancus and quintus pompeius rufus also tried to blame cicero , one of the leaders of the senators ' opposition to the triumvirate , for his support of milo in any case , his knowledge of his own former weaknesses may have led him to take a pessimistic view of the morality of his fellow men , and to judge them severely some words used by sallust ( for example , antecapere , portatio , incruentus , incelebratus , incuriosus ) , are not known in other writings before him on his return to rome he purchased and began laying out in great splendour the famous gardens on the quirinal known as the horti sallustiani or gardens of sallust according to him , sallust once used the word transgressus meaning generally '' passage by foot '' for a platoon which crossed the sea ( the usual word for this type of crossing was transfretatio ) 36 it was reported by plutarch that sallust dined with caesar , hirtius , oppius , balbus and sulpicius rufus on the night after caesar 's famous crossing of the rubicon river into italy on 10 january the classification is based on the existence of the lacuna ( gap ) between 103.2 and 112.3 of the jugurthine war martial joins the praise : '' sallust , according to the judgment of the learned , will rank as the prince of roman historiographers '' 306 he became a tribune of the plebs in 52 bc , the year in which the followers of milo killed clodius in a street brawl '' princeps historiae romanae : sallust in renaissance political thought '' , memoirs of the american academy in rome , 40 ( 1995 ) , p '' princeps historiae romanae : sallust in renaissance political thought '' , memoirs of the american academy in rome , 40 ( 1995 ) , p the most ancient scrolls which survive are the codex parisinus 16024 and codex parisinus 16025 , known as '' p '' and '' a '' respectively he also uses the less common endings -ere instead of common -erunt in the third person plural in the perfect indicative , and -is instead of -es in the accusative plural for third declension ( masculine or feminine ) adjectives and nouns sallust then retired from public life and devoted himself to historical literature , and further developed his gardens , upon which he spent much of his accumulated wealth '' ) catiline 's conspiracy , the jugurthine war , histories ( trans 223 according to one inscription , some sallustius ( with unclear praenomen ) was a proquaestor in syria in 50 bc under marcus calpurnius bibulus
