armadillo 's x-prize vehicle was unorthodox among modern rockets in that instead of using stabilization fins , which complicate the design and increase drag , armadillo used an aerodynamically unstable design , where the computer controlled jet vanes based on feedback from fibre optic gyroscopes armadillo stated a preference for simplicity and reliability over performance , which was evident in its choice of hydrogen peroxide ( 50 % concentration in water ) and methanol as a mixed monopropellant for the vehicle the vehicles narrowly failed to win the level 1 prize , after making three dramatic attempts totalling over 5 minutes in the air , armadillo aerospace - news archive finally crashing out on the final attempt the plan was to have the first module ( of the next generation modular design ) compete at level 1 , and have pixel compete at level 2 challenge in the level 1 events , armadillo 's craft mod ( actually , module 1 ) logged several attempts , including several successful first leg flights , but was unable to complete the return trip during any attempt on the second attempt , the first leg flight was perfect ; increased guidance and control capabilities allowed the module to , in carmack 's words , 'burn the x-mark off the target pad ' the violence of the explosion embedded a piece of the graphite chamber in the ground 64 meters from the launch pad , and ended their attempts in 2007 for the prize however their landing accuracy was not sufficient to win the first prize , instead they won the second prize while masten space systems ' xoie lander won the level 2 first prize rocket racing , august 2008 , the rocket racing league was utilizing a highly modified velocity xl fg airframe and an armadillo aerospace 2,500 pound thrust liquid oxygen ( lox ) and ethanol rocket engine in both the mark-ii x-racer and mark-iii x-racer demonstration vehicles in late 2010 , armadillo started development of a new , longer rocket design created for lower-drag , higher-speed high-altitude flights , which they named stig in homage of the top gear driver the stig armadillo aerospace - news archive - jan 22 , 2011 this rocket had similar systems , motors , and component weights as the super mod vehicles , but was aerodynamically optimized for high-altitude flights with long diameter cylindrical tanks instead of larger spherical tanks during its early days , all of its employees ( including carmack ) had other , full-time jobs and contributed their efforts twice weekly to armadillo on a voluntary basis while details were sparse , john carmack said , '' there is a chance at this point that i may have written the last personal cheque i need to for armadillo '' armadillo aerospace - news archive in april 2008 , carmack offered an updated figure of '' total cost to date , about 3.5 million '' armadillo aerospace - news archive by 2010 , armadillo had 7 full-time employees , and was profitable on ongoing operations ( though carmack was continuing to invest in development efforts ) in august 2013 , carmack indicated that following the crash of the stig-b rocket earlier that year , he had wound down the company operations and had put the company in '' hibernation mode i seriously considered an otrag style massive-cluster-of-cheap-modules orbital design back when we had 98 % peroxide ( assumed to be a biprop with kerosene ) , and i have always considered it one of the viable routes to significant reduction in orbital launch costs armadillo aerospace company , which is developing the suborbital spaceship for space tourist flights , announced on monday that a russian has become its first confirmed passenger armadillo aerospace homepage project update with nvidia sponsorship information project update and video of successful vtol test flight project update on vehicle loss project update discussing intent to compete in lunar lander centennial challenge ( march 1 , 2006 ) official armadillo aerospace forum
