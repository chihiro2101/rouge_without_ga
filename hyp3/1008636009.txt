fermented foods have a long history in many cultures , with sauerkraut being one of the most well-known instances of traditional fermented moist cabbage side dishes although '' sauerkraut '' is a german word , the dish did not originate in germany , as fermenting cabbage as suan cai was already practised back in the days of the building of the great wall of china , and the practice was likely transmitted from china to europe by the tartary the names in slavic and other central and eastern european languages have similar meanings with the german word : '' fermented cabbage '' , , , , , , or '' sour cabbage '' , , , , , , , , , , , , , , kisla kapusta ) '' the word '' kraut '' , derived from this food , is a derogatory term for the german people '' during world war i , due to concerns the american public would reject a product with a german name , american sauerkraut makers relabeled their product as '' liberty cabbage '' for the duration of the war the ph of completely cured sauerkraut is about 3.6 ; see properly cured sauerkraut is sufficiently acidic to prevent a favorable environment for the growth of clostridium botulinum , the toxins of which cause botulism a 2004 genomic study found an unexpectedly large diversity of lactic acid bacteria in sauerkraut , and that previous studies had oversimplified this diversity this sourdough process is known as '' backslopping '' or '' inoculum enrichment '' ; when used in making sauerkraut , first- and second-stage population dynamics , important to developing flavor , are bypassed sometimes in russia the double fermentation is used , with the initial step producing an exceptionally sour product , which is then '' corrected '' by adding 30-50 % more fresh cabbage and fermenting the mix again sauerkraut is also the central ingredient in traditional soups , such as shchi ( a national dish of russia ) , kwaśnica ( poland ) , kapustnica ( slovakia ) , and zelňačka ( czech cuisine resp in france , sauerkraut is the main ingredient of the alsatian meal choucroute garnie ( french for '' dressed sauerkraut '' ) , sauerkraut with sausages ( strasbourg sausages , smoked morteau or montbéliard sausages ) , charcuterie ( bacon , ham , etc many health benefits have been claimed for sauerkraut : it is a high source of vitamins c and k ; the fermentation process increases the bioavailability of nutrients rendering sauerkraut even more nutritious than the original cabbage it is also low in calories and high in calcium and magnesium , and it is a very good source of dietary fiber , folate , iron , potassium , copper and manganese in 2002 , the journal of agriculture and food chemistry reported that finnish researchers found the isothiocyanates produced in sauerkraut fermentation inhibit the growth of cancer cells in test tube and animal studies a polish study in 2010 concluded that '' induction of the key detoxifying enzymes by cabbage juices , particularly sauerkraut , may be responsible for their chemopreventive activity demonstrated by epidemiological studies and in animal models '' one of the early scientists who was involved in identifying the biology and function of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats ( crispr ) , philippe horvath , focused on the genetics of a lactic-acid bacterium used in the production of sauerkraut
