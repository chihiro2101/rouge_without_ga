he probably was not the first person to aim the new invention at the night sky 16th century scientist leonard digges was described as pointing an early reflector/refractor device at the sky to see '' myriads of stars '' and thomas harriot made moon observations several months before galileo 's coyne , the three galileos : the man , the spacecraft , the telescope , astrophysics and space science library book series ( assl , volume 220 ) , pages 1-6 one of galileo 's first telescopes had 8x to 10x linear magnification and was made out of lenses that he had ground himself sidereus nuncius contains more than seventy drawings and diagrams of the moon , certain constellations such as orion , the pleiades , and taurus , and the galilean moons of jupiter in observing the moon , galileo saw that the line separating lunar day from night ( the terminator ) was smooth where it crossed the darker regions of the moon but quite irregular where it crossed the brighter areas galileo 's engravings of the lunar surface provided a new form of visual representation , besides shaping the field of selenography , the study of physical features on the moon galileo reported that he saw at least ten times more stars through the telescope than are visible to the naked eye , and he published star charts of the belt of orion and the star cluster pleiades showing some of the newly observed stars with the naked eye observers could see only six stars in the taurus cluster ; through his telescope , however , galileo was capable of seeing thirty-five – almost six times as many from this he deduced that the nebulae and the milky way were '' congeries of innumerable stars grouped together in clusters '' too small and distant to be resolved into individual stars by the naked eye throughout the text , galileo gave illustrations of the relative positions of jupiter and its apparent companion stars as they appeared nightly from late january through early march 1610 on january 11 after four nights of observation he wrote : : i therefore concluded and decided unhesitatingly , that there are three stars in the heavens moving about jupiter , as venus and mercury round the sun ; which at length was established as clear as daylight by numerous subsequent observations at the time of sidereus nuncius publication , galileo was a mathematician at the university of padua and had recently received a lifetime contract for his work in building more powerful telescopes three works of art were even created in response to galileo 's book : adam elsheimer 's the flight into egypt ( 1610 ) , cigoli 's assumption of the virgin ( 1612 ) , and andrea sacchi 's divine wisdom ( 1631 ) a common response to the medicean stars was simply to say that the telescope had a lens defect and was producing illusory points of light and images ; those saying this completely denied the existence of the moons that only a few could initially see and verify what galileo had observed supported the supposition that the optical theory during this period '' could not clearly demonstrate that the instrument was not deceiving the senses moran notes , “ the court itself became actively involved in pursuing the confirmation of galileo ’ s observations by paying galileo out of its treasury to manufacture spyglasses that could be sent through ambassadorial channels to the major courts of europe several astronomers , such as thomas harriot , joseph gaultier de la vatelle , nicolas-claude fabri de peiresc , and simon marius , published their confirmation of the medicean stars after jupiter became visible again in the autumn of 1610 therefore , the night galileo first observed jupiter 's moons was january 7 , 1610 on the gregorian calendar—december 28 , 1609 on the julian calendar ( marius claimed to have first observed jupiter 's moons on december 29 , 1609 ) galileo 's drawings of an imperfect moon directly contradicted ptolemy 's and aristotle 's cosmological descriptions of perfect and unchanging heavenly bodies made of quintessence ( the fifth element in ancient and medieval philosophy of which the celestial bodies are composed ) telescopes , tides , and tactics : a galilean dialogue about the starry messenger and systems of the world , including translation of galileo ’ s sidereus nuncius
