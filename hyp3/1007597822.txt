in 1979 , network time synchronization technology was used in what was possibly the first public demonstration of internet services running over a trans-atlantic satellite network , at the national computer conference in new york the technology was later described in the 1981 internet engineering note ( ien ) 173 and a public protocol was developed from it that was documented in the technology was first deployed in a local area network as part of the hello routing protocol and implemented in the fuzzball router , an experimental operating system used in network prototyping , where it ran for many years more complete synchronization systems , although lacking ntp 's data analysis and clock disciplining algorithms , include the unix daemon timed , which uses an election algorithm to appoint a server for all the clients ; and the digital time synchronization service ( dtss ) , which uses a hierarchy of servers similar to the ntp stratum model in 1985 , ntp version 0 ( ntpv0 ) was implemented in both fuzzball and unix , and the ntp packet header and round-trip delay and offset calculations , which have persisted into ntpv4 , were documented in despite the relatively slow computers and networks available at the time , accuracy of better than 100 milliseconds was usually obtained on atlantic spanning links , with accuracy of tens of milliseconds on ethernet networks it drew on the experimental results and clock filter algorithm documented in and was the first version to describe the client-server and peer-to-peer modes in 1991 , the ntpv1 architecture , protocol and algorithms were brought to the attention of a wider engineering community with the publication of an article by david l however the design of ntpv2 was criticized for lacking formal correctness by the dtss community , and the clock selection procedure was modified to incorporate marzullo 's algorithm for ntpv3 onwards the rfc included an analysis of all sources of error , from the master clock down to the final client , which enabled the calculation of a metric that helps choose the best server where several candidates appear to disagree they employ the same algorithms for peering and data sampling as stratum 2 , and can themselves act as servers for stratum 4 computers , and so on the ntp algorithms on each computer interact to construct a bellman-ford shortest-path spanning tree , to minimize the accumulated round-trip delay to the stratum 1 servers for all the clients in addition to stratum , the protocol is able to identify the synchronization source for each server in terms of reference identifier ( refid ) , where : t 0 is the client 's timestamp of the request packet transmission , : t 1 is the server 's timestamp of the request packet reception , : t 2 is the server 's timestamp of the response packet transmission and : t 3 is the client 's timestamp of the response packet reception simple network time protocol ( sntp ) is a less complex implementation of ntp , using the same protocol but without requiring the storage of state over extended periods of time all microsoft windows versions since windows 2000 include the windows time service ( w32time ) , which has the ability to synchronize the computer clock to an ntp server w32time was originally implemented for the purpose of the kerberos version 5 authentication protocol , which required time to be within 5 minutes of the correct value to prevent replay attacks the new implementation is sponsored by the linux foundation as a replacement for the reference implementation , as it was determined to be easier to write a new implementation from scratch than to reduce the size of the reference implementation although the ntp clock is actually halted during the event , because of the requirement that time must appear to be monotonically increasing , any processes that query the system time cause it to increase by a tiny amount , preserving the order of events some implementation errors are basic , such as a missing return statement in a routine , that can lead to unlimited access to systems that are running some versions of ntp in the root daemon a 2017 security audit of three ntp implementations , conducted on behalf of the linux foundation 's core infrastructure initiative , suggested that both ntp ntp securitynotice page nvd nist product search ntp and ntpsec nvd nist product search ntpsec were more problematic than chrony nvd nist product search chrony from a security standpoint
