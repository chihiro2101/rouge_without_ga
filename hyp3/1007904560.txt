there is no definite evidence about the life of aenesidemus , but his most important work , the pyrrhonian discourses was known to be dedicated to lucius aelius tubero , a friend of cicero and member of plato 's academy whom photius described as a colleague furthermore , it has been assumed that he took part under the leadership of philo of larissa and probably adopted pyrrhonism either in reaction to antiochus of ascalon introduction of stoic and peripatetic dogma into the academy or philo 's acceptance of provisional beliefs what little we know of aenesidemus is by way of photius ( in his myriobiblion ) , sextus empiricus , and also to a lesser extent by diogenes laërtius and philo of alexandria consequently , he says , neither the pyrrhonists nor the others know the truth in things ; but the philosophers of other persuasions , as well as being ignorant in general , and wearing themselves out uselessly and expending themselves in ceaseless torments , are also ignorant of the very fact that they have cognition of none of the things of which they think that they have gained cognition in writing the discourses aenesidemus addresses them to lucius tubero , one of his colleagues from the academy , a roman by birth , with an illustrious ancestry and a distinguished political career ) but the academics , he says , especially those from the present-day academy , are sometimes in agreement with stoic beliefs , and to tell the truth turn out to be stoics fighting with stoics for to make unambiguous assertions and denials , at the same time as stating as a generalization that no things are cognitive , introduces an undeniable conflict : how is it possible to recognize that this is true , this false , yet still entertain perplexity and doubt , and not make a clear choice of the one and avoidance of the other ? for if it is not known that this is good or bad , or that this is true but that false , and this existent but that non-existent , it must certainly be admitted that each of them is incognitive aenesidemus is considered the creator of the ten modes of aenesidemus ) —although whether he invented the tropes or just systematized them from prior pyrrhonist works is unknown these are as follows : different animals manifest different modes of perception ; similar differences are seen among individual men ; for the same man , information perceived with the senses is self-contradictory furthermore , it varies from time to time with physical changes in addition , this data differs according to local relations objects are known only indirectly through the medium of air , moisture , etc either in the pyrrhonian discourses or some other work that did not survive , aenesidemus assimilated the theories of heraclitus , as is discussed in the outlines of pyrrhonism of sextus empiricus for in sleep , when the openings of the senses dose , the mind which is in us is cut off from contact with that which surrounds us , and only our connexion with it by means of respiration is preserved as a sort of root ( from which the rest may spring again ) ; and , when it is thus separated , it loses the power of memory that it had before when we awake again , however , it looks out through the openings of the senses , as if through windows , and coming together with the surrounding mind , it assumes the power of reason just , then , as embers , when they are brought near the fire , change and become red-hot , and go out when they are taken away from it again , so does the portion of the surrounding mind which sojourns in our body become irrational when it is cut off , and so does it become of like nature to the whole when contact is established through the greatest number of openings
