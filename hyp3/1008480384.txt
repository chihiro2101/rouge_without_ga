the main component of any windowing system is usually called the display server , although alternative denominations such as window server or compositor are also in use any application that runs and presents its gui in a window , is a client of the display server the display server and its clients communicate with each other over a communications protocol , which is usually called display server protocol , the display server being the mediator between the clients and the user the output of sound is usually not managed by the display server , but the sound volume is usually handled through gui applets and it is the display server who decides which applications are on top a display server or window server is a program whose primary task is to coordinate the input and output of its clients to and from the rest of the operating system , the hardware , and each other one example of a display server is the x.org server , which runs on top of the kernel ( usually a unix-based kernel , such as linux or bsd ) the x.org server is a display server , but in its current implementation it relies on a second program , the compositing window manager , to do the compositing the display server still gets to decide which window is on top and thus visible to the user and also still is responsible for passing data regarding to input devices from evdev to its clients google developed a display server called surfaceflinger for android ( another linux kernel-based operating system primarily for mobile devices ) : everything in android is rendered to a '' surface '' ; '' surfaces '' are produced by applications and placed into a queue that is managed by surfaceflinger for apple 's macos family of operating systems , quartz compositor fulfils the tasks of a display server and of a window manager in the windowing system it was originally created to enable portions of the new '' windows aero '' user experience , which allowed for effects such as transparency , 3d window switching and more dm gem opie intuition microwindows minigui oohg visi on vax workstation software commercial systems such as microsoft windows ( xp , 9x and earlier ) , the classic mac os ( version 9 and earlier ) , and palm os , contain a windowing system which is integrated with the os
