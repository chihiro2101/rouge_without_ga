( note that running time is measured in terms of the size of the input , which in this case is ~ log & nbsp ; n , that being the number of bits needed to represent the number n unlike the other probabilistic tests , this algorithm produces a primality certificate , and thus can be used to prove that a number is prime these tests typically require factorization of n & nbsp ; + & nbsp ; 1 , n − 1 , or a similar quantity , which means that they are not useful for general-purpose primality testing , but they are often quite powerful when the tested number n is known to have a special form the first deterministic primality test significantly faster than the naive methods was the cyclotomy test ; its runtime can be proven to be o ( ( log & nbsp ; n ) c & nbsp ; log & nbsp ; log & nbsp ; log & nbsp ; n ) , where n is the number to test for primality and c is a constant independent of n a combination of shor 's algorithm , an integer factorization method , with the pocklington primality test could solve the problem in o ( ( \log n ) ^3 ( \log\log n ) ^2 \log\log\log n ) the simplest primality test is trial division : given an input number , n , check whether it is evenly divisible by any prime number between 2 and ( i.e similarly , under the generalized riemann hypothesis , the deterministic miller 's test , which forms the basis of the probabilistic miller–rabin test , can be proved to run in õ ( ( log & nbsp ; n ) 4 ) the lucas test relies on the fact that the multiplicative order of a number a modulo n is n − 1 for a prime n when a is a primitive root modulo n because of its tractability in practice , polynomial-time algorithms assuming the riemann hypothesis , and other similar evidence , it was long suspected but not proven that primality could be solved in polynomial time near the beginning of the 20th century , it was shown that a corollary of fermat 's little theorem could be used to test for primality
