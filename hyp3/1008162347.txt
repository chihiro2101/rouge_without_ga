in order to extend the working life of type , and to account for the finite sorts in a case of type , copies of forms were cast when anticipating subsequent printings of a text , freeing the costly type for other work during typesetting , individual sorts are picked from a type case with the right hand , and set into a composing stick held in the left hand from left to right , and as viewed by the setter upside down image : oscar wilde english renaissance of art 2.png thumb right 200px text sample ( an extract of the essay the renaissance of english art by oscar wilde ) typeset in iowan old style roman , italics and small caps , adjusted to approximately 10 line length , with the typeface sized at 14 points on 1.4 x leading , with 0.2 points extra tracking early minicomputer-based typesetting software introduced in the 1970s and early 1980s , such as datalogics pager , penta , atex , miles 33 , xyvision , troff from bell labs , and ibm 's script product with crt terminals , were better able to drive these electromechanical devices , and used text markup languages to describe type and other page formatting information in this process , called stereotyping , the entire form is pressed into a fine matrix such as plaster of paris or papier mâché called a flong to create a positive , from which the stereotype form was electrotyped , cast of type metal in 1985 , with the new concept of wysiwyg ( for what you see is what you get ) in text editing and word processing on personal computers , desktop publishing became available , starting with the apple macintosh , adobe pagemaker ( and later quarkxpress ) and postscript and on the pc platform with xerox ventura publisher under dos as well as pagemaker under windows ( webpage has a translation button ) character-by-character , computer-aided phototypesetting was , in turn , rapidly rendered obsolete in the 1980s by fully digital systems employing a raster image processor to render an entire page to a single high-resolution digital image , now known as imagesetting cast metal sorts were composed into words , then lines , then paragraphs , then pages of text and tightly bound together to make up a form , with all letter faces exactly the same '' height to paper '' , creating an even surface of type while some , such as the paige compositor , met with limited success , by the end of the 19th century , several methods had been devised whereby an operator working a keyboard or other devices could produce the desired text a chronology of computing at the university of waterloo the initial implementation of script at uw was documented in the may 1975 issue of the computing centre newsletter , which noted some the advantages of using script : the article also pointed out script had over 100 commands to assist in formatting documents , though 8 to 10 of these commands were sufficient to complete most formatting jobs the data stream used by these systems to drive page layout on printers and imagesetters , often proprietary or specific to a manufacturer or device , drove development of generalized printer control languages , such as adobe systems ' postscript and hewlett-packard 's pcl as seen in the photo of the composing stick , a lower case ' q ' looks like a 'd ' , a lower case ' b ' looks like a ' p ' , a lower case ' p ' looks like a ' b ' and a lower case 'd ' looks like a ' q ' still , hand composition and letterpress printing have not fallen completely out of use , and since the introduction of digital typesetting , it has seen a revival as an artisanal pursuit the linotype machine , invented in 1884 , used a keyboard to assemble the casting matrices , and cast an entire line of type at a time ( hence its name ) the diagram at right

proverbial shoemaker 's children who went barefoot '' ) did not use any computers in production until its august 1979 issue used a compugraphics system for typesetting and page layout they did not ,
