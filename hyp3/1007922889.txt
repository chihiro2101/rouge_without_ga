the album swung from glam and garage rock numbers ( '' night vision '' , '' the teacher '' ) to novelty techno ( '' wherever i lay my phone ( that 's my home ) '' ) , ambient indietronica ( '' some things come from nothing '' ) and upbeat drum and bass ( '' the door to this house remains open '' ) in february 1996 , the band 's debut on creation , '' hometown unicorn '' , became new musical express 's single of the week , chosen by guest reviewers pulp , and the first super furry animals single to chart in the uk top 50 , peaking at no drummer ieuan formed a band known as the peth which has been described by rhys in various magazine articles as '' satanic abba '' : the band also reunites rhys ifans with the sfa family , as he takes lead vocal duties the band are considered to be part of the renaissance of welsh music ( and art , and literature ) in the 1990s : other welsh bands of the time include the manic street preachers , stereophonics , catatonia and gorky 's zygotic mynci sfa unleashed their experimental side on tracks such as '' sidewalk serfer girl '' ( which switches between light techno-pop and hardcore punk ) , '' a touch sensitive '' ( gloomy trip-hop ) and '' no sympathy '' ( which descends into chaotic drum ' n'bass ) , but also apparent was an angrier edge to the lyrics : '' run ! christian , run ! '' seemed to be an attack on the complacency of organised religion in early 2005 , gruff rhys released a solo album yr atal genhedlaeth , ( '' the stuttering generation '' , and also a play on words as '' atal genhedlu '' means contraception ) , sung all in welsh the laid-back ambience recalls early-1970s beach boys albums such as surf 's up ( which sfa have referred to as one of their favourite albums ) , whilst the heavy use of strings suggested the likes of scott walker and curtis mayfield gruff rhys has also signed for rough trade records as a solo artist in his own right and released a single on 7 '' vinyl and download entitled '' candylion '' in late 2006 which preceded an album of the same name that was released during the second week of 2007 the band also selected tracks for a volume in the under the influence series of compilations , in which artists present the songs that they feel have most contributed to their sound she was making super furry animals t-shirts for the fashion and music collective acid casuals ( variants of whose name have appeared throughout super furry animals ' career – for example , in their song '' the placid casual '' , their record label placid casual ) layers of samples over brass , percussion and gruff 's melodic singing produced an album which took the freewheeling approach of 1960s groups such as the beatles , the beach boys and the velvet underground and updated it to the late 1990s this was a collection of songs from the 1995 ankst releases ( including '' dim brys : dim chwys '' ) , the band 's favourite b-sides , plus '' the man do n't give a fuck '' and '' smokin ' '' after bunford and ciaran ( ieuan 's younger brother ) joined , they wrote some songs , and in 1995 signed to ankst , a welsh indie label they accompanied this with a download single , '' slow life '' , which also included the track '' motherfokker '' , a collaboration with goldie lookin chain , both tracks are now available as a free download via the placid casual website perhaps recognising that their approach to phantom power had been a little too straightforward , the group followed it up in 2004 with a remix version , phantom phorce , with tracks reworked by the likes of killa kela , four tet and brave captain however , there were problems in clearing a sample from '' showbiz kids '' by steely dan which formed the basis of the chorus , and it was switched for a different track the album 's first single , '' show your hand '' , failed to enter the top 40 , their first to do so since 1996 's '' hometown unicorn '' , despite modest airplay the earliest super furry animals track commercially available is '' dim brys : dim chwys '' , recorded in 1994 for radio cymru : an ambient piece , the track shows the band 's techno roots the ep 's title is also a pun on the welsh '' mwg drwg '' , meaning '' wacky baccy '' ( slang for cannabis , more literally '' bad ( or naughty ) smoke '' ) the final single from the album , '' if you do n't want me to destroy you '' , was to have been backed by a track called '' the man do n't give a fuck '' one of the tracks from the album , '' receptacle for the respectable '' featured paul mccartney on '' carrot and celery rhythm track '' ( a homage to his performance on the beach boys ' '' vegetables '' ) unlike his debut yr atal genhedlaeth , candylion is primarily sung in english but has two welsh tracks and one in '' bad spanish '' : it is primarily an acoustic album , and came about because rhys has written several acoustic pop songs that did n't fit with the direction of the new sfa record however , super furry animals regarded '' the man do n't give a fuck '' as one of their best songs and continued their efforts to clear the sample the ceremony took place on the day after the terror attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon , and sfa 's performance of the album track '' it 's not the end of the world ?
