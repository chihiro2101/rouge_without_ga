as a result , obituaries reported his age at the time of his death as 70 rather than 74 his parents were sam marx ( called '' frenchie '' throughout his life ) , and his wife , minnie marx chandler ? '' chandler : '' say , how did you get to be an italian ? '' ravelli : '' never mindâ€”whose confession is this ? '' in a night at the opera , which begins in italy , his character , fiorello , claims not to be italian , eliciting a surprised look from groucho : driftwood ( groucho ) : '' well , things seem to be getting better around the country '' a scene in the film go west , in which chico attempts to placate an indian chief of whom groucho has run afoul , has a line that plays a bit on chico 's lack of italian nationality , but is more or less proper marxian wordplay : s quentin quayle ( groucho ) : '' can you talk indian ? '' joe panello ( chico ) : '' i was born in indianapolis ! '' there are moments , however , where chico 's characters appear to be genuinely italian ; examples include the film the big store , in which his character ravelli runs into an old friend he worked with in naples ( after a brief misunderstanding due to his accent ) , the film monkey business , in which chico claims his grandfather sailed with christopher columbus , and their very first outing the cocoanuts , where mr hammer ( groucho ) asks him if he knew what an auction was , in which he responds '' i come from italy on the atlantic ocean ! '' chico 's character is often assumed to be dim-witted , as he frequently misunderstands words spoken by other characters ( particularly groucho ) lyons plays some ornate riffs on the violin ; chico comments , '' look-a , mister lyons , i know you wan na make a good impression , but please don't-a play better than me ! '' in a record album about the marx brothers , narrator gary owens stated that '' although chico 's technique was limited , his repertoire was not '' the opposite was true of harpo , who reportedly could play only two tunes on the piano , which typically thwarted chico 's scam and resulted in both brothers being fired other examples of his keyboard flamboyance are found in a night at the opera ( 1935 ) , where he plays the piano for a group of delighted children , and a night in casablanca ( 1946 ) , where he performs a rendition of '' the beer barrel polka '' furthermore , it was chico 's connection with irving thalberg of metro-goldwyn-mayer that led to thalberg 's signing the brothers when they were in a career slump after duck soup ( 1933 ) , the last of their films for paramount through the 1950s , chico occasionally appeared on a variety of television anthology shows and some television commercials , most memorably with harpo in '' the incredible jewelry robbery '' , a pantomime episode of general electric theater in 1959 during groucho 's live performance at carnegie hall in 1972 , he states that his brother got the name chico because he was a '' chicken-chaser '' ( early 20th century slang for womanizer ) '' gummo marx , in an interview years after chico 's death , said : '' chico 's favorite people were actors who gambled , producers who gambled , and women who screwed 132 chico 's lifelong gambling addiction compelled him to continue in show business long after his brothers had retired in comfort from their hollywood income , and in the early 1940s he found himself playing in the same small , cheap halls in which he had begun his career 30 years earlier the marx brothers ' penultimate film , a night in casablanca ( 1946 ) , was made for chico 's benefit since he had filed for bankruptcy a few years prior because of his out-of-control gambling , the brothers finally took the money as he earned it and put him on an allowance , on which he stayed until his death '' i wish that harpo and chico could be here to share with me this great honor , '' he said , naming the two deceased brothers ( zeppo was still alive at the time and in the audience )
