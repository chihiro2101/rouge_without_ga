thus , lester grabbe points to a number of parallels between the azazel narrative in enoch and the wording of leviticus 16 , including '' the similarity of the names asael and azazel ; the punishment in the desert ; the placing of sin on asael/azazel ; the resultant healing of the land however , he did not see the sending of the goat as honouring azazel as a deity , but as a symbolic expression of the idea that the people 's sins and their evil consequences were to be sent back to the spirit of desolation and ruin , the source of all impurity in older english versions , such as the king james version , the phrase la-azazel is translated as '' as a scapegoat '' ; however , in most modern english bible translations , it is represented as a name in the text : later rabbis , interpreting azazel as azaz ( rugged ) and el ( of god ) , take it as referring to the rugged and rough mountain cliff from which the goat was cast down '' thus , the place of asael ’ s punishment designated in enoch as dudael is reminiscent of the rabbinic terminology used for the designation of the ravine of the scapegoat in later rabbinic interpretations of the yom kippur ritual ” guide to the perplexed 3:46 , featured on the internet sacred text archive the rite , resembling , on one hand , the sending off of the basket with the woman embodying wickedness to the land of shinar in the vision of zechariah , and , on the other , the letting loose of the living bird into the open field in the case of the leper healed from the plague , was , indeed , viewed by the people of jerusalem as a means of ridding themselves of the sins of the year ) , and the arrival of the shattered animal at the bottom of the valley of the rock of bet ḥadudo , twelve miles away from the city , was signalized by the waving of shawls to the people of jerusalem , who celebrated the event with boisterous hilarity and amid dancing on the hills ( yoma vi in the dead sea scrolls , the name azazel occurs in the line 6 of 4q203 , the book of giants , which is a part of the enochic literature found at qumran in the hebrew bible , the term is used thrice in leviticus 16 , where two male goats were to be sacrificed to yahweh and one of the two was cleromancy , for yahweh is seen as speaking through the lots a man was selected , preferably a priest , to take the goat to the precipice in the wilderness ; and he was accompanied part of the way by the most eminent men of jerusalem the high priest then laid his hands with the labels upon the two goats and said , '' a sin-offering to yahweh '' ( thus speaking the tetragrammaton ) ; and the two men accompanying him replied , '' blessed be the name of his glorious kingdom for ever and ever men were stationed at intervals along the way , and as soon as the goat was thrown down the precipice , they signaled to one another by means of kerchiefs or flags , until the information reached the high priest , whereat he proceeded with the other parts of the ritual the very fact that the two goats were presented before god , before the one was sacrificed and the other sent into the wilderness , was proof that azazel was not ranked alongside god , but regarded simply as the personification of wickedness in contrast with the righteous government of god the book of enoch 8:1–3a reads , '' and azazel taught men to make swords and knives and shields and breastplates ; and made known to them the metals of the earth and the art of working them ; and bracelets and ornaments ; and the use of antimony and the beautifying of the eyelids ; and all kinds of costly stones and all colouring tinctures the modern english standard version provides the footnote '' 16:8 the meaning of azazel is uncertain ; possibly the name of a place or a demon , traditionally a scapegoat ; also verses 10 , 26 '' in later times the change to white was not invariable : a proof of the people 's moral and spiritual deterioration , that was gradually on the increase , until forty years before the destruction of the second temple , when the change of color was no longer observed ( l.c … there were giants in the earth in those days ; and also afterward , when the sons of god came in unto the daughters of men , and they bore children to them , the same became mighty men which were of old , men of renown in islam , azazel appears in relation to the story of harut and marut , a pair of angels mentioned in the quran having one of these on his right and the other on his left , the high priest , who was assisted in this rite by two subordinates , put both his hands into a wooden case , and took out two labels , one inscribed '' for yahweh '' and the other '' for azazel '' '' he then fastened a scarlet woolen thread to the head of the goat '' for azazel '' ; and laying his hands upon it again , recited the following confession of sin and prayer for forgiveness : '' o lord , i have acted iniquitously , trespassed , sinned before thee : i , my household , and the sons of aaron thy holy ones 31:5 ) , and earlier says to azazel himself , '' may you be the firebrand of the furnace of the earth ! go , azazel , into the untrodden parts of the earth 39a ) that during the forty years that simeon the just was high priest of israel , the thread actually turned white as soon as the goat was thrown over the precipice : a sign that the sins of the people were forgiven & nbsp ; 196–204 according to the book of enoch , azazel ( here spelled ‘ ăzā ’ zyēl ) was one of the chief grigori , a group of fallen angels who married women the vulgate contains no mention of '' azazel '' but only of caper emissarius , or '' emissary goat '' : english versions , such as the king james version , followed the septuagint and vulgate in understanding the term as relating to a goat '' the book of enoch brings azazel into connection with the biblical story of the war in heaven , located on mount hermon , a gathering-place of demons of old but the ancient understanding of benê ’ ʾělō·hîm as supernatural beings was so firmly established over the history of israel and judah that in the septuagint , which was completed some time between the 3rd and 1st century b.c , the term '' sons of god '' is replaced with '' angels of god '' in all three of these verses & nbsp ; 38 here , azazel is one of the leaders of the rebellious watchers in the time preceding the flood ; he taught men the art of warfare , of making swords , knives , shields , and coats of mail , and taught women the art of deception by ornamenting the body , dyeing the hair , and painting the face and the eyebrows , and also revealed to the people the secrets of witchcraft and corrupted their manners , leading them into wickedness and impurity until at last he was , at yahweh 's command , bound hand and foot by the archangel raphael and chained to the rough and jagged rocks of ha dudael ( beth ḥadudo ) , where he is to abide in utter darkness until the great day of judgment , when he will be cast into the fire to be consumed forever just as in 3 enoch , angels complained about humans iniquity , whereupon god offered a test , that the angels might choose three among them to descend to earth , endowed with bodily desires , and proof that they would do better than humans under the same conditions
