gelon 's first major contribution to greek , and more specifically sicilian , history was the foundation of syracuse as his capital , which he turned into “ the greatest greek city in the west according to herodotus , upon his return to his capital , gelon organized a meeting with the people of syracuse , and described to them his actions during the war with hamilcar , and the manner in which he dispersed the spoils one of his later ancestors , telines , was said to have reconciled his people after a period of civil strife through the divine rites of the earth goddesses ; herodotus infers that all of telines ' descendants , including gelon , were priests of this cult according to herodotus , because he was raised as a noble and was constantly in the presence of nobility , gelon did not care for the lower class , and “ found the common people unpleasant to share a house with ” according to herodotus , gelon 's ancestors came from the island of tilos in the aegean sea and were the founders of the city of gela in southern sicily if , as many historians believe , the persian and carthaginian armies were in contact with each other , a defeat at himera for gelon could have led to a two pronged attack on the greek mainland by the persian and the carthaginians , and perhaps to the eventual demise of greek civilisation in 485 bc , the aristocracy of syracuse called the gamori , who had been forced out of the city by the common people , came to gelon seeking his aid the riches collected from the carthaginian camp , as well as the 2,000 talents of silver that resulted from the peace treaty with carthage , were dispersed by gelon among his troops and his allies , with a large amount designated for the construction of a new temple in syracuse the people of syracuse decided to keep gelon as their tyrant , and he continued his reign in peace for the next two years deinomenes consulted an oracle about the fates of his children , and was told that gelon , hieron and thrasybulus were all destined to become tyrants gelon found a powerful ally in theron , tyrant of acragas , a city west of gela , after he married theron 's daughter , demareta the territory now under his control as tyrant included that of gela , naxos in the east , zancle in the northeast , and camarina in the south perhaps the greatest testament to his influence over sicily is how his statue was spared as timoleon tried to erase all memory of the reign of tyrants when sicily became a democracy 150 years after gelon 's death despite gelon 's mistreatment of conquered people , his reputation as a respected tyrant and generous king survived the passage of time gelon , upon hearing the danger his ally theron was in , led an army of 50,000 men and 5,000 cavalry to himera
