( 2 ) obtaining ideas through objects rather than words ; ( 3 ) starting with objects most familiar to the child to introduce him to both the new language and the more remote world of objects ; ( 4 ) giving the child a comprehensive knowledge of his environment , physical and social , as well as instruction in religious , moral , and classical subjects ;
