eurocentrism 's reach has not only affected the perception of the cultures and civilizations of the islamic world , but also the aspects and ideas of orientalism , a cultural idea that distinguished the '' orient '' of the east from the '' occident '' western societies of europe and north america , and which was originally created so that the social and cultural milestones of the islamic and oriental world would be recognized crashcourse '' eurocentrism '' ( 2012 ) : loewen , james '' lies my teacher told me '' ( 1995 ) in the 1990s , there was a trend of criticizing various geographic terms current in the english language as eurocentric , such as the traditional division of eurasia into europe and asia martin lewis and kären wigen in their book , the myth of continents ( 1997 ) : '' in physical , cultural and historical diversity , china and india are comparable to the entire european landmass , not to a single european country in treatises on historical or contemporary eurocentrism that appeared since the 1990s , eurocentrism is mostly cast in terms of dualisms such as civilized/barbaric or advanced/backward , developed/undeveloped , core/periphery , implying '' evolutionary schemas through which societies inevitably progress '' , with a remnant of an '' underlying presumption of a superior white western self as referent of analysis '' ( 640 in southern europe and latin america , a number of academic proposals to offer alternatives to the eurocentric perspective have emerged , such as the project of the epistemologies of the south by portuguese scholar boaventura de sousa santos and those of the subaltern studies groups in india and latin america ( the modernity/coloniality group of anibal quijano , edgardo lander , enrique dussel , santiago castro-gómez , ramón grosfoguel , and others during the 15th to 18th centuries , a great divergence took place , comprising the european renaissance , age of discovery , the formation of the colonial empires , the age of reason , and the associated leap forward in technology and the development of capitalism and early industrialisation eurocentrism and the dualistic properties that it labels on non-european countries , cultures and persons have often been criticized in the political discourse of the 1990s and 2000s , particularly in the greater context of political correctness , race in the united states and affirmative action but she said that the tests did reflect a negative portrayal of black dolls in american theater and media that dates back to the civil war era.thus , bernstein said , the choices made by the subjects of the clark doll tests was not necessarily an indication of black self-hatred the brockhaus enzyklopädie ( conversations-lexicon ) of 1847 still has an ostensibly eurocentric approach and claims about europe that '' its geographical situation and its cultural and political significance is clearly the most important of the five continents , over which it has gained a most influential government both in material and even more so in cultural aspects '' this construct has gained power from the historians revolving their conclusions around the idea of a central point that favors the notion that the evolution of societies and their progress are dictated by general tendencies , leading to the islamic world 's evolution becoming more of a philosophical topic of history instead of historical fact on the other hand , in an article , 'eurocentrism and academic imperialism ' by professor seyed mohammad marandi , from the university of tehran , states that eurocentric thought exists in almost all aspects of academia in many parts of the world , especially in the humanities this exclusion was seen as acceptable by individuals like john westlake , a professor of international law at the university of cambridge at the time , who commented that countries with european civilizations should be who comprises the international society , and that countries like turkey and persia should only be allowed a part of international law there has been some debate on whether historical eurocentrism qualifies as '' just another ethnocentrism '' , as it is found in most of the world 's cultures , especially in cultures with imperial aspirations , as in the sinocentrism in china ; in the empire of japan ( c these scholars believed that the same contribution made by the west gives westerners an advantage of endo-genetic momentum which is pushed towards the rest of the world , but frank believed that the oriental countries also contributed to the human civilization in their own perspectives through this action , eurocentric researchers ' understanding of oriental and islamic culture was intentionally left undermined , foregoing the reasoning behind the actions and reasoning for the changes in culture documented by islamic and oriental texts and allowing for further possible western influence on orientalism , and increasing the difficulty of identifying what is truly oriental and what is considered oriental by the west linco state that '' in some ways , the epistemological critique initiated by indigenous knowledge is more radical than other sociopolitical critiques of the west , for the indigenous critique questions the very foundations of western ways of knowing and being in some cases , as china , where local ideology was even more exclusionist than the eurocentric one , westernisation did not overwhelm longstanding chinese attitudes to its own cultural centrality , but some would state that idea itself is a rather desperate attempt to cast europe in a good light by comparison european exceptionalism thus grew out of the great divergence of the early modern period , due to the combined effects of the scientific revolution , the commercial revolution , and the rise of colonial empires , the industrial revolution and a second european colonization wave in the protestant ethic and the spirit of capitalism , he wrote that the '' rational '' capitalism manifested by its enterprises and mechanisms only appear in the protestant western countries , and a series of generalized and universal cultural phenomena only appear in the west the -ism eurocentrism ( french eurocentrisme , earlier europocentrisme ) as the term for an ideology was coined in the 1970s by the egyptian marxian economist samir amin , then director of the african institute for economic development and planning of the united nations economic commission for africa blaut ( 2000 ) argued that eurocentrism indeed went beyond other ethnocentrisms , as the scale of european colonial expansion was historically unprecedented and resulted in the formation of a '' colonizer 's model of the world '' in this state , eurocentrism has used orientalism to portray the orient as '' backwards '' and bolster the superiority of the western world and continue the undermining of their cultures to further the agenda of racial inequality eric sheppard , in 2005 , argued that contemporary marxism itself has eurocentric traits ( in spite of '' eurocentrism '' originating in the vocabulary of marxian economics ) , because it supposes that the third world must go through a stage of capitalism before '' progressive social formations can be envisioned '' with more researchers wanting to study more of orientalism , there was an assumption made about the languages of the islamic world : that having the ability to transcribe the texts of the past islamic world would give great knowledge and insight on oriental studies the eurocentric influence is shown in the latter , as the nature of manifest orientalism is to be altered with new findings , which leaves it vulnerable to the warping of its refiner 's ideals and principles georg wilhelm friedrich hegel in lectures on the philosophy of history , claimed that world history started in asia but shifted to greece and italy , and then north of the alps to france , germany and england eurocentrism have come to play a role in the 2000s to 2010s in the context of the political discourse on race in the united states and critical whiteness studies , aiming to expose white supremacism and white privilege '' prevalent during the nineteenth century , the labeling of uncivilized in the eyes of eurocentrists enabled western countries to classify non-european and non-white countries as inferior , and limit their inclusion and contribution in actions like international law the figurative superiority resulting from the rise of '' european civilization '' and the labels of '' civilized '' and '' uncivilized '' are partly responsible for eurocentrism 's denial of islamic social evolution , giving westerners the advantage of an early dismissal of such ideas regarding oriental civilizations through comparisons to the west stemming from eurocentrism 's innate bias towards western civilization came the creation of the concept of the '' european society , '' which favored the components ( mainly christianity ) of european civilization and allowed eurocentrists to brand diverging societies and cultures as '' uncivilized thus , johann heinrich zedler , in 1741 , wrote that '' even though europe is the smallest of the four continents , it has for various reasons a position that places it before all others portrayal of european colonialism in such literature has been analysed in terms of eurocentrism in retrospect , such as presenting idealised and often exaggeratedly masculine western heroes , who conquered 'savage ' peoples in the remaining 'dark spaces ' of the globe according to alexander edmond 's book pretty modern : beauty , sex , and plastic surgery in brazil , whiteness plays a role in latin american , specifically brazilian , beauty standards , but it is not necessarily distinguished based on skin color she points out an importance of also looking at who is n't being represented and what the implications of that are as they could reveal two issues : the past exclusion of '' africans , asians and aboriginals '' from editorial and advertisement content and then distorted '' representation and coverage '' of ''

of oklahoma press ella shohat and robert stam ( 1994 ) unthinking eurocentrism : multiculturalism and the media during the european colonialism , encyclopedias often sought to give a rationale for the predominance of european rule during the colonial period by referring to a special position taken by europe compared to the other continents hussein abdilahi bulhan , frantz fanon and the psychology of oppression ( 1985 ) , 63ff : '' fanon and eurocentric psychology '' , where '' eurocentric psychology '' refers to '' a psychology derived from a white , middle-class male minority , which is generalized to humanity everywhere '' along with this , eurocentrism extends to trivialize and marginalize the philosophies , scientific contributions , cultures , and other additional facets of the islamic world he believed that although western capitalism shrouded the world and achieved a political unity based on its economy , the western countries can not '' westernize '' other countries eze , race and the enlightenment : a reader ( blackwell , 1997 ) luke clossey and nicholas guyatt have measured the degree of eurocentrism in the research programs of top history departments along with that , the rooted belief of the inferiority of non-white and non-europeans has given justification for racial discrimination and discredit to the islamic world , with much of these feelings still present today eurocentrism 's effect on the islamic world has predominantly come from a fundamental statement of preventing the account of lower-level explanation and account of islamic cultures and their social evolution , mainly through eurocentrism 's idealist construct in its quest for certainty , western philosophy continues to generate what it imagines to be colorless and genderless accounts of knowledge , reality , morality , and human nature '' some complications experienced are exogenous ochronosis , impaired wound healing and wound dehiscence , the fish odor syndrome , nephropathy ,
