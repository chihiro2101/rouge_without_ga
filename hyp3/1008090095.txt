the famicom disk system briefly served as an enabling technology for the creation of a new wave of home console video games and a new type of video game experience , mostly due to tripling the size of cheap game storage compared to affordable cartridge roms , and by storing gamers ' progress within their vast new adventures almost one decade ahead of nintendo 's satellaview service , the fds 's writable and portable storage technology served as an enabling technology for the innovation of online leaderboards and contests via the in-store disk fax kiosks , which are now seen as the earliest forerunners of modern online game and distribution players could take advantage of the dynamic rewritability of blue floppy disk versions of disk system games ( such as famicom grand prix : f1 race and golf japan course ) in order to save their high scores at their leisure at home , and then bring the disk to a retailer 's disk fax kiosk , which collated and transmitted the players ' scores via fax to nintendo these games include the open world design and enduring series launches of the legend of zelda ( 1986 ) and metroid ( 1986 ) , with its launch game zelda considered to be one of the greatest games of all time due mostly to its expansiveness retailers were critical of nintendo simply abandoning the disk writers and leaving stores with large kiosks that took up vital space , while companies began to release or move their games from the disk system to a standard cartridge ; towards the end of development , squaresoft ported final fantasy over to the famicom as a cartridge game , with its own battery backup save feature for its proprietary diskette platform , which they dubbed the '' disk card '' , nintendo chose to base it on mitsumi 's quick disk media format , a cheaper alternative to floppy disks for japanese home computers calling the disk writer '' one of the coolest things nintendo ever created '' , kotaku says modern '' digital distribution could learn from disk writer '' , and that the system 's premise of game rental and achievements would still be innovative in today 's retail and online stores third-party developers for the disk system were also angered towards nintendo 's strict licensing terms , requiring that it receive 50 % copyright ownership of any and all software released — this led to several major developers , such as namco and hudson soft , refusing to produce games for it four months after the disk system was released , capcom released a famicom conversion of ghosts ' n goblins on a 128k cartridge , which as a result made consumers and developers less impressed with the disk system 's technological features it would relaunch the model of games downloadable to rewritable portable media from store kiosks , with the nintendo power service in japan which is based on rewritable flash media cartridges for super famicom and game boy from 1997–2007 some are fds exclusives , some are disk writer exclusives , and many were re-released years later on the cartridge format such as the legend of zelda for nes in 1987 and for famicom in 1994 in 1986 , as video gaming had increasingly expanded from computers into the video game console market , nintendo advertised a promise to install 10,000 famicom disk writer kiosks in toy and hobby stores across japan within one year they are a slight modification of mitsumi 's quick disk 89 & nbsp ; mm 2.8 in square disk format which is used in a handful of japanese computers and various synthesizer keyboards , along with a few word processors the ram adapter contains 32 & nbsp ; kilobytes ( kb ) of ram for temporarily caching program data from disk , 8 & nbsp ; kb of ram for tile and sprite data storage , and an asic named the 2c33 final fantasy was to be released for the fds , but a disagreement over nintendo 's copyright policies caused square to change its position and release the game as a cartridge following several delays , the famicom disk system was released on february 21 , 1986 , at a retail price of ¥15000 ( us 80 ) by 1985 , nintendo 's family computer was dominating the japanese home video game market , selling over three million units within a year and a half to write an existing disk with a new game from the available roster was ( then about and 1/6 of the price of many new games )
