native americans mixed beans , maple sugar , and bear fat in earthenware pots which they placed in underground '' bean holes '' which were lined in hot rocks to cook slowly over a long period of time british colonists in new england were the first westerners to adopt the dish from the native peoples ; and were quick to embrace it largely because the dish was reminiscent of peas porridge and because the dish used ingredients native to the new world each colony in america had its own regional variations of the dish , with navy or white pea beans used in massachusetts , jacob 's cattle and soldier beans used in maine , and yellow-eyed beans in vermont while some historians have theorized that baked beans had originated from the cassoulet or bean stew tradition in southern france , this is unlikely as the beans used to make baked beans are all native to south america and were introduced to europe around 1528 however , it is likely that english colonists used their knowledge of cassoulet cooking to modify the cooking technique of the beans from the traditional native american version , by soaking the bean overnight and simmering the beans over a fire before baking it in earthen pots in order to decrease the cooking time the addition of onion and mustard to some baked beans recipes published in new england in the 19th century was likely based on traditional cassoulet recipes from staffordshire , england which utilized mustard , beans , and leeks originally baked beans were sweetened with maple syrup by native americans , a tradition some recipes still follow , but some english colonists modified the sweetening agent to brown sugar beginning in the 17th century in the 18th century the convention of using american made molasses as a sweetening agent became increasingly popular in order to avoid british taxes on sugar today in the new england region , baked beans are flavored either with maple syrup ( northern new england ) , or with molasses ( boston ) , and are traditionally cooked with salt pork in a beanpot in a brick oven for six to eight hours a fire would be made in a stone-lined pit and allowed to burn down to hot coals , and then a pot with 11 pounds of seasoned beans would be placed in the ashes , covered over with dirt , and left to cook overnight or longer , maine folklife center while baked beans was initially a new england region cuisine , the dish has become a popular item throughout the united states ; and is now a staple item served most frequently along various types of barbecue and at picnics over time , the recipe was altered to a less sweet tomato sauce without maple syrup , molasses , or brown sugar in order to appeal to the tastes of the united kingdom today , baked beans are a staple convenience food in the uk , often eaten as part of the modern english breakfast and particularly on toast ( called simply '' beans on toast '' ) , either in different-sized cans from those sold in the uk or in a 385-gram can ( the same can as the 415-gram can in the uk ) with an '' export '' label with american english spelling and the word '' baked '' dropped from the title on the label jersey bean crock boston baked beans pork and beans , which despite the name often contain very little pork guernsey bean jar spanish cocido montañés cassoulet ( south-western france ) feijoada fasolada frijoles charros , pinto beans cooked with bacon and sometimes tomatoes , are popular in mexico and the american border states greek fasolia gigandes gigandes plaki in the italian cuisine beans ( of various size and various types ) are widely used for several recipes also mixed with other ingredients : '' fagiolata '' generally stands for baked beans but there are also regional variations like '' fagioli all'uccelletto '' in florence ; '' minestra di fagioli '' ( beans soup normally cooked with vegetables ) '' pasta e fagioli '' ( meaning '' pasta and beans '' ) bean-hole beans , traditionally from northern new england and quebec , cooked in a covered fire pit in the ground for up to two days british cuisine ( also popular in ireland ) claims beans on toast as a teatime favourite , the combination of cereal and legume forming an inexpensive complete protein ; compare rice and beans variations of '' beans on toast deluxe '' can include extras as such as egg , grated cheese , marmite , or tuna , and baked beans sometimes form part of a full breakfast
