any more-or-less arbitrarily chosen system of axioms is the basis of some mathematical theory , but such an arbitrary axiomatic system will not necessarily be free of contradictions , and even if it is , it is not likely to shed light on anything in an axiomatic system , an axiom is called independent if it is not a theorem that can be derived from other axioms in the system a model for an axiomatic system is a well-defined set , which assigns meaning for the undefined terms presented in the system , in a manner that is correct with the relations defined in the system an axiomatic system is called complete if for every statement , either itself or its negation is derivable from the system 's axioms ( equivalently , every statement is capable of being proven true or false ) the property of categoriality ( categoricity ) ensures the completeness of a system , however the converse is not true : completeness does not ensure the categoriality ( categoricity ) of a system , since two models can differ in properties that can not be expressed by the semantics of the system an example of such a body of propositions is the theory of the natural numbers , which is only partially axiomatized by the peano axioms ( described below ) typically , the computer can recognize the axioms and logical rules for deriving theorems , and the computer can recognize whether a proof is valid , but to determine whether a proof exists for a statement is only soluble by '' waiting '' for the proof or disproof to be generated axioms ) that relate a number of primitive terms — in order that a consistent body of propositions may be derived deductively from these statements philosophers of mathematics sometimes assert that mathematicians choose axioms '' arbitrarily '' , but it is possible that although they may appear arbitrary when viewed only from the point of view of the canons of deductive logic , that appearance is due to a limitation on the purposes that deductive logic serves in recursion theory , a collection of axioms is called recursive if a computer program can recognize whether a given proposition in the language is a theorem he chose the axioms , in the language of a single unary function symbol s ( short for '' successor '' ) , for the set of natural numbers to be : there is a natural number 0 that is , it is impossible to derive both a statement and its negation from the system 's axioms in mathematics , axiomatization is the process of taking a body of knowledge and working backwards towards its axioms unlike consistency , independence is not a necessary requirement for a functioning axiomatic system — though it is usually sought after to minimize the number of axioms in the system
