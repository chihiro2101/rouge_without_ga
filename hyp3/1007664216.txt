vesuvius is recognized as one of the most dangerous volcanoes , due to its capacity for plinian eruption combined with the high population density of the surrounding metropolitan naples area ( totaling about 3.6 & nbsp ; million inhabitants ) whatever the precise mechanism , the pressure in the magma chamber increases to a critical point where the roof of the magma chamber fractures and the contents of the magma chamber are provided with a path to the surface through which to erupt in parts of europe , asia , africa and north america , 1816 was known as the '' year without a summer '' , which caused considerable agricultural crisis and a brief but bitter famine , which generated a series of distresses across much of the affected continents as per the above examples , while the unzen eruptions have caused deaths and considerable local damage in the historic past , the impact of the june 1991 eruption of mount pinatubo was global dense clouds of hot volcanic ash , caused by the collapse of an eruption column or by being laterally expelled from the partial collapse of a volcanic edifice or lava dome during explosive eruptions , can generate devastating pyroclastic flows or surges , which can sweep off everything in their paths the eruption of mount vesuvius in 79 completely smothered the nearby ancient cities of pompeii and herculaneum with thick deposits of pyroclastic surges and lava flows when anhydrous minerals such as feldspar crystallize out of the magma , this concentrates volatiles in the remaining liquid , which can lead to second boiling that causes a gas phase ( carbon dioxide or water ) to separate from the liquid magma and raise magma chamber pressures pinatubo , located in central luzon just west-northwest from manila , had been dormant for 6 centuries before the 1991 eruption , which ranks as one of the largest eruptions in the 20th century the water freed from the rock lowers the melting point of the overlying mantle rock , which then undergoes partial melting and rises due to its lighter density relative to the surrounding mantle rock , and pools temporarily at the base of the lithosphere lava flows from stratovolcanoes are generally not a significant threat to humans and animals because the highly viscous lava moves slowly enough for everyone to flee out of the path of flow possible mechanisms include : magma differentiation , in which the lightest , most silica-rich magma and volatiles such as water , halogens , and sulfur dioxide accumulate in the uppermost part of the magma chamber the so 2 mass in this cloud—about 22 million tons—combined with water ( both of volcanic and atmospheric origin ) formed droplets of sulfuric acid , blocking a portion of the sunlight from reaching the troposphere and ground for example , sector collapse ( where part of the flank of a volcano collapses in a massive landslide ) can trigger eruption only of a very shallow magma chamber fluid lavas are typically associated with the formation of broad shield volcanoes such as those of hawaii , but nyiragongo has very steep slopes down which lava can flow at up to also in 1991 , japan 's unzen volcano , located on the island of kyushu about east of nagasaki , awakened from its 200-year slumber to produce a new lava dome at its summit an eruption the size of mount pinatubo tends to affect the weather for a few years ; the material injected into the stratosphere gradually drops into the troposphere , where it is washed away by rain and cloud precipitation
