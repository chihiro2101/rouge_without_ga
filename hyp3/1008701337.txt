personal area networks , bluetooth , transferjet , ultra-wideband ( uwb from wimedia alliance ) the wireless revolution began in the 1990s , with the advent of digital wireless networks leading to a social revolution , and a paradigm shift from wired to wireless technology , including the proliferation of commercial wireless technologies such as cell phones , mobile telephony , pagers , wireless computer networks , cellular networks , the wireless internet , and laptop and handheld computers with wireless connections the wireless revolution has been driven by advances in radio frequency ( rf ) and microwave engineering , including the transition from analog to digital rf technology along with the migration to metal–oxide–semiconductor ( mos ) based multi-carrier rf power amplifiers , which enabled a substantial increase in voice traffic along with the delivery of digital data such as text messaging , images and streaming media 2013 wireless data communications are used to span a distance beyond the capabilities of typical cabling in point-to-point communication and point-to-multipoint communication , to provide a backup communications link in case of normal network failure , to link portable or temporary workstations , to overcome situations where normal cabling is difficult or financially impractical , or to remotely connect mobile users or networks another widely used example is consumer ir devices such as remote controls and irda ( infrared data association ) networking , which is used as an alternative to wifi networking to allow laptops , pdas , printers , and digital cameras to exchange data common examples of wireless equipment include : tech target – definition of wireless – posted by margaret rouse ( april 2 control and traffic control systems infrared and ultrasonic remote control devices professional lmr ( land mobile radio ) and smr ( specialized mobile radio ) typically used by business , industrial and public safety entities the frequencies of the radio spectrum that are available for use for communication are treated as a public resource and are regulated by organizations such as the american federal communications commission , ofcom in the united kingdom , the international itu-r or the european etsi cordless computer peripherals : the cordless mouse is a common example ; wireless headphones , keyboards , and printers can also be linked to a computer via wireless using technology such as wireless usb or bluetooth in 1894 , guglielmo marconi began developing a wireless telegraph system using radio waves , which had been known about since proof of their existence in 1888 by heinrich hertz , but discounted as a communication format since they seemed , at the time , to be a short range phenomenon in the absence of such control or alternative arrangements such as a privatized electromagnetic spectrum , chaos might result if , for example , airlines did not have specific frequencies to work under and an amateur radio operator was interfering with a pilot 's ability to land an aircraft one of the best-known examples of wireless technology is the mobile phone , also known as a cellular phone , with more than 6.6 & nbsp ; billion mobile cellular subscriptions worldwide as of the end of 2010 wireless energy transfer is a process whereby electrical energy is transmitted from a power source to an electrical load that does not have a built-in power source , without the use of interconnecting wires wireless networks : wireless lan ( wlan ) , ( ieee 802.11 branded as wi-fi and hiperlan ) , wireless metropolitan area networks ( wman ) and ( lmds , wimax , and hiperman ) wireless internet service : an introduction supporting technologies include : : wi-fi is a wireless local area network that enables portable computing devices to connect easily with other devices , peripheries , and the internet a number of wireless electrical signaling schemes including sending electric currents through water and the ground using electrostatic and electromagnetic induction were investigated for telegraphy in the late 19th century before practical radio systems became available for example , free space optical links are used in cities between office buildings which are not wired for networking , where the cost of running cable through the building and under the street would be prohibitive
