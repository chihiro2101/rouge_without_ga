the national botanic garden of wales displays plants from wales and from all around the world , and the carmarthenshire county museum , the national wool museum , the parc howard museum , the pendine museum of speed and the west wales museum of childhood all provide opportunities to delve into the past 489 , 497 before the romans arrived in britain , the land now forming the county of carmarthenshire was part of the kingdom of the demetae who gave their name to the county of dyfed ; it contained one of their chief settlements , moridunum , now known as carmarthen carmarthenshire has its early roots in the region formerly known as ystrad tywi ( '' vale of the river tywi '' ) and part of the kingdom of deheubarth during the high middle ages , with the court at dinefwr the county is bounded to the north by ceredigion , to the east by powys ( historic county brecknockshire ) , neath port talbot ( historic county glamorgan ) and swansea ( also glamorgan ) , to the south by the bristol channel and to the west by pembrokeshire stone tools found in coygan cave , near laugharne indicate the presence of hominins , probably neanderthals , at least 40,000 years ago , though , as in the rest of the british isles , continuous habitation by modern humans is not known before the end of the younger dryas , around 11,500 years bp the river teifi forms much of the border between carmarthenshire and ceredigion , and there are a number of towns in the teifi valley which have communities living on either side of the river and hence in different counties the lowest bridge over the river is at carmarthen , and the towi estuary cuts the southwesterly part of the county , including llansteffan and laugharne , off from the more urban southeastern region carmarthenshire has a long coastline which is deeply cut by the estuaries of the loughor in the east and the gwendraeth , tywi and taf , which enter the sea on the east side of carmarthen bay in 2014 , west wales was identified as the worst-performing region in the united kingdom along with the south wales valleys the first industrial canal in wales was built in 1768 to convey coal from the gwendraeth valley to the coast , and the following year , the earliest tramroad bridge was on the tramroad built alongside the canal under the local government act 1972 , the administrative county of carmarthenshire was abolished on 1 april 1974 and the area of carmarthenshire became three districts within the new county of dyfed : carmarthen , dinefwr and llanelli in the north of the county , in and around the teifi valley , there was a thriving woollen industry in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries the principal towns in the county are ammanford , burry port , carmarthen , kidwelly , llanelli , llandeilo , newcastle emlyn , llandovery , st clears , and whitland the highest point ( county top ) is the minor summit of fan foel , height , which is a subsidiary top of the higher mountain of fan brycheiniog , height ( the higher summit , as its name suggests , is actually across the border in brecknockshire/powys ) kidwelly had a tinning industry in the eighteenth century , with llanelli following not long after , so that by the end of the nineteenth century , llanelli was the world-centre of the industry the m4 route that links south wales with london , terminates at junction 49 , the pont abraham services , to continue northwest as the dual carriageway , and to finish with its junction with the a40 in carmarthen llanelli and burry port served at one time for the export of coal , but trade declined , as it did from the ports of kidwelly and carmarthen as their estuaries silted up the romans established two forts in south wales , one at caerwent to control the southeast of the country , and one at carmarthen to control the southwest edward i made carmarthen the capital of this new county , establishing his courts of chancery and his exchequer there , and holding the court of great sessions in wales in the town on 1 april 1974 , under the local government act 1972 , carmarthenshire joined cardiganshire and pembrokeshire in the new county of dyfed ; carmarthenshire was divided into three districts : carmarthen , llanelli and dinefwr although llanelli is by far the largest town in the county , the county town remains carmarthen , mainly due to its central location these include brechfa forest , the pembrey country park , the millennium coastal park at llanelli , the wwt llanelli wetlands centre and the carmel national nature reserve the a484 links llanelli with carmarthen by a coastal route and continues northwards to cardigan , and via the a486 and a487 to aberystwyth , and the a485 links carmarthen to lampeter in the late medieval period the county 's fortunes varied , as good and bad harvests occurred , increased taxes were levied by england , there were episodes of plague , and recruitment for wars removed the young men the black mountain range dominates the east of the county , with the lower foothills of the cambrian mountains to the north across the valley of the river towy
