according to john symonds , writing in the encyclopædia britannica eleventh edition , manutius was granted citizenship of the town of carpi on 8 march 1480 where he owned local property , and in 1482 he traveled to mirandola for a time with his longtime friend and fellow student , giovanni pico della mirandola , where he stayed two years to study greek literature pico recommended manutius to become the tutor of his nephews , alberto and leonello pio , princes of the town of carpi at the end of the 1480s , manutius published two works addressed to his two pupils and their mother , caterina pico—both works were published in venice by baptista de tortis : musarum panagyris with its epistola catherinae piae ( march/may 1487 to march 1491 ) and the paraenesis ( 1490 ) torresani and manutius became lifelong business partners , and for their first contract together manutius hired torresani to print the first edition of his latin grammar book the institutiones grammaticae , published on 9 march 1493 of torresani 's fifty percent , manutius was given one-fifth , but accounts are unclear as to whether manutius 's one-fifth refers to ten percent of the aldine press or ownership exclusively to one-fifth of torresani 's share during that time , desiderius erasmus asked manutius to publish his translations of hecuba and iphigenia in aulis through the aldine press in december 1507 , the aldine press published iphigenia in aulis in an 80-page octavo with erasmus 's translation from greek into latin manutius reappeared in 1513 with an edition of plato that he dedicated to pope leo x in a preface that compares the miseries of warfare and the woes of italy with the sublime and tranquil objects of the student 's life only four italian towns were authorized to produce greek publications : milan , venice , vicenza , and florence , and they only published works by theocritus , isocrates , and homer '' he originally came to venice because of its many greek resources ; venice held greek manuscripts from the time of constantinople and was home to a large cluster of greek scholars who traveled there from crete the encyclopædia britannica eleventh edition writes that the new academy 's '' rules were written in greek , its members spoke greek , their names were hellenized , and their official titles were greek instructions for typesetters and binders were written in greek , and the prefaces to manutius 's editions were also in greek manutius launched pietro bembo 's career as a writer by publishing de aetna in 1496 , which was the aldine press 's first latin publication by a contemporary author enchiridion , described in a legacy more lasting than bronze , also refers to a handheld weapon , a hint that aldus intended the books in his portable library to be the weapons of scholars the aldine press removed these inconveniences ; manutius 's books were '' published without commentary and in smaller sizes , usually octavos of five by eight or four by six inches in the new aldine studies , harry george fletcher iii , pierpont morgan library 's curator for printed books and bindings , writes that manutius intended '' to make available in type a face comfortable for its readers '' with the cursive typeface the handwriting reproduced for the many aldine press typefaces is a topic of conflicting opinions by scholars ; symonds ( 1911 ) suggests petrarch 's handwriting , while the new aldine studies presumes the handwriting of scribes pomponio leto and bartolomeo sanvito was the inspiration for the typeface manutius and griffo 's original typeface is the first known model of italic type and was used by manutius until 1501 the 1502 publication of the metamorphoses included manutius 's privilege from the doge of venice indicating that any use or imitation of manutius 's greek and italic typefaces was forbidden despite trying to have the typeface protected legally , manutius could not stop printers outside of venice from using his work , which led to the typeface 's popularity outside of italy manutius attempted to discourage piracy with blunt warnings at the end of his publications , as in sylvarum libri quinque , by publius papinius statius , where he warned '' no one is allowed to print this without penalty and deceived unwary buyers due to the similarity of typography and format.furthermore , the paper is of poor quality and has a heavy odor , and the typography , if you examine it closely , exudes a sort of ( as one might phrase it ) 'frenchiness ' '' the woodcut images '' included aspects of both continuity and discontinuity that involved the activity of manutius , who was called upon to wholly explicate the new potential of the printed book and deal with the crisis of the illumination in the preface of ovid 's metamorphoses ( 1502 ) , he argues that heroides 17 , 19 , and 21 ( the letters of helen , hero , and cudippe , respectively ) were the work of the poet sabinus , whom ovid refers to as amores he died the next month , 6 february , and '' with his death the importance of italy as a seminal and dynamic force in printing came to an end '' torresani and his two sons carried on the business during the youth of manutius 's children , and eventually paulus , manutius 's son , took over the business the publishing symbol and motto were never wholly abandoned by the aldine press until the expiration of their firm in its third generation of operation by aldus manutius the younger however , before his death manutius had begun an edition of the septuagint , also known as the greek old testament translated from hebrew , the first ever to be published ; it aldine bible grendler wrote , '' aldus ensured the survival of a large number of ancient texts and greatly facilitated the diffusion of the values , enthusiasms , and scholarship of italian renaissance humanism to the rest of europe '' erasmus was impressed by manutius ; '' in a long passage he extols the 'tireless efforts ' of manutius in restoring ancient learning , truly ' a herculean task , ' and he announces that 'aldus is building up a library which has no other limits than the world itself ' one of the novel 's characters , griffo gerritszoon , designs a fictitious font called '' gerritszoon '' that is preinstalled on every mac , in allusion to manutius 's associate francesco griffo , the designer of italic type the aldus corporation , a software company founded in seattle in 1985 known for pagemaker and freehand , was named after manutius and used his profile as part of their company logo 1501 epitome of the eight parts of speech , lascaris , 1495 organon , aristotle , 1495 grammar , theodorus gaza , 1495 idylls , theocritus , 1495–1496 thesaurus , corn of amalthea and gardens of adones , 1496 historia plantarum , theophrastus , 1497 dictionarium graecum , i bolzanius , 1497/1498 physics , aristotle , 1497 history of animals , aristotle , 1497 prolegomena to the deipnosophists , athenaeus , 1498 nicomachean ethics , aristotle , 1498 nine comedies , aristophanes , 1498 catalogues of aldus 's editions epistolae diversorum philosophorum oratorum , 1499 phaenomena , aratus , 1499 metabole paraphrase of john , nonnus of panopolis , 1501 bibbia , 1501 poetae christiani veteres , first volume , 1501 poetae christiani veteres , second volume , 1502 de octo partibus orationis , constantine lascaris , 1501–1503 de urbibus , stephanus byzantius , 1502 onomasticon , julius pollux , 1502 history of the peloponnesian war , thucydides , 1502 tragedies , sophocles , 1502 complete works , lucian , 1503 de interpretatione , ammonius hermiae , 1503 prolegomena , ulpian , 1503 anthology of epigrams , m lascaris , 1512 pindar , 1513 orators ' speeches , 1513 greek orators , 1513 complete works , plato , 1513 commentary on the topics of aristotle , alexander of aphrodisias , 1513/1514 suda , 1514 lexikon , hesychius , 1514 deipnosophists , athenaeus , 1514 grammar , aldus manutius , 1515 , ovid ( december 1502 ) fasti , tristia , ex ponto , ovid ( february 1503 ) homilies , origen ( after 4 april 1503 ) vergil ( december 1505 ) letters , pliny the younger ( november 1508 ) horace ( after 30 march 1509 ) sallust ( april 1509 ) letters to atticus , brutus and his brother quintus , cicero ( june 1513 ) on the meaning of archaic words , festus ( june 1513 ) julius caesar ( december 1513 ) rhetorical works , cicero ( march 1514 ) on agriculture , cato , varro , columella , palladius ( may 1514 ) quintilian ( august 1514 ) vergil ( october 1514 ) lucretius ( january 1515 ) partial list of humanist authors translated and published by the aldine press under manutius 's supervision : instructional principles of latin grammar , aldus manutius ( 5 march 1493 ) gleanings in dialectics , lorenzo maioli ( july 1497 ) complete works , angelo poliziano ( july 1498 ) cornucopiae , niccolò perotti ( july 1499 ) rudiments of latin grammar , aldus manutius ( february–june 1501 ) on imagination , gianfrancesco pico ( april 1501 ) the land and customs of the zygians call circassians , giorgio interiano ( october 1502 ) urania , meteora , the gardens of the hesperides , etc
