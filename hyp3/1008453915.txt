alopecia areata most often affects the scalp and beard , but may occur on any part of the body with hair the hair tends to fall out over a short period of time , with the loss commonly occurring more on one side of the scalp than the other when healthy hair is pulled out , at most a few should come out , and ripped hair should not be distributed evenly across the tugged portion of the scalp in cases of alopecia areata , hair tends to pull out more easily along the edge of the patch where the follicles are already being attacked by the body 's immune system than away from the patch where they are still healthy alopecia areata is thought to be a systemic autoimmune disorder in which the body attacks its own anagen hair follicles and suppresses or stops hair growth the genes that were identified include those involved in controlling the activation and proliferation of regulatory t cells , cytotoxic t lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 , interleukin-2 , interleukin-2 receptor a , and eos ( also known as ikaros family zinc finger 4 ) , as well as the human leukocyte antigen . hair may also be lost more diffusely over the whole scalp , in which case the condition is called diffuse alopecia areata if the person loses all the hair on the scalp , the disease is then called alopecia areata totalis the objective assessment of treatment efficacy is very difficult and spontaneous remission is unpredictable , but if the affected area is patched , the hair may regrow spontaneously in many cases steroid injections are commonly used in sites where the areas of hair loss on the head are small or especially where eyebrow hair has been lost some other medications that have been used are minoxidil , elocon ( mometasone ) ointment ( steroid cream ) , irritants ( anthralin or topical coal tar ) , and topical immunotherapy ciclosporin , sometimes in different combinations when alopecia areata is associated with celiac disease , treatment with a gluten-free diet allows for complete and permanent regrowth of scalp and other body hair in many people , but in others , remissions and recurrences are seen in cases with a greater number of patches , hair can either grow back or progress to alopecia areata totalis or , in rare cases , alopecia areata universalis no loss of body function occurs , and the effects of alopecia areata are psychological ( loss of self-image due to hair loss ) , although these can be severe the condition affects 0.1 % â€“0.2 % of the population , and occurs equally in both males and females in 2014 , preliminary findings showing that oral ruxolitinib , a drug approved by the us food and drug administration ( fda ) for bone marrow disorder myelofibrosis , restored hair growth in three individuals with long-standing and severe disease alopecia areata and alopecia barbae have been identified by some as the biblical condition that is part of the greater family of skin disorders ; the said disorders are purported to being discussed in the book of leviticus , chapter 13
