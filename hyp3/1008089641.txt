the existing variations in the basic accounts of al-farabi 's origins and pedigree indicate that they were not recorded during his lifetime or soon thereafter by anyone with concrete information , but were based on hearsay or guesses ( as is the case with other contemporaries of al-farabi ) from incidental accounts it is known that he spent significant time ( most of his life ) in baghdad with christian scholars including the cleric yuhanna ibn haylan , yahya ibn adi , and abu ishaq ibrahim al-baghdadi his grandfather was not known among his contemporaries , but a name , awzalaḡ , suddenly appears later in the writings of ibn abi osaybe ' a , and of his great-grandfather in those of ibn khallikan thus , there are many places that carry the name ( or various evolutions of that hydrological/geological toponym ) in that general area , such as otrar on the jaxartes ( syr darya ) in modern kazakhstan , fārāb ( modern türkmenabat ) on the oxus amu darya in turkmenistan , or fāryāb in greater khorasan ( modern day afghanistan ) pg 134 : '' ibn nadim in his al-fihrist , which is the first work to mention farabi considers him to be of persian origin , as does muhammad

completed in 669/1271 ) states that farabi was born in the small village of wasij near fārāb ( in what is today otrar , kazakhstan ) of turkic parents gafurov , central asia : pre-historic to

'' 5 dimitri gutas , an american arabist of greek origin , criticizes this , saying that ibn khallikān 's account is aimed at the earlier historical accounts by ibn abi osaybe ' a , and serves the purpose to '' prove '' a turkic origin for al-farabi , for instance by mentioning the additional nisba ( surname ) '' al-turk '' ( arab al-masudi , writing barely five years after the fact ( 955-6 , the date of the composition of the tanbīh ) , says that farabi died in damascus in rajab 339 ( between 14 december 950 and 12 january 951 ) he discussed the topics of future contingents , the number and relation of the categories , the relation between logic and grammar , and non-aristotelian forms of inference he is also credited with categorizing logic into two separate groups , the first being '' idea '' and the second being '' proof '' he also wrote a treatise on the meanings of the intellect , which dealt with music therapy and discussed the therapy effects of music on the soul as a philosopher , al-farabi was a founder of his own school of early islamic philosophy known as '' farabism '' or '' alfarabism '' , though it was later overshadowed by avicennism moves from metaphysics to methodology , a move that anticipates modernity '' , and '' at the level of philosophy , alfarabi unites theory and practice al-farabi had great influence on science and philosophy for several centuries , and was widely considered second only to aristotle in knowledge ( alluded to by his title of '' the second teacher '' ) in his time al-farabi also wrote a commentary on aristotle 's work , and one of his most notable works is al-madina al-fadila where he theorized an ideal state as in plato 's the republic arabic and islamic natural philosophy and natural science , stanford encyclopedia of philosophy al-farabi argued that religion rendered truth through symbols and persuasion , and , like plato , saw it as the duty of the philosopher to provide guidance to the state al-farabi incorporated the platonic view , drawing a parallel from within the islamic context , in that he regarded the ideal state to be ruled by the prophet-imam , instead of the philosopher-king envisaged by plato al-farabi argued that the ideal state was the city-state of medina when it was governed by the prophet muhammad as its head of state , as he was in direct communion with allah whose law was revealed to him in the absence of the prophet-imam , al-farabi considered democracy as the closest to the ideal state , regarding the republican order of the sunni rashidun caliphate as an example within early muslim history however , he also maintained that it was from democracy that imperfect states emerged , noting how the republican order of the early islamic caliphate of the rashidun caliphs was later replaced by a form of government resembling a monarchy under the umayyad and abbasid dynasties al-farabi wrote social psychology and principles of the opinions of the citizens of the virtuous city , which were the first treatises to deal with social psychology he stated that '' an isolated individual could not achieve all the perfections by himself , without the aid of other individuals , '' and that it is the '' innate disposition of every man to join another human being or other men in the labor he ought to perform '' amber haque ( 2004 ) , '' psychology from islamic perspective : contributions of early muslim scholars and challenges to contemporary muslim psychologists '' , journal of religion and health 43 ( 4 ) : 357–377 363 in his treatise on the cause of dreams , which appeared as chapter 24 of his principles of the opinions of the citizens of the ideal city , he distinguished between dream interpretation and the nature and causes of dreams amongst these are a number of prolegomena to philosophy , commentaries on important aristotelian works ( such as the nicomachean ethics ) as well as his own works some other significant influences on his work were the planetary model of ptolemy and elements of neo-platonism , motahhari , mortaza , becoming familiar with islamic knowledge , v1 , p:162 particularly metaphysics and practical ( or political ) philosophy ( which bears more resemblance to plato 's republic than aristotle 's politics ) in the handing down of aristotle ’ s thought to the christian west in the middle ages , al-farabi played an essential part as appears in the translation of farabi ’ s commentary and short treatise on aristotle ’ s de interpretatione that f.w in a wonderfully concise way , the work treats of the essentials of aristotelian logic in the light of comments made by the persian philosophers : avicenna and , above all , al-farabi however , he tried to gather the ideas of plato and aristotle in his book '' the gathering of the ideas of the two philosophers '' his success should be measured by the honorific title of '' the second master '' of philosophy ( aristotle being the first ) , by which he was known in contrast to al-kindi , who considered the subject of metaphysics to be god , al-farabi believed that it was concerned primarily with being qua being ( that is , being in and of itself ) , and this is related to god only to the extent that god is a principle of absolute being al-kindi 's view was , however , a common misconception regarding greek philosophy amongst muslim intellectuals at the time , and it was for this reason that avicenna remarked that he did not understand aristotle 's metaphysics properly until he had read a prolegomenon written by al-farabi reisman , p56 in his model , the universe is viewed as a number of concentric circles ; the outermost sphere or '' first heaven '' , the sphere of fixed stars , saturn , jupiter , mars , the sun , venus , mercury and finally , the moon black , p189 each of these circles represent the domain of the secondary intelligences ( symbolized by the celestial bodies themselves ) , which act as causal intermediaries between the first cause ( in this case , god ) and the material world the first cause , by thinking of itself , '' overflows '' and the incorporeal entity of the second intellect '' emanates '' from it like its predecessor , the second intellect also thinks about itself , and thereby brings its celestial sphere ( in this case , the sphere of fixed stars ) into being , but in addition to this it must also contemplate upon the first cause , and this causes the '' emanation '' of the next intellect therefore if one was to define the first cause , each of the terms used would actually constitute a part of its substance and therefore behave as a cause for its existence , which is impossible as the first cause is uncaused ; it exists without being caused human beings are unique in al-farabi 's vision of the universe because they stand between two worlds : the '' higher '' , immaterial world of the celestial intellects and universal intelligibles , and the '' lower '' , material world of generation and decay ; they inhabit a physical body , and so belong to the '' lower '' world , but they also have a rational capacity , which connects them to the '' higher '' realm the first three are the different states of the human intellect and the fourth is the tenth intellect ( the moon ) in his emanational cosmology reisman , p64 this illumination removes all accident ( such as time , place , quality ) and physicality from them , converting them into primary intelligibles , which are logical principles such as '' the whole is greater than the part '' the human intellect , by its act of intellection , passes from potentiality to actuality , and as it gradually comprehends these intelligibles , it is identified with them ( as according to aristotle , by knowing something , the intellect becomes like it ) reisman , p63 because the agent intellect knows all of the intelligibles , this means that when the human intellect knows all of them , it becomes associated with the agent intellect 's perfection and is known as the acquired intellect any individual or distinguishing features of the soul are annihilated after the death of the body ; only the rational faculty survives ( and then , only if it has attained perfection ) , which becomes one with all other rational souls within the agent intellect and enters a realm of pure intelligence corbin , p165 however , deborah black mentions we have cause to be skeptical as to whether this was the mature and developed view of al-farabi , as later thinkers such as ibn tufayl , averroes and ibn bajjah would assert that he repudiated this view in his commentary on the nicomachean ethics , which has been lost to modern experts he says it is composed of four faculties : the appetitive ( the desire for , or aversion to an object of sense ) , the sensitive ( the perception by the senses of corporeal substances ) , the imaginative ( the faculty which retains images of sensible objects after they have been perceived , and then separates and combines them for a number of ends ) , and the rational , which is the faculty of intellection this extends the representative ability of the imagination beyond sensible forms and to include temperaments , emotions , desires and even immaterial intelligibles or abstract universals , as happens when , for example , one associates '' evil '' with '' darkness '' black ( b ) , p313 black , p185 the prophet , in addition to his own intellectual capacity , has a very strong imaginative faculty , which allows him to receive an overflow of intelligibles from the agent intellect ( the tenth intellect in the emanational cosmology ) the practical application of philosophy was a major concern expressed by al-farabi in many of his works , and while the majority of his philosophical output has been influenced by aristotelian thought , his practical philosophy was unmistakably based on that of plato the ideal society , he wrote , is one directed towards the realization of '' true happiness '' ( which can be taken to mean philosophical enlightenment ) and as such , the ideal philosopher must hone all the necessary arts of rhetoric and poetics to communicate abstract truths to the ordinary people , as well as having achieved enlightenment himself black , p190 al-farabi compared the philosopher 's role in relation to society with a physician in relation to the body ; the body 's health is affected by the '' balance of its humours '' just as the city is determined by the moral habits of its people the philosopher 's duty , he wrote , was to establish a '' virtuous '' society by healing the souls of the people , establishing justice and guiding them towards '' true happiness '' corbin , p162-163 on the other hand , charles butterworth contends that nowhere in his work does al-farabi speak of a prophet-legislator or revelation ( even the word philosophy is scarcely mentioned ) , and the main discussion that takes place concerns the positions of '' king '' and '' statesmen ''
