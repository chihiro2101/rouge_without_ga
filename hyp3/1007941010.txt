regarded as obsolete by 1911 , she was relegated for use as a gunnery target to allow the navy to evaluate the effects of modern shells on armored and unarmored parts of the ship , the probabilities of underwater hits and their depths , the effects of shock loads on pipes , etc though her primary field of operations once again centered on the northeastern coast , she also made periodic visits to such places as san juan , puerto rico , and havana , cuba , where her crew could view some of the results of their own ship 's efforts in the recent war the delivery of the in 1883 and the acquisition of other armored warships by brazil , argentina , and chile shortly afterward alarmed the united states government , as the brazilian navy was now the most powerful in the western hemisphere furthermore , neither the deck nor the superstructure was reinforced to withstand the muzzle blast as the gun fired , as demonstrated during the battle of santiago de cuba when her starboard deck was damaged the other , armed with two guns , became texas , the first ship named in honor of that state to be built by the united states '' on 15 february 1911 , her name was changed to san marcos to allow the name texas to be assigned to uss texas ( bb-35 ) these two incidents gave her a reputation as being a jinxed or unlucky ship and earned her the nickname '' old hoodoo '' leaks in the watertight doors , voicepipes and holes in the bulkheads for electrical cables allowed the flooding to spread to the other engine and boiler rooms , the coal bunkers adjacent to them , as well as most of the magazines and shell rooms they were both optimized for end-on fire and had their gun turrets sponsoned out over the sides of the ship and echeloned to allow them to fire across the deck , much like the battleships riachuelo and as part of this evaluation , she was fully fitted out and only items which normally would have been allowed to be removed before action and those items added to her for service as a station ship were removed '' a cage mast , a duplicate of those used on the dreadnoughts , was built atop the san marcoss remains in 1912 and tested against shells fired by the monitor from a range of on 21 august 1912 early in the spring , war between the united states and spain erupted over conditions in cuba and the supposed spanish destruction of the battleship in havana harbor in february 1898 she was originally intended to carry two small steam torpedo boats , each with a one-pounder gun , and a trainable torpedo tube , but they were cancelled after the poor performance of the boat built for the maine tons of explosives were used to demolish her upperworks and drive her hull deep into the mud ; by january 1959 , they were successful and she remains there today '' texas was lightly damaged during the battle by a single high explosive shell that hit her on the starboard side above the main deck , immediately forward of the ash hoist even five years before texas was complete , the blast effects from end-on fire were considered prohibitive and en echelon mounting of main guns was abandoned in european navies '' the navy advisory board , confronted with the possibility of hostile ironclads operating off the american coast , began planning for a pair of ships to protect that coast in 1884 '' she was sunk in shallow water in tangier sound in chesapeake bay on 21–22 march 1911 by gunfire from the battleship at the beginning of 1898 , she visited key west , florida , and the dry tortugas en route to galveston for a return visit , which she made in mid-february initially , they could only be loaded at one positions , dead-ahead and at 0° elevation , but they were modified to load at all angles of train just before the start of the spanish–american war herbert characterized the situation thus : '' if all this old navy of ours were drawn up in battle array in mid-ocean and confronted by the riachuelo it is doubtful whether a single vessel bearing the american flag would get into port while the battleship 's main battery pounded the armored cruisers and , her secondary battery joined , , and in battering two torpedo-boat destroyers in february 1897 , she left the atlantic for a brief cruise to the gulf coast ports of galveston , texas , and new orleans four of the six guns were mounted in casemates in the hull and the other two were mounted on the main deck in open pivot positions no detailed examination was made afterward , but it was noted that there were so many holes below the waterline that the water in the forward and rear compartments generally took on the motion of the outside water the ship settled to the bottom , but the water was so shallow as to aid salvage efforts san marcos was used for gunnery practice throughout world war ii , although generally as an anchor for a canvas target screen along the center of the ship , they were one inch thick , but increased to two inches closer to the sides of the ship the lateral hydraulic pipes that ran along the underside of the gun deck were initially unprotected , but armored tubes were installed to protect them during texass 1902 refit sitting two to six feet below the surface and marked by an unlit buoy , she was responsible for the sinking of the cargo ship lexington in 1940 following a collision after repairs texas was assigned to the north atlantic squadron , and patrolled the eastern seaboard of the united states her double bottom protected most of her hull and extended up the side to the lower edge of the armor deck
