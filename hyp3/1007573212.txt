1992/93 hc 383 ( select committee on members interests ) other things being equal , government borrowing tends to rise in recessions because of extra spending on benefits and because less money is being received from taxes ; lower inflation lessens the extent to which taxpayers are pulled into higher tax brackets ( fiscal drag ) in a letter to the chairman of the house of commons treasury select committee in october 1992 , lamont set out a new basis for the conduct of monetary policy centred on inflation targeting in assessing progress toward meeting the inflation target , there was a target for the growth of narrow money ( m0 ) and monitoring ranges for the growth of broad money ( m4 ) after the 2009 budget , the sunday times editorialised that lamont 's budget had been so badly received that he was out of his job within two months , '' but it fixed the public finances and set up the prosperity of the 1990s and beyond '' and derek scott , tony blair 's economic adviser from 1997 to 2003 , wrote that lamont was '' rightly praised '' for putting in place the post-erm framework , that stage of lamont 's career being '' due for rerating since , in addition to designing a proper framework for monetary policy ( later consolidated by bank of england independence in 1997 ) , he also took most of the tough decisions on spending and tax to put the public finances on the road to recovery during the newbury by-election in may 1993 , lamont was asked at a press conference whether he most regretted claiming to see '' the green shoots of recovery '' or '' singing in his bath '' when called to defend him on newsnight his friend the former labour mp woodrow wyatt caused further merriment by claiming that lamont could do an excellent impersonation of a scops-owl ( whose cry , lamont later explained , '' sounds like a tennis ball emitter '' ) norman lamont , in office , little , brown and company ( 1999 ) , p three weeks after the government 's massive loss in the by-election , on 27 may 1993 , lamont was sacked ( technically resigning from the government because he declined a demotion to become secretary of state for the environment ) , throwing ( by his own account ) major 's letter of regret at his departure unopened into the wastepaper basket , and giving a resignation speech in the house of commons on 9 june , that made clear his feeling that he had been unfairly treated , saying that the government 'gives the impression of being in office but not in power ' ;
