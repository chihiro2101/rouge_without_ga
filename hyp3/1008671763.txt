at the time of montreal 's founding in 1642 most of the land stretching past mount royal to the northwest was a vast forest running the length of a long , narrow ridge known as the saint jacques escarpment in may 1912 , the décarie boulevard was officially designated , running north–south from cote-des-neiges and the town of mount royal in the north to saint-henri and cote-st-paul in the south ( a section of the road was already known as décarie avenue ) in 1908 , the first tramway made its appearance in notre-dame-de-grâce , running around the north side of mount royal from snowdon station to the intersection of mount royal and parc avenues the highway construction forced the displacement of 285 families and had a major impact on the neighbourhood , severing the easternmost part from the whole and leading to the area being referred to as 'westmount-adjacent ' ( a term implying housing costs and lifestyles more on par with westmount , one of the most affluent communities in north america , rather than ndg which as a whole is more middle class ) notre-dame-de-grâce is bounded on the east by the border with westmount and cote-des-neiges , the south by the falaise saint-jacques , and the north by côte-saint-luc road , extending west to the border with montreal west the cityscape and history of the community is rooted firmly in ndg 's role as a home for an upwardly-mobile french canadian middle class that developed much of the land roughly between confederation and the first world war it is a predominantly residential neighbourhood with considerable appeal to a wide variety of montrealers , owing principally to its local cultural cachet , proximity to the urban core of the city , and wide variety of commercial and public services the eastern part of notre-dame-de-grâce is itself split in two parts by the decarie expressway ( running north–south ) , which was built in the late 1950s and resulted in the destruction of many hundreds of homes the eastern ward is focused around the parish church at the intersection of decarie and notre-dame-de-grâce avenue , with many of the neighbourhood 's oldest buildings being found nearby generally speaking ndg is associated with montreal 's multi-ethnic middle-class anglophone community , given the presence of major anglophone institutions like loyola college of concordia university and the muhc super-hospital , but despite this association the majority of residents are fully bilingual in french and english and speak both on a regular , if not daily , basis there is also a sizeable afro-canadian and immigrant community , concentrated mostly around the parts of the district north of somerled avenue as well as south of sherbrooke street , and a 'little italy ' located south of the canadian pacific line , colloquially referred to as saint raymond the land is divided , as is traditional in quebec , in long narrow strips , an evolution of the seigneurial system of new france of the province 's colonial era the housing and surrounding landscaping was rehabilitated in the early 2000s , with new low-cost housing and additional public facilities built , such as the benny farm clsc ( a community center with many social services including a clinic run by the provincial health ministry ) as an example , the sliver of ndg running between the rail line and the saint-jacques escarpment ( from cavendish boulevard to the décarie expressway ) is known as st another section , separated from the rest of ndg by a highway trench and sharing a border with westmount , is closer to where the village of notre-dame-de-grâce was founded , and as such is occasionally referred to as 'old ndg ' ndg first rose to prominence as an important middle-class suburb towards the end of the 19th century , initially populated by the ( then ) new white-collar workforce of the canadian metropolis and accessible via tramways running to and from the city center as widespread suburbanization developed in the post-ww2 period , ndg became home to successive waves of immigrants , first from eastern europe ( including a sizeable jewish population ) , then from the caribbean , and more recently from africa , the middle east , and southeast asia concurrently , anglophone montrealers consolidated in the west end broadly speaking , with montreal 's irish and black communities shifting away from their traditional neighborhoods ( griffintown and little burgundy respectively ) and taking a more prominent position within the demographics of the area the multitude of services , including parks and other green spaces , schools , clinics , and major institutions , make it an ideal neighborhood to raise a family close to the center of the city of montreal and its central business district additionally , ndg is well-served by public transit , including numerous bus lines , two métro , and two commuter train stations , allowing the area to be one of the most 'walkable ' in the entire city founded in 2011 , the senior men 's side featured in the provincial finals in 2011 , losing to westmount in the semi-final , and again in 2012 winning the division c league and cup
