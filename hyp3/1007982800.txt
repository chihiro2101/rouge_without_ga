by studying the refracted and scattered seismic waves , the scientists produced an image of the uppermost ( top few km ) of the volcano to understand the geometry of its '' plumbing '' and how the magma rises to the lava lake dante was designed to acquire gas samples from the magma lake inside the inner crater of mount erebus to understand the chemistry better through the use of the on-board gas chromatograph , as well as measuring the temperature inside the volcano and the radioactivity of the materials present in such volcanoes the volcano is scientifically remarkable in that its relatively low-level and unusually persistent eruptive activity enables long-term volcanological study of a strombolian eruptive system very close ( hundreds of metres ) to the active vents , a characteristic shared with only a few volcanoes on earth , such as stromboli in italy a picture from space of the lava lake at the summit of mount erebus erebus glacier tongue a panoramic view from the summit of mount erebus footage of mount erebus erupting in 2005 by polar explorer sir james clark ross on ross expedition , who named it and its companion , mount terror , after his ships , hms erebus and hms terror ( which were later used by sir john franklin on his disastrous arctic expedition ) named craters located on mount erebus include side crater , a nearly circular crater named for its location on the side of the main summit cone , and western crater , named for the slope on which it sits royal commission report , para 28 the mountain directly ahead was lit by sunlight shining from directly behind the aircraft through the cloud deck above , resulting in a lack of shadows that made mount erebus effectively invisible against the overcast sky beyond in a classic whiteout ( more accurately , '' flat-light '' ) phenomenon ; general the mount erebus volcano observatory ( includes live camera images of the volcano 's lava lake , video clips of eruptions , and other information ) royal commission report , para 40 ( a ) further investigation of the crash showed an air new zealand navigational error and a cover-up that resulted in about 100 million in lawsuits mount erebus was discovered on january 27 , 1841 ( and observed to be in eruption ) , ross , voyage to the southern seas , vol mount erebus is currently the most active volcano in antarctica and is the current eruptive zone of the erebus hotspot two of the camp sites they used have been recognised for their historic significance : upper “ summit camp ” site ( hsm 89 ) consists of part of a circle of rocks , which were probably used to weight the tent valances on the northwest upper slope of the active cone near a former exploration camp site , lava flow has formed a prominent outcropping called nausea knob , named for the nausea caused by elevation sickness mount erebus ' summit crater rim was first achieved by members of sir ernest shackleton 's party ; edgeworth david , douglas mawson , alistair mackay , jameson adams , eric marshall and phillip brocklehurst ( who did not reach the summit ) , in 1908 researchers spent more than three months during the 2007–08 field season installing an atypically dense array of seismometers around mount erebus to listen to waves of energy generated by small , controlled blasts from explosives they buried along its flanks and perimeter , and to record scattered seismic signals generated by lava lake eruptions and local ice quakes the composition of the current eruptive products of erebus are anorthoclase-porphyritic tephritic phonolite and phonolite , which are the bulk of exposed lava flow on the volcano in the center of the summit caldera is a small , steep-sided cone composed primarily of decomposed lava bombs and a large deposit of anorthoclase crystals known as erebus crystals
