the apparently constant surveillance of the prison inmates by the panopticon manager and the occasional observation of the manager by the general public was to solve the age old philosophic question : '' who guards the guards ? '' bentham continued to develop the panopticon concept , as industrialisation advanced in england and an increasing number of workers were required to work in ever larger factories in their 2004 book welcome to the machine : science , surveillance , and the culture of control , derrick jensen and george draffan called bentham '' one of the pioneers of modern surveillance '' and argued that his panopticon prison design serves as the model for modern supermax prisons , such as pelican bay state prison in california with reference to the big brother television shows of endemol entertainment , in which a group of people live in a container studio apartment and allow themselves to be recorded constantly , weibel argued that the panopticon provides the masses with '' the pleasure of power , the pleasure of sadism , voyeurism , exhibitionism , scopophilia , and narcissism '' in a 2009 paper by max haiven and scott stoneman entitled walmart : the panopticon of time and the 2014 book by simon head mindless : why smarter machines are making dumber humans , which describes conditions at an amazon depot in augsburg , it is argued that catering at all times to the desires of the customer can lead to increasingly oppressive corporate environments and quotas in which many warehouse workers can no longer keep up with demands of management in 1990 , mike davis reviewed the design and operation of a shopping mall , with its centralised control room , cctv cameras and security guards , and came to the conclusion that it '' plagiarizes brazenly from jeremy bentham 's renowned nineteenth-century design '' according to professor donald preziosi , the panopticon prison of bentham resonates with the memory theatre of giulio camillo , where the sitting observer is at the centre and the phenomena are categorised in an array , which makes comparison , distinction , contrast and variation legible he argued that discipline had replaced the pre-modern society of kings , and that the panopticon should not be understood as a building , but as a mechanism of power and a diagram of political technology in the late 1960s , the american historian gertrude himmelfarb , who had published the haunted house of jeremy bentham in 1965 , was at the forefront of depicting bentham 's mechanism of surveillance as a tool of oppression and social control foucault argued that discipline had crossed the technological threshold already in the late 18th century , when the right to observe and accumulate knowledge had been extended from the prison to hospitals , schools , and later factories in the electronic eye : the rise of surveillance society ( 1994 ) the sociologist david lyon concluded that '' no single metaphor or model is adequate to the task of summing up what is central to contemporary surveillance , but important clues are available in nineteen eighty-four and in bentham 's panopticon '' fuchs draws attention to the fact that use of such platforms requires identification , classification and assessment of users by the platforms and therefore , he argues , the definition of privacy must be reassessed to incorporate stronger consumer protection and protection of citizens from corporate surveillance he argued that the disciplinary society had emerged in the 18th century and that discipline are techniques for assuring the ordering of human complexities , with the ultimate aim of docility and utility in the system doctor who , the deadly assassin , season 14 , serial 3 ; november 1976 in 1981 the novella chronicle of a death foretold by gabriel garcía márquez on the murder of santiago nasar , chapter four is written with a view on the characters through the panopticon prison of riohacha it was largely because of his sense of injustice and frustration that he developed his ideas of sinister interest – that is , of the vested interests of the powerful conspiring against a wider public interest – which underpinned many of his broader arguments for reform in 1981 the sociologist anthony giddens expressed scepticism about the ongoing surveillance debate , criticising that '' foucault 's 'archaeology ' , in which human beings do not make their own history but are swept along by it , does not adequately acknowledge that those subject to the power & nbsp ; deleuze observed that technology had allowed physical enclosures , such as schools , factories , prisons and office buildings , to be replaced by a self-governing machine , which extends surveillance in a quest to manage production and consumption bentham reasoned that if the prisoners of the panopticon prison could be seen but never knew when they were watched , the prisoners would need to follow the rules david john manning published the mind of jeremy bentham in 1986 , in which he reasoned that bentham 's fear of instability caused him to advocate ruthless social engineering and a society in which there could be no privacy or tolerance for the deviant the hawthorne effect ( 1924–1933 ) and a significant number of subsequent empirical studies led to the reinterpretation of alienation : instead of being a given power relationship between the worker and management , it came to be seen as hindering progress and modernity she accused bentham of forgetting the dangers of unrestrained power and argued that '' in his ardour for reform , bentham prepared the way for what he feared '' but in 2002 peter weibel noted that the entertainment industry does not consider the panopticon as a threat or punishment , but as '' amusement , liberation and pleasure '' in 1785 , jeremy bentham , an english social reformer and founder of utilitarianism , travelled to krychaw in white russia ( modern belarus ) to visit his brother , samuel , who accompanied prince potemkin in the 1998 satirical science fiction film the truman show , the protagonist eventually escapes the omnicam ecosphere , the reality television show that , unknown to him , broadcasts his life around the clock and across the globe bentham thought that the chief mechanism that would bring the manager of the panopticon prison in line with the duty to be humane would be publicity
