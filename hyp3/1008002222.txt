at the beginning of horace 's satire 2.3 , and the mask in the saturnalia imagery of the calendar of philocalus , and martial 's inclusion of masks as saturnalia gifts no theatrical events are mentioned in connection with the festivities , but the classicist erich segal saw roman comedy , with its cast of impudent , free-wheeling slaves and libertine seniors , as imbued with the saturnalian spirit its proximity to the winter solstice ( 21 to 23 december on the julian calendar ) was endowed with various meanings by both ancient and modern scholars : for instance , the widespread use of wax candles ( cerei , singular cereus ) could refer to '' the returning power of the sun 's light after the solstice '' in his many poems about the saturnalia , martial names both expensive and quite cheap gifts , including writing tablets , dice , knucklebones , moneyboxes , combs , toothpicks , a hat , a hunting knife , an axe , various lamps , balls , perfumes , pipes , a pig , a sausage , a parrot , tables , cups , spoons , items of clothing , statues , masks , books , and pets because gifts of value would mark social status contrary to the spirit of the season , these were often the pottery or wax figurines called sigillaria made specially for the day , candles , or '' gag gifts '' , of which augustus was particularly fond since this figure does not appear in accounts from the roman republic , the princeps of the saturnalia may have developed as a satiric response to the new era of rule by a princeps , the title assumed by the first emperor augustus to avoid the hated connotations of the word '' king '' ( rex ) the puritans banned the '' lord of misrule '' in england and the custom was largely forgotten shortly thereafter , though the bean in the pudding survived as a tradition of a small gift to the one finding a single almond hidden in the traditional christmas porridge in scandinavia macrobius , saturnalia 1.10.24 , seems to indicate that the sigillaria was a market that occurred at the end of saturnalia , but the gallo-roman scholar-poet ausonius ( eclogues 16.32 ) refers to it as a religious occasion ( sacra sigillorum , '' rites of the sigillaria '' ) as an observance of state religion , saturnalia was supposed to have been held ante diem xvi kalendas ianuarias , sixteen days before the kalends of january , on the oldest roman calendar , which the romans believed to have been established by the legendary founder romulus and his successor numa pompilius in roman mythology , saturn was an agricultural deity who was said to have reigned over the world in the golden age , when humans enjoyed the spontaneous bounty of the earth without labour in a state of innocence art and literature under augustus celebrated his reign as a new golden age , but the saturnalia makes a mockery of a world in which law is determined by one man and the traditional social and political networks are reduced to the power of the emperor over his subjects on the calendar of philocalus , the saturnalia is represented by a man wearing a fur-trimmed coat next to a table with dice , and a caption reading : '' now you have license , slave , to game with your master the greek equivalent was the kronia , which was celebrated on the twelfth day of the month of hekatombaion , which occurred from around mid-july to mid-august on the attic calendar seneca looked forward to the holiday , if somewhat tentatively , in a letter to a friend : '' it is now the month of december , when the greatest part of the city is in a bustle the greek writer athenaeus also cites numerous other examples of similar festivals celebrated throughout the greco-roman world , including the crete festival of hermaia in honor of hermes , an unnamed festival from troezen in honor of poseidon , the thessaly festival of peloria in honor of zeus pelorios , and an unnamed festival from babylon the participation of freeborn roman women is implied by sources that name gifts for women , but their presence at banquets may have depended on the custom of their time ; from the late republic onward , women mingled socially with men more freely than they had in earlier times he saw the festival 's theme of liberation and dissolution as representing the '' freeing of souls into immortality '' —an interpretation that mithraists may also have followed , since they included many slaves and freedmen in the saturnalia ( macrobius ) , the proximity of the saturnalia to the winter solstice leads to an exposition of solar monotheism , the belief that the sun ( see sol invictus ) ultimately encompasses all divinities as one he may have also been influenced by the idea that jesus had died on the anniversary of his conception ; because jesus died during passover and , in the third century ad , passover was celebrated on 25 march , he may have assumed that jesus 's birthday must have come nine months later , on 25 december by the late republic , the private festivities of saturnalia had expanded to seven days , macrobius , saturnalia 1.10.3 , citing the atellane composers novius and mummius but during the imperial period contracted variously to three to five days the actual date of jesus 's birth is unknown , but , in the fourth century ad , pope julius i ( 337–352 ) formalized that it should be celebrated on 25 december , around the same time as the saturnalia celebrations his capricious commands , such as '' sing naked !
