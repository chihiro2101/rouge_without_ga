for each of the first four months , november to february , the prostitutes take turns to tell five stories each day , relating to the fetishes of their most interesting clients , and thus totaling 150 stories for each month ( in theory at least ; de sade made a few mistakes , as he was apparently unable to go back and review his work as he went along ) in the final vignette of l'age d'or ( 1930 ) , the surrealist film directed by luis buñuel and written by buñuel and salvador dalí , the intertitle narration tells of an orgy of 120 days of depraved actsa reference to the 120 days of sodomand tells us that the survivors of the orgy are ready to emerge the 120 days of sodom is set in a remote medieval castle , high in the mountains and surrounded by forests , detached from the rest of the world , either at the end of louis xiv 's reign or at the beginning of the régence it is perhaps significant that de sade was interested in the manner in which sexual fetishes are developed , as are his primary characters , who urge the storytellers to remind them , in later stages , as to what the client in that particular anecdote enjoyed doing in their younger years feminist writer simone de beauvoir wrote an essay titled '' must we burn sade ? '' , protesting the destruction of the 120 days of sodom because of the light it sheds on humanity 's darkest side when , in 1955 , french authorities planned on destroying it and three other major works by sade sade incited a riot among the people gathered outside when he shouted to them that the guards were murdering inmates ; as a result , two days later on 4 july 1789 , he was transferred to the asylum at charenton , '' naked as a worm '' and unable to retrieve the novel in progress there are therefore a number of recurring figures , such as a man who , in the early tales , enjoys pricking women 's breasts with pins and , at his reappearance in the tales in the 'murderous passions ' category , delights in killing women by raping them atop a bed of nails four wealthy libertines lock themselves in a castle , the château de silling , along with a number of victims and accomplices ( the description of silling matches de sade 's own castle , the château de lacoste ) since they state that the sensations produced by the organs of hearing are the most erotic , they intend to listen to various tales of depravity from four veteran prostitutes , which will inspire them to engage in similar activities with their victims : the girls : : : augustine , 15 : : fanny , 14 : : zelmire , 15 : : sophie , 14 : : colombe , 13 : : hébé , 12 : : rosette , 13 : : mimi , 12 : the boys : : : zélamir , 13 : : cupidon , 13 : : narcisse , 12 : : zephyr , 12 : : celadon , 14 : : adonis , 15 : : hyacinthe , 14 : : giton , 12 four elderly women , chosen for their ugliness to stand in contrast to the children in this introduction , he contradicts himself , at one point insisting that one should not be horrified by the 600 passions outlined in the story because everybody has their own tastes , but at the same time going out of his way to warn the reader of the horrors that lie ahead , suggesting that the reader should have doubts about continuing during the month , the four libertines begin having anal sex with the sixteen male and female children who , along with the other victims , are treated more brutally as time goes on , with regular beatings and whippings either at the outset , or during the writing of the work , de sade had evidently decided he would not be able to complete it in full and elected to write out the remaining three-quarters in brief and finish it later the murder of one of the girls , 15-year-old augustine , is described in great detail , with the tortures she is subjected to including having her flesh stripped from her limbs , her vagina being mutilated and her intestines being pulled out of her sliced-open belly and burned sade wrote the 120 days of sodom in the space of 37 days in 1785 while he was imprisoned in the bastille after that , the remaining three parts are written as a draft , in note form , with de sade 's notes to himself still present in most translations in early 2021 , the french government announced that it offered tax benefits to corporations aiding it in acquiring the original manuscript for the national library of france by sponsoring a sum of €4.55 million gérard lhéritier , president and founder of aristophil , a company specializing in rare manuscripts , bought the scroll for €7 million , and in 2014 put it on display at his musée des lettres et manuscrits ( museum of letters and manuscripts ) in paris during this month , the libertines brutally kill three of the four daughters they have between them , along with four of the female children and two of the male ones at the end of the novel , de sade draws up a list of the characters with a note of those who were killed and when , and also those who survived in 1975 , pier paolo pasolini turned the book into a film , salò , or the 120 days of sodom ( salò o le 120 giornate di sodoma ) as they do throughout the story-telling sections , the four libertinesblangis , the bishop , curval and durcetindulge in activities similar to those they have heard with their daughters and the kidnapped children : hercule , 26 : antinoüs , 40 : brise-cul ( '' break-arse '' ) : bande-au-ciel ( '' erect-to-the-sky '' ) the victims are : the daughters of the four principal characters , whom they have been sexually abusing for years
