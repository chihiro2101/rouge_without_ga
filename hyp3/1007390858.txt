during the 18th and 19th centuries , pedestrianism ( walking ) was a popular spectator sport just as equestrianism still is in places such as the united kingdom and the united states during the rest of the 19th century , many people tried to repeat this feat , including ada anderson who developed it further and walked a half-mile ( 800 & nbsp ; m ) each quarter-hour over the 1,000 hours however major walking feats are still performed , such as the land 's end to john o ' groats walk in the united kingdom , and the traversal of north america from coast to coast the first person to walk around the world was dave kunst who started his walk travelling east from waseca , minnesota on 20 june 1970 and completed his journey on 5 october 1974 , when he re-entered the town from the west roads often have a designated footpath for pedestrian traffic , called the sidewalk in north american english , the pavement in british english , and the footpath in australian and new zealand english some modern towns ( such as the new suburbs of peterborough in england ) are designed with the network of sidewalks and cycle paths almost entirely separate from the road network the term trail is also used by the authorities in some countries to mean any footpath that is not attached to a road or street under british law , regardless of whether there is a footpath , pedestrians have the right to use most public roads , excluding motorways and some toll tunnels and bridges such as the blackwall tunnel and the dartford crossing the proportion of households without a car is 8 % , but a notable exception is new york city , the only locality in the united states where more than half of all households do not own a car ( the figure is even higher in manhattan , over 75 % ) the use of cars for short journeys is officially discouraged in many parts of the world , and construction or separation of dedicated walking routes in city centres receives a high priority in many large cities in western europe , often in conjunction with public transport enhancements in copenhagen , the world 's longest pedestrian shopping area , str√∏get , has been developed over the last 40 years principally due to the work of danish architect jan gehl , a principle of urban design known as copenhagenisation among the well documented factors are : driver behaviour , ( including speeding , drinking and driving ) ; infrastructure missing facilities ( including sidewalks , crossings and raised medians ) ; and vehicle design which are not forgiving to pedestrians crashed by a vehicle in such a situation , a pedestrian is struck by a car front ; for instance the bumper touch either the leg or knee-joint area ; then , the lower part of the body is accelerated forwards , while the upper part of the body rotates and accelerated to the car ; this will likely cause damage to the pelvis and thorax pedestrian fatalities , in 2016 , are 2.6 per million population in the netherlands , 4.3 in sweden , 4.5 per million population in wales , 5.3 in new zealand , 6.0 in germany ; 7.1 in united kingdom , 7.5 in australia , 8.4 in france , 8.4 in spain , 9.4 in italy , 11.1 in israel , 13 in japan , 13.8 in greece , 18.5 in the united states of america , 22.9 in poland , and 36.3 in romania separation of pedestrians from motor vehicles can be improved with refuge islands , sidewalks , pedestrian overpasses or pedestrian underpasses , countdown pedestrian signals , pedestrian hybrid beacons ( or hawk signals ) in california , the california department of transportation provides new roundabouts while the office of traffic safety is funds pedestrian assessments in cities where many pedestrian crashes occur , based on engineering , education and enforcement strategies in contrast , using a car for short trips tends to contribute both to obesity and via vehicle emissions to climate change : internal combustion engines are more inefficient and highly polluting during their first minutes of operation ( engine cold start )
