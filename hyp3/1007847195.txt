however ibm did make the espresso processor for nintendo , which is a 750 based design with improvements such as multiprocessor support ( the part is a triple core ) , new 45 & nbsp ; nm fabrication process and edram instead of regular l2 cache ; it 's unknown if further changes were made to the design it would be the most powerful and featured version to date with up to 4mb of off die l3 cache , a 400mhz ddr front side bus and the same implementation of altivec used in the powerpc 970 it also featured a number of improvements to the memory subsystem : an enhanced and faster ( 200 & nbsp ; mhz ) 60x bus controller , a wider l2 cache bus , and the ability to lock parts of the l2 cache the rad750 packaging and logic functions has a price tag in excess of us 200,000 : the high price is mainly due to radiation hardening revisions to the powerpc 750 architecture and manufacturing , stringent quality control requirements , and extended testing of each processor chip manufactured it was reported to be finished and ready for production in december 2003 , but said timing was too late for it to get significant orders seeing apple 's ibook line had switched to g4s in october the same year , and thus it quickly fell off the roadmap this is smaller than half the size of the '' gekko '' microprocessor ( 43 & nbsp ; mm 2 ) incorporated in the gamecube at its first release in 1999 , ibm fabricated versions in a 0.20 & nbsp ; Î¼m process with copper interconnects , which increased the frequency up to 500 & nbsp ; mhz and decreased power consumption to 6 & nbsp ; w and the die size to 40 & nbsp ; mm 2 750cxe ( codename anaconda ) , introduced in 2001 , was a minor revision of 750cx which increased its frequency up to 700 and memory bus from 100 & nbsp ; mhz to 133 & nbsp ; mhz it was the last g3 type processor used by apple ( employed on the ibook g3 ) in particular , ibm has no public plans to produce an ordinary 750-based microprocessor in a process smaller than 90 nm , effectively phasing it out as a commodity chip competitive in such markets as networking equipment the powerpc 740 and 750 ( codename arthur ) gwennap 1997 were introduced in late 1997 as an evolutionary replacement for the powerpc 603e as the added graphics-related functions match closely the ones found in the gekko processor it is very likely that the 750cl is a shrink of the same processor for general purpose use the powerpc 740 is completely pin compatible with the older 603 , allowing upgrades to the powerbook 1400 , 2400 , and even a prototype powerbook 500/g3 the powerpc 750 was used in many computers from apple , including the original imac the 750fx ( code-named sahara ) came in 2002 and increased frequency up to 900 & nbsp ; mhz , the bus speed to 166 & nbsp ; mhz and the on-die l2 cache to 512 kib it was expected to clock as high as 1.8 & nbsp ; ghz ( starting at 1.5 & nbsp ; ghz ) and reported to have additional pipeline stages , and advanced power management features
