with the discovery of fire , the earliest form of artificial lighting used to illuminate an area were campfires or torches the use of whale oil declined after abraham gesner , a canadian geologist , first refined kerosene in the 1840s , allowing brighter light to be produced at substantially lower cost gas lighting was economical enough to power street lights in major cities starting in the early 1800s , and was also used in some commercial buildings and in the homes of wealthy people the next major drop in price came about in the 1880s with the introduction of electricity in the form of arc lamp for large space and street lighting , followed by incandescent light bulb-based utilities for indoor and outdoor lighting an important property of light fixtures is the luminous efficacy or wall-plug efficiency , meaning the amount of usable light emanating from the fixture per used energy , usually measured in lumen per watt a fixture using replaceable light sources can also have its efficiency quoted as the percentage of light passed from the '' bulb '' to the surroundings the color temperature of a white light source is the temperature in kelvins of a theoretical black body emitter that most closely matches the spectral characteristics of the lamp lower color temperature lamps have relatively more energy in the yellow and red part of the visible spectrum , while high color temperatures correspond to lamps with more of a blue-white appearance for critical inspection or color matching tasks , or for retail displays of food and clothing , the color temperature of the lamps will be selected for the best overall lighting effect lighting is classified by intended use as general , accent , or task lighting , depending largely on the distribution of the light produced by the fixture task lighting is mainly functional and is usually the most concentrated , for purposes such as reading or inspection of materials accent lighting is mainly decorative , intended to highlight pictures , plants , or other elements of interior design or landscaping general lighting ( sometimes referred to as ambient light ) fills in between the two and is intended for general illumination of an area outdoors , general lighting for a parking lot may be as low as 10-20 lux ( 1-2 footcandles ) since pedestrians and motorists already used to the dark will need little light for crossing the area this is often done with fluorescent lighting ( first available at the 1939 world 's fair ) or rope light , occasionally with neon lighting , and recently with led strip light soffit or close to wall lighting can be general or a decorative wall-wash , sometimes used to bring out texture ( like stucco or plaster ) on a wall , though this may also show its defects as well recessed lighting ( often called '' pot lights '' in canada , '' can lights '' or 'high hats '' in the us ) is popular , with fixtures mounted into the ceiling structure so as to appear flush with it track lighting , invented by lightolier , was popular at one period of time because it was much easier to install than recessed lighting , and individual fixtures are decorative and can be easily aimed at a wall further interior light fixtures include chandeliers , pendant lights , ceiling fans with lights , close-to-ceiling or flush lights , and various types of lamps the portable or table lamp is probably the most common fixture , found in many homes and offices the standard lamp and shade that sits on a table is general lighting , while the desk lamp is considered task lighting in a movie theater , steps in the aisles are usually marked with a row of small lights for convenience and safety , when the film has started and the other lights are off while lamps have traditionally been rated and marketed primarily in terms of their power consumption , expressed in watts , proliferation of lighting technology beyond the incandescent light bulb has eliminated the correspondence of wattage to the amount of light produced roger fouquet , heat , power and light : revolutions in energy services , edward elgar publishing , 2008 , page 411 rating and marketing emphasis is shifting away from wattage and towards lumen output , to give the purchaser a directly applicable basis upon which to select a lamp lamp types include : ballast : a ballast is an auxiliary piece of equipment designed to start and properly control the flow of power to discharge light sources such as fluorescent and metal-halide lamp ( hid ) lamps lighting of structures considers aesthetic elements as well as practical considerations of quantity of light required , occupants of the structure , energy efficiency , and cost more critical or complex designs now routinely use computer software such as radiance for mathematical modeling , which can allow an architect to quickly evaluate the benefit of a proposed design in some instances , the materials used on walls and furniture play a key role in the lighting effect lighting illuminates the performers and artists in a live theatre , dance , or musical performance , and is selected and arranged to create dramatic effects dimmers , colored filters , reflectors , lenses , motorized or manually aimed lamps , and different kinds of flood and spot lights are among the tools used by a stage lighting designer to produce the desired effects a set of lighting cues are prepared so that the lighting operator can control the lights in step with the performance ; complex theatre lighting systems use computer control of lighting instruments measurement of light or photometry is generally concerned with the amount of useful light falling on a surface and the amount of light emerging from a lamp or other source , along with the colors that can be rendered by this light the amount of useful light emitted from a source or the luminous flux is measured in lumen ( lm ) it is used in photometry as a measure of the intensity , as perceived by the human eye , of light that hits or passes through a surface the unified glare rating ( ugr ) , the visual comfort probability , and the daylight glare index are some of the most well-known methods of measurement in addition to these new methods , four main factors influence the degree of discomfort glare ; the luminance of the glare source , the solid angle of the glare source , the background luminance , and the position of the glare source in the field of view must all be taken into account to define light source color properties , the lighting industry predominantly relies on two metrics , correlated color temperature ( cct ) , commonly used as an indication of the apparent '' warmth '' or '' coolness '' of the light emitted by a source , and color rendering index ( cri ) , an indication of the light source 's ability to make objects appear natural however , these two metrics , developed in the last century , are facing increased challenges and criticisms as new types of light sources , particularly light emitting diodes ( leds ) , become more prevalent in the market gai represents the relative separation of object colors illuminated by a light source ; the greater the gai , the greater the apparent saturation or vividness of the object colors this is the first device created to accurately measure and characterize light ( intensity , spectrum , timing , and duration ) entering the eye that affects the human body 's clock several strategies are available to minimize energy requirements for lighting a building : specification of illumination requirements for each given use area analysis of lighting quality to ensure that adverse components of lighting ( for example , glare or incorrect color spectrum ) are not biasing the design integration of space planning and interior architecture ( including choice of interior surfaces and room geometries ) to lighting design design of time of day use that does not expend unnecessary energy selection of fixtures and lamps that reflect best available technology for energy conservation training of building occupants to use lighting equipment in most efficient manner maintenance of lighting systems to minimize energy wastage use of natural light some big box stores were being built from 2006 on with numerous plastic bubble skylights , in many cases completely obviating the need for interior artificial lighting for many hours of the day in countries where indoor lighting of simple dwellings is a significant cost , '' moser lamps '' , plastic water-filled transparent drink bottles fitted through the roof , provide the equivalent of a 40- to 60-watt incandescent bulb each during daylight many times , rapid and frequent switching of the lights on and off can occur , particularly during unstable weather conditions or when daylight levels are changing around the switching illuminance daylighting has also been proven to have positive effects on patients in hospitals as well as work and school performance beyond the energy factors being considered , it is important not to over-design illumination , lest adverse health effects such as headache frequency , stress , and increased blood pressure be induced by the higher lighting levels analysis of lighting quality particularly emphasizes use of natural lighting , but also considers spectral content if artificial light is to be used new studies have shown that the performance of students is influenced by the time and duration of daylight in their regular schedules light in school buildings to incorporate the right types of light at the right time of day for the right duration may improve student performance and well-being in addition to increased work performance , proper usage of windows and daylighting crosses the boundaries between pure aesthetics and overall health the researchers asked participants to rate a number of things such as : the spiciness of chicken-wing sauce , the aggressiveness of a fictional character , how attractive someone was , their feelings about specific words , and the taste of two juices–all under different lighting conditions compact fluorescent lamps ( cfls ) use less power than an incandescent lamp to supply the same amount of light , however they contain mercury which is a disposal hazard conflated data , aggregated in the early 2000s , about the increased use of blue-white leds seemed to indicate that their use , while saving energy , may compromise human health for instance , one study conducted by the american medical association warned on the use of high blue content white leds in street lighting , due to their higher impact on human health and environment , compared to low blue content light sources ( e.g light pollution is a growing problem in reaction to excess light being given off by numerous signs , houses , and buildings the world health organization in 2007 issued a report that noted the effects of bright light on flora and fauna , sea turtle hatchlings , frogs during mating season and the migratory patterns of birds the illuminating engineering society ( ies ) , in conjunction with organizations like ansi and ashrae , publishes guidelines , standards , and handbooks that allow categorization of the illumination needs of different built environments the international association of lighting designers ( iald ) is an
