neuroscientists have stated that important functions performed by the mind , such as learning , memory , and consciousness , are due to purely physical and electrochemical processes in the brain and are governed by applicable laws since the function of the human mind and how it might arise from the working of the brain 's neural network , are poorly understood issues , mind uploading relies on the idea of neural network emulator rather than having to understand the high-level psychological processes and large-scale structures of the brain , and model them using classical artificial intelligence methods and cognitive psychology models , the low-level structure of the underlying neural network is captured , mapped and emulated with a computer system on the other hand , a molecule-scale simulation of the brain is not expected to be required , provided that the functioning of the neurons is not affected by quantum mechanical processes however , if short-term memory and working memory include prolonged or repeated firing of neurons , as well as intra-neural dynamic processes , the electrical and chemical signal state of the synapses and neurons may be hard to extract a full brain map has been estimated to occupy less than 2 x 10 16 bytes ( 20,000 tb ) and would store the addresses of the connected neurons , the synapse type and the synapse '' weight '' for each of the brains ' 10 15 synapses a possible method for mind uploading is serial sectioning , in which the brain tissue and perhaps other parts of the nervous system are frozen and then scanned and analyzed layer by layer , which for frozen samples at nano-scale requires a cryo-ultramicrotome , thus capturing the structure of the neurons and their interconnections however , as the function of brain tissue is partially determined by molecular events ( particularly at synapses , but also at other places on the neuron 's cell membrane ) , this may not suffice for capturing and simulating neuron functions however , as the physiological genesis of 'mind ' is not currently known , this method may not be able to access all of the necessary biochemical information to recreate a human brain with sufficient fidelity it may be possible to create functional 3d maps of the brain activity , using advanced neuroimaging technology , such as functional mri ( fmri , for mapping change in blood flow ) , magnetoencephalography ( meg , for mapping of electrical currents ) , or combinations of multiple methods , to build a detailed three-dimensional model of the brain using non-invasive and non-destructive methods underlying the concept of '' mind uploading '' ( more accurately '' mind transferring '' ) is the broad philosophy that consciousness lies within the brain 's information processing and is in essence an emergent feature that arises from large neural network high-level patterns of organization , and that the same patterns of organization can be realized in other processing devices mind uploading also relies on the idea that the human mind ( the '' self '' and the long-term memory ) , just like non-human minds , is represented by the current neural network paths and the weights of the brain synapses rather than by a dualistic and mystic soul and spirit the mind or '' soul '' can be defined as the information state of the brain , and is immaterial only in the same sense as the information content of a data file or the state of a computer software currently residing in the work-space memory of the computer data specifying the information state of the neural network can be captured and copied as a '' computer file '' from the brain and re-implemented into a different physical form an analogy to the idea of mind uploading is to copy the temporary information state ( the variable values ) of a computer program from the computer memory to another computer and continue its execution whether when my brain has lost its original structure , and when some hundred years after the same materials are fabricated so curiously as to become an intelligent being , whether , i say that being will be me ; or , if , two or three such beings should be formed out of my brain ; whether they will all be me , and consequently one and the same intelligent being according to her views , '' uploading '' would probably result in the death of the original person 's brain , while only outside observers can maintain the illusion of the original person still being alive for example , buddhist transhumanist james hughes has pointed out that this consideration only goes so far : if one believes the self is an illusion , worries about survival are not reasons to avoid uploading , and keith wiley has presented an argument wherein all resulting minds of an uploading procedure are granted equal primacy in their claim to the original identity , such that survival of the self is determined retroactively from a strictly subjective position some have also asserted that consciousness is a part of an extra-biological system that is yet to be discovered and can not be fully understood under the present constraints of neurobiology another potential consequence of mind uploading is that the decision to '' upload '' may then create a mindless symbol manipulator instead of a conscious mind ( see philosophical zombie ) are we to assume that an upload is conscious if it displays behaviors that are highly indicative of consciousness ? are we to assume that an upload is conscious if it verbally insists that it is conscious ? could there be an absolute upper limit in processing speed above which consciousness can not be sustained ? the mystery of consciousness precludes a definitive answer to this question he then concludes : “ if , as i argue above , a sufficiently detailed computational simulation of the brain is potentially operationally equivalent to an organic brain , it follows that we must consider extending protections against suffering to simulations would they be given the rights of biological humans ? if a person makes an emulated copy of themselves and then dies , does the emulation inherit their property and official positions ? could the emulation ask to '' pull the plug '' when its biological version was terminally ill or in a coma ? would it help to treat emulations as adolescents for a few years so that the biological creator would maintain temporary control ? would criminal emulations receive the death penalty , or would they be given forced data modification as a form of '' rehabilitation '' ? could an upload have marriage and child-care rights ? if simulated minds would come true and if they were assigned rights of their own , it may be difficult to ensure the protection of '' digital human rights '' for example , social science researchers might be tempted to secretly expose simulated minds , or whole isolated societies of simulated minds , to controlled experiments in which many copies of the same minds are exposed ( serially or simultaneously ) to different test conditions emulations could create a number of conditions that might increase risk of war , including inequality , changes of power dynamics , a possible technological arms race to build emulations first , first-mover advantage , strong loyalty and willingness to '' die '' among emulations , and triggers for racist , xenophobic , and religious prejudice limited computing power would mean the first emulations would run slower and so would be easier to adapt to , and there would be more time for the technology to transition through society arguments for slowing down brain-emulation research : greater investment in brain emulation and associated cognitive science might enhance the ability of artificial intelligence ( ai ) researchers to create '' neuromorphic '' ( brain-inspired ) algorithms , such as neural networks , reinforcement learning , and hierarchical perception this was based on the idea that brain emulation would require understanding some brain components , and it would be easier to tinker with these than to reconstruct the entire brain in its original form many transhumanists look forward to the development and deployment of mind uploading technology , with transhumanists such as nick bostrom predicting that it will become possible within the 21st century due to technological trends such as moore 's law cox , is about the eventual ( and , to the authors , almost inevitable ) evolution of computers into sentient beings , but also deals with human mind transfer mind uploading in fiction brain initiative brain transplant brain-reading cyborg cylon ( reimagining ) democratic transhumanism human brain project isolated brain neuralink posthumanization robotoid ship of theseus—thought experiment asking if objects having all parts replaced fundamentally remain the same object simulation hypothesis simulism technologically enabled telepathy turing test the future of work and death
