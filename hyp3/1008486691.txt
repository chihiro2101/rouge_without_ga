these carbon fibers had sufficient strength ( modulus of elasticity and tensile strength ) to be used as a reinforcement for composites having high strength to weight properties and for high temperature resistant applications for synthetic polymers such as pan or rayon , the precursor is first spun into filament yarns , using chemical and mechanical processes to initially align the polymer molecules in a way to enhance the final physical properties of the completed carbon fiber the atomic structure of carbon fiber is similar to that of graphite , consisting of sheets of carbon atoms arranged in a regular hexagonal pattern ( graphene sheets ) , the difference being in the way these sheets interlock carbon heated in the range of 1500–2000 & nbsp ; °c ( carbonization ) exhibits the highest tensile strength ( 5,650mpa , or 820,000psi ) , while carbon fiber heated from 2500 to 3000 & nbsp ; °c ( graphitizing ) exhibits a higher modulus of elasticity ( 531gpa , or 77,000,000psi ) the tow is a bundle of thousands of continuous individual carbon filaments held together and protected by an organic coating , or size , such as polyethylene oxide ( peo ) or polyvinyl alcohol ( pva ) due to its chemical inertness , it can be used relatively safely amongst most fabrics and materials ; however , shorts caused by the material folding back on itself will lead to increased heat production and can lead to a fire carbon fibers from toray , celanese and akzo found their way to aerospace application from secondary to primary parts first in military and later in civil aircraft as in mcdonnell douglas , boeing , airbus , and irkut mc-21 planes passing current through the composite material 3d network of carbon fibers dissipates thermal energy that increases the surface temperature of the asphalt , which is able to melt ice and snow above it within a few years , after successful use in 1968 of a hyfil carbon-fiber fan assembly in the rolls-royce conway jet engines of the vickers vc10 , rolls-royce took advantage of the new material 's properties to break into the american market with its rb-211 aero-engine with carbon-fiber compressor blades carbon fiber is most notably used to reinforce composite materials , particularly the class of materials known as carbon fiber reinforced polymer the oxidized pan is then placed into a furnace having an inert atmosphere of a gas such as argon , and heated to approximately 2000 & nbsp ; °c , which induces graphitization of the material , changing the molecular bond structure depending upon the precursor to make the fiber , carbon fiber may be turbostratic or graphitic , or have a hybrid structure with both graphitic and turbostratic parts present also , during this period , the japanese government heavily supported carbon fiber development at home and several japanese companies such as toray , nippon carbon , toho rayon and mitsubishi started their own development and production in a comparison between steel and carbon fiber materials for automotive industry , carbon fiber may be 10-12x more expensive this process proved to be inefficient , as the resulting fibers contained only about 20 % carbon and had low strength and stiffness properties the fiber also finds use in filtration of high-temperature gases , as an electrode with high surface area and impeccable corrosion resistance , and as an anti-static component carbon fiber filament yarns are used in several processing techniques : the direct uses are for prepregging , filament winding , pultrusion , weaving , braiding , etc at the tip the capillary is either sealed with epoxy and polished to make carbon-fiber disk microelectrode or the fiber is cut to a length of 75–150 μm to make carbon-fiber cylinder electrode jacob lahijani invented balanced ultra-high young 's modulus ( greater than 100 mpsi ) and high tensile strength pitch carbon fiber ( greater than 500 kpsi ) used extensively in automotive and aerospace applications
