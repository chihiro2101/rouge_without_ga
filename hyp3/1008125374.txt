burt was born on 3 march 1883 , the first child of cyril cecil barrow burt ( b he was born in london ( some sources give his place of birth as stratford-upon-avon , probably because his entry in who 's who gave his father 's address as snitterfield , stratford ; in fact the burt family moved to snitterfield when he was ten ) the birth of cyril lodowic burt was recorded in the general register office ( now part of the office for national statistics ) index of births in england and wales for the june quarter of 1883 : -burt , cyril lodowic st the visits the burts made to the galton estate not only allowed the young burt to learn about the work of francis galton , but also allowed burt to meet him on multiple occasions and to be strongly drawn to his ideas ; especially his studies in statistics and individual differences , two defining characters of the london school of psychology whose membership includes both galton and burt he attended king 's ( now known as warwick ) school , in the county town , from 1892 to 1895 , and later won a scholarship to christ 's hospital , then located in london , where he developed his interest in psychology from 1902 , he attended jesus college , oxford , where he studied classics and took an interest in philosophy and psychology , the latter under william mcdougall mcdougall , knowing burt 's interest in galton 's work , taught him the elements of psychometrics , thus helping burt with his first steps in the development and structure of mental tests , an interest that would last the rest of his life burt was one of a group of students who worked with mcdougall , which included william brown , john flügel , and may smith , who all went on to have distinguished careers in psychology in 1907 , mcdougall invited burt to help with a nationwide survey of physical and mental characteristics of the british people , proposed by francis galton , in which he was to work on the standardization of psychological tests in 1908 , burt took up the post of lecturer in psychology and assistant lecturer in physiology at liverpool university , where he was to work under the famed physiologist sir charles sherrington in 1909 burt made use of charles spearman 's model of general intelligence to analyse his data on the performance of schoolchildren in a battery of tests this first research project was to define burt 's life 's work in quantitative intelligence testing , eugenics , and the inheritance of intelligence in 1913 , burt took the part-time position of a school psychology for the london county council ( lcc ) , with the responsibility of picking out the '' feeble-minded '' children , in accordance with the mental deficiency act of 1913 the post also allowed him to work in spearman 's laboratory , and receive research assistants from the national institute of industrial psychology , including winifred raphael in 1924 burt was also appointed part-time professor of educational psychology at the london day training college ( ldtc ) , and carried out much of his child guidance work on the premises in 1931 burt resigned his position at the lcc and the ldtc after he was appointed professor and chair of psychology at university college london , taking over the position from charles spearman , thus ending his almost 20-year career as a school psychological practitioner one of his students , reuben conrad , recalled that he once arrived at the university with a chimpanzee that he had borrowed from london zoo , though conrad could not recall what point burt was trying to make in 1946 he became the first british psychologist to be knighted for his contributions to psychological testing and for making educational opportunities more widely available , according to an account by j burt was a member of the london school of differential psychology , and of the british eugenics society because he had suggested on radio in 1946 the formation of an organization for people with high iq scores , he was made honorary president of mensa in 1960 over the course of his career , burt published numerous articles and books on a host of topics ranging from psychometrics through philosophy of science to parapsychology it is his research in behaviour genetics , most notably in studying the heritability of intelligence ( as measured in iq tests ) using twin study , that has created the most controversy , frequently referred to as '' the burt affair shortly after burt died it became known that all of his notes and records had been burnt , and he was accused of falsifying research data the possibility of fabrication was first brought to the attention of the scientific community when kamin noticed that burt 's correlation coefficients of monozygotic and dizygotic twins ' iq scores were the same to three decimal places , across articles – even when new data were twice added to the sample of twins leslie hearnshaw , a close friend of burt and his official biographer , concluded after examining the criticisms that most of burt 's data from after world war ii were unreliable or fraudulent philippe rushton , themselves involved in controversy for their views on race , see , for example : francisco gil-white , resurrecting racism , chapter 10 douglas wahlsten ( 2001 ) book review of race , evolution and behavior have claimed that the contentious correlations reported by burt are in line with the correlations found in other twin studies rushton ( 1997 ) wrote that five different studies on twins reared apart by independent researchers corroborated cyril burt 's findings and had given almost the same heritability estimate ( average estimate 0.75 vs jensen has also argued that '' no one with any statistical sophistication , and burt had plenty , would report exactly the same correlation , 0.77 , three times in succession if he were trying to fake the data noting that other studies on the heritability of iq have produced results very similar to those of burt 's , hunt argues that burt did not harm science in the narrow sense of misleading scientists with false results , but that in the broader sense science in general and behaviour genetics in particular were profoundly harmed by the burt affair , leading to a general rejection of genetic studies of intelligence and a drying up of funding for such studies burt 's housekeeper from 1950 recalled to gillie that she had questioned burt on why he had written papers in the names of howard and conway ; his response was that they had done the research and should be credited in response to articles by fletcher , claiming that his biography of burt and attacks by others were motivated by ideological or political malice , hernshaw added to gillie 's claims by stating that burt 's detailed records of visitors contained no records of visits by howard or conway in the years they were supposed to have collaborated with him on collecting and testing 32 pairs of separated monozygotic twins , that his papers contained no correspondence with or written material from them , and that no one close to burt had met them he added that testing separated twins was expensive : burt had no research funds to pay research workers and his own finances were too stretched to pay for it himself the second was that burt could not have obtained the results on the declining levels of scholastic attainments in the 1950s and 1960s that he claimed to have in his 1991 book , fletcher questioned gillie 's claim of the lack of independent articles published by howard or conway in scientific journals other than the journal of statistical psychology edited by burt , claiming howard was also said to be mentioned in the membership list of the british psychological society , prof however joynson accepted that burt frequently used assumed names to publish ( in the journal burt edited , the journal of statistical psychology ) papers that burt had written himself : the names he used included those of howard and conway burt 's defenders have claimed that everyone knew that , after his retirement , burt 's data was flawed and that he published articles under pseudonyms , adding that the british psychological society could have stopped this if it had violated accepted ethical norms of the time 1392 however , although it is clear that some individual members of the british psychological society were aware of burt 's questionable conduct , the reason why he was not censured were as likely to be that it would have been in bad taste to call such a great man to public account , a fault of a profession and its members that could tolerate at the time , and apologise later , for burt 's behaviour 481 nicholas mackintosh edited cyril burt : fraud or framed ? , which was presented by the publisher as arguing that '' his defenders have sometimes , but by no means always , been correct , and that his critics have often jumped to hasty conclusions he summed up the evidence against burt , saying that the data burt presented were '' so woefully inadequate and riddled with error '' , that consequently '' no reliance ( could ) be placed on the numbers he present ( ed ) '' , and went on to confirm his agreement with kamin 's original conclusion , that burt had fabricated his data ) , stephanos : studies in psychology present to cyril burt ( pp '' sir cyril burt : scientific fraud '' , in race is a
