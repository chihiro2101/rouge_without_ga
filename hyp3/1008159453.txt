in some types of electrically active cells , including neurons and muscle cells , the voltage fluctuations frequently take the form of a rapid upward spike followed by a rapid fall all cells in animal body tissues are electrically polarized – in other words , they maintain a voltage difference across the cell 's plasma membrane , known as the membrane potential in neurons , the types of ion channels in the membrane usually vary across different parts of the cell , giving the dendrites , axon , and cell body different electrical properties recent studies have shown that the most excitable part of a neuron is the part after the axon hillock ( the point where the axon leaves the cell body ) , which is called the initial segment , but the axon and cell body are also excitable in most cases each excitable patch of membrane has two important levels of membrane potential : the resting potential , which is the value the membrane potential maintains as long as nothing perturbs the cell , and a higher value called the threshold potential when an action potential is triggered , the membrane potential abruptly shoots upward and then equally abruptly shoots back downward , often ending below the resting level , where it remains for some period of time the shape of the action potential is stereotyped ; this means that the rise and fall usually have approximately the same amplitude and time course for all action potentials in a given cell voltage-gated ion channels are capable of producing action potentials because they can give rise to positive feedback loops : the membrane potential controls the state of the ion channels , but the state of the ion channels controls the membrane potential thus , in some situations , a rise in the membrane potential can cause ion channels to open , thereby causing a further rise in the membrane potential these are sometimes known as hodgkin-huxley sodium channels because they were first characterized by alan hodgkin and andrew huxley in their nobel prize-winning studies of the biophysics of the action potential , but can more conveniently be referred to as na v channels however , the likelihood of a channel 's transitioning from the inactivated state directly to the activated state is very low : a channel in the inactivated state is refractory until it has transitioned back to the deactivated state the inward flow of sodium ions increases the concentration of positively charged cations in the cell and causes depolarization , where the potential of the cell is higher than the cell 's resting potential the integration of various dendritic signals at the axon hillock and its thresholding to form a complex train of action potentials is another form of computation , one that has been exploited biologically to form central pattern generators and mimicked in artificial neural networks the initial work , prior to 1955 , was carried out primarily by alan lloyd hodgkin and andrew fielding huxley , who were , along john carew eccles , awarded the 1963 nobel prize in physiology or medicine for their contribution to the description of the ionic basis of nerve conduction these axons are so large in diameter ( roughly 1 & nbsp ; mm , or 100-fold larger than a typical neuron ) that they can be seen with the naked eye , making them easy to extract and manipulate the second problem was addressed with the crucial development of the voltage clamp , which permitted experimenters to study the ionic currents underlying an action potential in isolation , and eliminated a key source of electronic noise , the current i c associated with the capacitance c of the membrane since the current equals c times the rate of change of the transmembrane voltage v m , the solution was to design a circuit that kept v m fixed ( zero rate of change ) regardless of the currents flowing across the membrane snell , fm in action potentials may also be recorded with small metal electrodes placed just next to a neuron , with neurochips containing eosfets , or optically with dyes that are calcium imaging or to voltage the channel is primarily in a high conductance state punctuated by random and relatively brief transitions to a low conductance states while glass micropipette electrodes measure the sum of the currents passing through many ion channels , studying the electrical properties of a single ion channel became possible in the 1970s with the development of the patch clamp by erwin neher and bert sakmann tetrodotoxin from the pufferfish and saxitoxin from the gonyaulax ( the dinoflagellate genus responsible for '' red tides '' ) block action potentials by inhibiting the voltage-sensitive sodium channel ; similarly , dendrotoxin from the mamba snake inhibits the voltage-sensitive potassium channel such inhibitors of ion channels serve an important research purpose , by allowing scientists to '' turn off '' specific channels at will , thus isolating the other channels ' contributions ; they can also be useful in purifying ion channels by affinity chromatography or in assaying their concentration neurotoxins aimed at the ion channels of insects have been effective insecticides ; one example is the synthetic permethrin , which prolongs the activation of the sodium channels involved in action potentials the smaller cells labeled b are granule cells. alt hand drawn figure of two purkinje cells side by side with dendrites projecting upwards that look like tree branches and a few axons projected downwards that connect to a few granule cells at the bottom of the drawing in 1949 , alan hodgkin and bernard katz refined bernstein 's hypothesis by considering that the axonal membrane might have different permeabilities to different ions ; in particular , they demonstrated the crucial role of the sodium permeability for the action potential this line of research culminated in the five 1952 papers of hodgkin , katz and andrew huxley , in which they applied the voltage clamp technique to determine the dependence of the axonal membrane 's permeabilities to sodium and potassium ions on voltage and time , from which they were able to reconstruct the action potential quantitatively hodgkin and huxley correlated the properties of their mathematical model with discrete ion channels that could exist in several different states , including '' open '' , '' closed '' , and '' inactivated '' in the 21st century , researchers are beginning to understand the structural basis for these conductance states and for the selectivity of channels for their species of ion , through the atomic-resolution crystal structures , fluorescence distance measurements and cryo-electron microscopy studies the two conductances on the left , for potassium ( k ) and sodium ( na ) , are shown with arrows to indicate that they can vary with the applied voltage , corresponding to the voltage-gated ion channel the two conductances on the right help determine the resting membrane potential. alt circuit diagram depicting five parallel circuits that are interconnected at the top to the extracellular solution and at the bottom to the intracellular solution although the hodgkin–huxley model may be a simplification with few limitations compared to the realistic nervous membrane as it exists in nature , its complexity has inspired several even-more-simplified models , such as the morris–lecar model and the fitzhugh–nagumo model , both of which have only two coupled odes the properties of the hodgkin–huxley and fitzhugh–nagumo models and their relatives , such as the bonhoeffer–van der pol model , have been well-studied within mathematics , sato , s ;

by joining action-potential models with models of other parts of the nervous system ( such as dendrites and synapses ) , researchers can study neural computation and simple reflexes , such as escape reflexes and others controlled by central pattern generators
