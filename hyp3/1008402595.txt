maxime guillaume , '' propulseur par réaction sur l'air , '' french patent ( filed : 3 may 1921 ; issued : 13 january 1922 ) his engine was to be an axial-flow turbojet , but was never constructed , as it would have required considerable advances over the state of the art in compressors experimental & prototype us air force jet fighters , jenkins & landis , 2008 on 27 august 1939 the heinkel he 178 became the world 's first aircraft to fly under turbojet power , with test pilot erich warsitz at the controls , warsitz , lutz 2009 the first jet pilot – the story of german test pilot erich warsitz , pen and sword books , england , , p the first jet engines were turbojets , with either a centrifugal compressor ( as in the heinkel hes 3 ) , or axial compressors ( as in the junkers jumo 004 ) which gave a smaller diameter , although longer , engine during the design the turbojet was found to be the optimum for cruising at twice the speed of sound despite the advantage of turbofans for lower speeds for concorde less fuel was required to produce a given thrust for a mile at mach 2.0 than a modern high-bypass turbofan such as general electric cf6 at its mach 0.86 optimum speed british engines , however , utilised nimonic alloys which allowed extended use without overhaul , engines such as the rolls-royce welland and rolls-royce derwent , '' world encyclopedia of aero engines – 5th edition '' by bill gunston , sutton publishing , 2006 , p.192 and by 1949 the de havilland goblin , being type tested for 500 hours without maintenance general electric in the united states was in a good position to enter the jet engine business due to its experience with the high-temperature materials used in their turbosuperchargers during world war ii garvin , '' starting something big '' , , p.5 water injection was a common method used to increase thrust , usually during takeoff , in early turbojets that were thrust-limited by their allowable turbine entry temperature on early engines , the turbine temperature limit had to be monitored , and avoided , by the pilot , typically during starting and at maximum thrust settings well-known examples are the concorde and lockheed sr-71 blackbird propulsion systems where the intake and engine contributions to the total compression were 63 % /8 % '' test pilot '' brian trubshaw , sutton publishing 1999 , , appendix viiib at mach 2 and 54 % /17 % fig.26 at mach 3+ intakes have ranged from '' zero-length '' '' trade-offs in jet inlet design '' sobester , journal of aircraft vol.44 , no.3 , may–june 2007 , fig.12 on the pratt & whitney tf33 turbofan installation in the lockheed c-141 starlifter , to the twin , 65 feet-long , intakes on the north american xb-70 valkyrie , each feeding three engines with an intake airflow of about 800 lb/sec this air comes from the compressor , and without it , the turbines would overheat , the lubricating oil would leak from the bearing cavities , the rotor thrust bearings would skid or be overloaded , and ice would form on the nose cone the air from the compressor , called secondary air , is used for turbine cooling , bearing cavity sealing , anti-icing , and ensuring that the rotor axial load on its thrust bearing will not wear it out prematurely supplying bleed air to the aircraft decreases the efficiency of the engine because it has been compressed , but then does not contribute to producing thrust aerodynamic improvements including splitting the compressor into two separately rotating parts , incorporating variable blade angles for entry guide vanes and stators , and bleeding air from the compressor enabled later turbojets to have overall pressure ratios of 15:1 or more in a turbojet , the air and fuel mixture burn in the combustor and pass through to the turbine in a continuous flowing process with no pressure build-up the fuel-air mixture can only burn in slow-moving air , so an area of reverse flow is maintained by the fuel nozzles for the approximately stoichiometric burning in the primary zone less than 25 % of the air is typically used for combustion , as an overall lean mixture is required to keep within the turbine temperature limits in the first stage , the turbine is largely an impulse turbine ( similar to a pelton wheel ) and rotates because of the impact of the hot gas stream the power developed by the turbine drives the compressor and accessories , like fuel , oil , and hydraulic pumps that are driven by the accessory gearbox the net thrust f_n\ ; of a turbojet is given by : f_n ( \dot - v ) the speed of the jet v_j\ ; must exceed the true airspeed of the aircraft v\ ; if there is to be a net forward thrust on the airframe when used in a turbojet application , where the output from the gas turbine is used in a propelling nozzle , raising the turbine temperature increases the jet velocity '' gas turbine theory '' cohen , rogers , saravanamuttoo , , p72-73 , fig 3.11 however , for supersonic aircraft this can be beneficial , and is part of the reason why the concorde employed turbojets turbojet systems are complex systems therefore to secure optimal function of such system , there is a call for the newer models being developed to advance its control systems to implement the newest knowledge from the areas of automation , so increase its safety and effectiveness
