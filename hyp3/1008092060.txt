the british bristol group of cruisers ( 1909 ) were a departure from previous designs ; with turbine propulsion , mixed coal and oil firing and a 2-inch protective armoured belt as well as deck thus , by definition , they were armoured cruisers , despite displacing only 4,800 & nbsp ; tons ; the light armored cruiser had arrived by world war i , british light cruisers often had either two and perhaps eight guns , or a uniform armament of 6-inch guns on a ship of around 5,000 tons , while german light cruisers progressed during the war from to guns due in part to the desire to curtail excess expenditures in light of the increasing cost of keeping up with german naval production and in part because he felt the type to be outdated , fisher authorized few new cruisers and scrapped 70 older ones fisher 's belief that battlecruisers would take the place of light cruisers to protect cargo ship soon proved impractical , as their high construction cost precluded their availability in sufficient numbers to do so , and destroyers were too small for scouting duties unlike the british , who built both long-range cruisers like the town class for commerce protection and short-range '' scout '' cruisers for fleet support , the germans built a single series of light cruisers for both functions compared to the british '' scout '' type the german ships were bigger , slower and less manoeuvrable but , through a successive series of classes , improved consistently in seagoing qualities for about a three-year period after the british weymouth class of the town series , completed with a uniform armament of 6-inch guns , and before the german pillau class , german light cruisers ( such as the and s ) were faster but maintained a lighter 104 & nbsp ; mm main armament compared to their british town-class counterparts earlier german light cruisers were in competition with a series of british scout cruisers which had a higher speed of 25 knots , but smaller 3-inch 12 pounder guns or 4-inch guns the new ships were larger and better armored than other british treaty cruisers , with a belt in the towns and were capable of 32.5 knots , but for the most part tried to stay within past treaty limitations in world war ii light cruisers had guns ranging from the 5 & nbsp ; inch ( 127 & nbsp ; mm ) of the us and 5.25 & nbsp ; inch of the british anti-aircraft cruisers , up to 6.1 & nbsp ; inch , though the most common size by far was 6 & nbsp ; inch of the peruvian navy was the last light cruiser in service , being retired in 2017 , and will become a museum ship in lima after the development of seaborne guided missiles in the 1950s , all remaining cruisers armed solely with guns , regardless of caliber were redesignated as '' gun cruisers '' ( hull classification symbol ca ) , with guided missile cruisers ( which generally carry some gun armament ) gaining the new hull classification symbol cg
