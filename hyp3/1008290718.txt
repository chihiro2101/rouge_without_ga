abrasive saw : a saw that cuts with an abrasive disc or band , rather than a toothed blade although the term '' kerf '' is often used informally , to refer simply to the thickness of the saw blade , or to the width of the set , this can be misleading , because blades with the same thickness and set may create different kerfs the kerf created by a given blade can be changed by adjusting the set of its teeth with a tool called a saw tooth setter it is taken by setting the tip ( or point ) of one tooth at the zero point on a ruler , and then counting the number of points between the zero mark and the one-inch mark , inclusive ( that is , including both the point at the zero mark and any point that lines up precisely with the one-inch mark ) for example , a rip saw has a tooth set that is similar to the angle used on a chisel , so that it rips or tears the material apart web : a narrow saw blade held in a frame , worked either by hand or in a machine , sometimes with teeth on both edges once mankind had learned how to use iron , it became the preferred material for saw blades of all kinds ; some cultures learned how to harden the surface ( '' case hardening '' or '' steeling '' ) , prolonging the blade 's life and sharpness moxon , j : mechanick exercises , p95-99 in the mid 18th century a superior form of completely melted steel ( '' crucible cast '' ) began to be made in sheffield , england , and this rapidly became the preferred material , due to its hardness , ductility , springiness and ability to take a fine polish barley , simon , british saws and saw makers from c1660 , p7 a small saw industry survived in london and birmingham , but by the 1820s the industry was growing rapidly and increasingly concentrated in sheffield , which remained the largest centre of production , with over 50 % of the nation 's saw makers barley , ibid p42 the us industry began to overtake it in the last decades of the century , due to superior mechanisation , better marketing , a large domestic market , and the imposition of high tariffs on imports early european saws were made from a heated sheet of iron or steel , produced by flattening by several men simultaneously hammering on an anvil ( barley ibid p11 ) after cooling , the teeth were punched out one at a time with a die , the size varying with the size of the saw by the mid 18th century rolling the metal was usual , the power for the rolls being supplied first by water , and increasingly by the early 19th century by steam engines the industry gradually mechanized all the processes , including the important grinding the saw plate '' thin to the back '' by a fraction of an inch , which helped the saw to pass through the kerf without binding ( moxon , ibid , p95 ) the use of steel added the need to harden and temper the saw plate , to grind it flat , to smith it by hand hammering and ensure the springiness and resistance to bending deformity , and finally to polish it ( barley ibid pp5–22 ) a '' pit-man '' stood in the pit , a '' top-man '' stood outside the pit , and they worked together to make cuts , guide the saw , and raise it nest of saws : three or four interchangeable blades fitted to a handle with screws or quick-release nuts ; one-man cross cut saw : a coarse-toothed saw of 30-60 inches length for rough or green timber ; a second , turned , handle could be added at the heel or the toe for a second operator ; pad saw : a short narrow blade held in a wooden or metal handle ( the pad ) ; panel saw : a lighter variety of handsaw , usually less than 24 inches long and having finer teeth ; plywood saw : a fine-toothed saw ( to reduce tearing ) , for cutting plywood ; pruning saw : the commonest variety has a 12-28 inch blade , toothed on both edges , one tooth pattern being considerably coarser than the other ; rip saw : for cutting wood along the grain ; rule/combination saw ; a handsaw with a measuring scale along the back and a handle making a 90° square with the scaled edge ; salt saw : a short hand saw with a non-corroding zinc or copper blade , used for cutting a block of salt at a time when it was supplied to large kitchens in that form ; turkish/monkey saw : a small saw with a parallel-sided blade , designed to cut on the pull stroke ; two-man saw : a general term for a large crosscut saw or rip saw for cutting large logs or trees ; veneer saw : a two-edged saw with fine teeth for cutting veneer ; wire saw : a toothed or coarse cable or wire wrapped around the material and pulled back and forth some examples are : bead saw/gent 's saw/jeweller 's saw : a small backsaw with a turned wooden handle ; blitz saw : a small backsaw , for cutting wood or metal , with a hook at the toe for the thumb of the non-dominant hand ; carcase saw : a term used until the 20th century for backsaws with long blades ; dovetail saw : a backsaw with a blade of length , for cutting intricate joints in cabinet making work ; electrician 's saw : a very small backsaw used in the early 20th century on the wooden capping and casing in which electric wiring was run ; flush-cutting saw/offset saw : a backsaw with a flat side and a handle offset toward the opposite side , usually reversible , for cutting flush to a surface such as a floor ; mitre-box saw : a saw with a blade long , held in an adjustable frame ( the mitre box ) for making accurate crosscuts and mitres in a workplace ; sash saw : a backsaw of blade length bow saw , turning saw or buck saw : a saw with a narrow blade held in tension in a frame ; the blade can usually be rotated and may be toothed on both edges ; it may be a rip or a crosscut , and was the preferred form of hand saw for continental european woodworkers until superseded by machines ; coping saw : a saw with a very narrow blade held in a metal frame in which it can usually be rotated , for cutting wood patterns ; felloe saw ; a pit saw with a narrow tapering blade for sawing out the felloes of wooden cart wheels fretsaw : a saw with a very narrow blade which can be rotated , held in a deep metal frame , for cutting intricate wood patterns such as jigsaw puzzles ; girder saw : a large hack saw with a deep frame ; hacksaw/bow saw for iron : a fine-toothed blade held in a frame , for cutting metal , and other hard materials ; pit saw/sash saw/whip saw : large wooden framed saws for converting timber to lumber , with blades of various widths and lengths up to 10 feet ; the timber is supported over a pit or raised on trestles ; other designs are open bladed ; stave saw : a narrow tapering-bladed pit saw for sawing out staves for wooden casks ; surgeon's/surgical saw/bone cutter : for cutting bone during surgical procedures ; some designs are framed , others have an open blade with a characteristic shape of the toe circular saws can be large for use in a mill or hand held up to 24 '' blades and different designs cut almost any kind of material including wood , stone , brick , plastic , etc if it has a direct-drive blade small enough to set on a workbench , it is called a '' workbench '' or '' jobsite '' saw '' a heavier , more precise and powerful version , driven by several belts , with an enclosed base stand , is called a '' cabinet saw '' a newer version , combining the lighter-weight mechanism of a contractor 's saw with the enclosed base stand of a cabinet saw , is called a '' hybrid saw a '' sliding compound miter saw '' has a blade that can be pulled through the work , in an action similar to that of a radial-arm saw , which provides more capacity for cutting wider workpieces abrasive saw : a circular or reciprocating saw-like tool with an abrasive disc rather than a toothed blade , commonly used for cutting very hard materials hole saw : ring-shaped saw to attach to a power drill , used for cutting a circular hole in material reciprocating saw or '' sabre saw '' ( uk and australia ) : a saw with an '' in-and-out '' or '' up-and-down '' action similar to a jigsaw , but larger and more powerful , and using a longer stroke with the blade parallel to the barrel compared to a circular-saw blade , it produces less waste because it is thinner , dissipates heat better because it is longer ( so there is more blade to do the cutting , and is usually run at a slower speed ; crosscut : in woodworking , a cut made at ( or close to ) a right angle to the direction of the wood grain of the workpiece ; dado blade : a special type of circular saw blade used for making wide-grooved cuts in wood so that the edge of another piece of wood will fit into the groove to make a joint an '' adjustable '' dado blade has a movable locking cam mechanism to adjust the degree to which the blade wobbles sideways , allowing continuously variable groove widths from the lower to upper design limits of the dado ; strobe saw blade : a circular saw blade with special rakers/cutters to easily saw through green or uncured wood that tends to jam other kinds of saw blades as diamond is a superhard material , diamond saw blades can be used to cut hard brittle or abrasive materials , for example , stone , concrete , asphalt , bricks , ceramics , glass , semiconductor and gem stone carbide-tipped saw blades are widely used to cut wood , plywood , laminated board , plastic , glass , aluminum and some other metals
