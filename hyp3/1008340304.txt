against this background appeared the swedish botanist erik acharius disciple of linnaeus , who is today considered the father of lichenology , starting the taxonomy of lichens with his pioneering

lichenologist konstantin mereschkowski presented a research paper '' the theory of two plasms as the basis of symbiogenesis , a new study on the origin of organisms '' , which aims to explain a new theory of symbiogenesis by lichens and other organisms as evidenced by his earlier work '' nature and origin of chromatophores in the plant kingdom '' gleen ( may 1998 ) '' monitoring with

important works on the subject , which marked the beginning of lichenology as a discipline , are : lichenographiae suecia prodromus ( 1798 ) methodus lichenum ( 1803 ) lichenographia universalis ( 1810 ) synopsis methodica lichenum ( 1814 ) later lichenologists include the american scientists vernon ahmadjian and edward tuckerman and the russian evolutionary biologist konstantin merezhkovsky , as well as amateurs such as louisa collings miguel mateo garcia , the growth curve of rhizocarpon geographicum in the valley of madriu andorra , biophysical processes in cold media lichenometry relies upon the fact that the maximum diameter of the largest thallus of an epilithic lichen growing on a substrate is directly proportional to the time from first exposure of the area to the environment as seen in studies by roland beschel in 1950 and is especially useful in areas exposed for less than 1000 years mitchell ( nov 1972 ) diccionario de liquenologia/dictionary of lichenology , kenneth allen

organs , as in other plants , independent of whether asexual reproduction also occurred lichenology has found applications beyond biology itself in the field of geology in a technique known as lichenometry where the age of an exposed surface can be found by studying the age of lichens growing on them the taxonomy of lichens was first intensively investigated by the sweden botanist erik acharius ( 1757–1819 ) , who is therefore sometimes named the '' father of lichenology '' henssen ( 1990 ) studies in lichenology with emphasis on chemotaxonomy , geography and phytochemistry :

their environment despite the above studies the dual nature of lichens remained no more than a theory until in 1939 the swiss researcher eugen a thomas species : eugen a in the french publication annales des sciences naturelles in an article of 1852 '' memorie pour servir a l'histoire des lichens organographique et physiologique '' by edmond tulasne , the reproductive organs or apothecia of lichens was identified at first the presence of algae was taken as being due to contamination due to collection of samples in damp conditions and they were not considered as being in a symbiotic relation with the fungal part of the thallus
