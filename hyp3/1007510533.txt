as with xanthophores and erythrophores , in fish the distinction between iridophores and leucophores is not always obvious , but , in general , iridophores are considered to generate iridescent or metallic colours , whereas leucophores produce reflective white hues it has been demonstrated that the process can be under hormone or neuronal control or both and for many species of bony fishes it is known that chromatophores can respond directly to environmental stimuli like visible light , uv-radiation , temperature , ph , chemicals , etc during vertebrate embryonic development , chromatophores are one of a number of cell types generated in the neural crest , a paired strip of cells arising at the margins of the neural tube it has been demonstrated that the background adaptation process is vision-dependent ( it appears the animal needs to be able to see the environment to adapt to it ) , and that melanin translocation in melanophores is the major factor in colour change this differs from the mechanism used in fish , amphibians , and reptiles in that the shape of the sacculus is changed , rather than translocating pigment vesicles within the cell the primary hormones involved in regulating translocation appear to be the melanocortins , melatonin , and melanin-concentrating hormone ( mch ) , that are produced mainly in the pituitary , pineal gland , and hypothalamus , respectively when the pigment is aggregated toward the centre of the cell , the pigments in other chromatophores are exposed to light and the skin takes on their hue these cells have the ability to migrate long distances , allowing chromatophores to populate many organs of the body , including the skin , eye , ear , and brain in contrast , the word chromatocyte meaning '' cell '' ) was adopted for the cells responsible for colour found in birds and mammals this process , known as physiological colour change , is most widely studied in melanophores , since melanin is the darkest and most visible pigment however , vesicles containing pteridine and carotenoids are sometimes found in the same cell , in which case the overall colour depends on the ratio of red and yellow pigments this type of camouflage , known as background adaptation , most commonly appears as a slight darkening or lightening of skin tone to approximately mimic the hue of the immediate environment other scientists have developed techniques for using melanophores as biosensors , and for rapid disease detection ( based on the discovery that pertussis toxin blocks pigment aggregation in fish melanophores ) coleoid cephalopods ( including octopuses , squids and cuttlefish ) have complex multicellular organs that they use to change colour rapidly , producing a wide variety of bright colours and patterns for this reason , and because the large number and contrasting colour of the cells usually make them very easy to visualise , melanophores are by far the most widely studied chromatophore as the other biochromatic chromatophores are also capable of pigment translocation , animals with multiple chromatophore types can generate a spectacular array of skin colours by making good use of the divisional effect humans have only one class of pigment cell , the mammalian equivalent of melanophores , to generate skin , hair , and eye colour although they appear unusual in their limited taxonomic range , there may be cyanophores ( as well as further unusual chromatophore types ) in other fish and amphibians they have adapted the capability to change colour in response to temperature , mood , stress levels , and social cues , rather than to simply mimic their environment it is found primarily in red blood cells ( erythrocytes ) , which are generated in bone marrow throughout the life of an organism , rather than being formed during embryological development numerous melanocortin , mch and melatonin receptors have been identified in fish and frogs , including a homologue of mc1r , a melanocortin receptor known to regulate skin and hair colour in humans most fish , reptiles and amphibians undergo a limited physiological colour change in response to a change in environment a related type of chromatophore , the leucophore , is found in some fish , in particular in the tapetum lucidum leaving the neural crest in waves , chromatophores take either a dorsolateral route through the dermis , entering the ectoderm through small holes in the basal lamina , or a ventromedial route between the somites and the neural tube
