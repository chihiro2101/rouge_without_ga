in the post-war years ( after 1945 ) , don camillo tarocci ( his full name , which he rarely uses ) is the hotheaded priest of a small town in the po valley in northern italy for the films , the town chosen to represent that of the books was brescello ( which currently has a museum dedicated to don camillo and peppone ) after the production of movies based on guareschi 's tales , but in the first story don camillo is introduced as the parish priest of ponteratto don camillo is constantly at odds with the communist mayor , giuseppe bottazzi , better known as peppone ( meaning , roughly , big joe ) and is also on very close terms with the crucifix in his town church they also appear to have both been partisan fighters during world war ii ; one episode mentions camillo having braved german patrols in order to reach peppone and his fellow communists in the mountains and administer mass to them under field conditions thus , although he publicly opposes the church as a party duty , peppone takes his gang to the church and baptises his children there , which makes him part of don camillo 's flock ; also , peppone and other communists are seen as sharing in veneration of the virgin mary and local saints the italian christian democratic party , the main force in italian politics at the time , does not have a local political organization ( at least , none is ever mentioned ) ; rather , it is the catholic church which unofficially but very obviously plays that role for example , when the communists organize a local campaign to sign the stockholm peace appeal , it is don camillo who organizes a counter-campaign , and the townspeople take for granted that such a political campaign is part of his work as priest in one episode the local communists are incensed at the announcement that the small italian liberal party has scheduled an election rally in their town , and mobilize in force to break it up — only to discover virtually no local liberals have turned up ; the liberal speaker , a middle-aged professor , speaks to a predominantly communist audience and wins its grudging respect by his courage and determination in another , the arrival of pop culture and motorcycles propels don camillo into fighting '' decadence '' , a struggle in which he finds he has his hands full , especially when the christ mainly smiles benevolently on the young rascals don camillo has his own problems — the second vatican council has brought changes in the church , and a new assistant priest , who comes to be called don chichì , has been foisted upon him to see that don camillo moves with the times they always understand and respect each other when one is in danger , when a flood devastates the town , when death takes a loved one , and in many other situations in which the two '' political enemies '' show their mutual respect for one another and fight side by side for the same ideals ( even if they are each conditioned by their individual public roles in society ) guareschi created a second series of novels about a similar character , don candido , archbishop of trebilie ( or trebiglie , literally '' three marble balls '' or '' three billiard balls '' ) the name of this fictional town is a play on words of trepalle ( literally '' three balls '' ) , a real town ( near livigno ) whose priest was an acquaintance of guareschi 's pilot productions , 2015 ( 'don camillo e il suo gregge , translated by lucinda byatt , theresa federici , frances frenaye , wendell ricketts ) the following five were compiled into a larger book published in 1980 : the world of don camillo , the world of don camillo , giovanni guareschi , pub 1980 victor gollancz ltd ;
