in the 18th and 19th centuries , the metaphor of a '' crucible '' or '' smelting pot '' was used to describe the fusion of different nationalities , ethnicities and cultures it was a metaphor for the idealized process of immigration and colonization by which different nationalities , cultures and '' races '' ( a term that could encompass nationality , ethnicity and racist views of humanity ) were to blend into a new , virtuous community , and it was connected to utopian visions of the emergence of an american '' new man '' while '' melting '' was in common use the exact term '' melting pot '' came into general usage in 1908 , after the premiere of the play the melting pot by israel zangwill in his letters from an american farmer ( 1782 ) crevecoeur writes , in response to his own question , '' what then is the american , this new man ? '' that the american is one who '' leaving behind him all his ancient prejudices and manners , receives new ones from the new mode of life he has embraced , the government he obeys , and the new rank he holds '' in 1845 , ralph waldo emerson , alluding to the development of european civilization out of the medieval dark ages , wrote in his private journal of america as the utopian product of a culturally and racially mixed '' smelting pot '' , but only in 1912 were his remarks first published in his essay the significance of the frontier in american history , he referred to the '' composite nationality '' of the american people , arguing that the frontier had functioned as a '' crucible '' where '' the immigrants were americanized , liberated and fused into a mixed race , english in neither nationality nor characteristics '' the exact term '' melting pot '' came into general usage in the united states after it was used as a metaphor describing a fusion of nationalities , cultures and ethnicities in the 1908 play of the same name , first performed in washington , d.c ah , vera , what is the glory of rome and jerusalem where all nations and races come to worship and look back , compared with the glory of america , where all races and nations come to labour and look forward ! '' zangwill thus combined the metaphor of the '' crucible '' or '' melting pot '' with a celebration of the united states as an ideal republic and a new promised land the prophetic words of his jewish protagonist against the backdrop of the statue of liberty allude to emma lazarus 's famous poem the new colossus ( 1883 ) , which celebrated the statue as a symbol of american democracy and its identity as an immigrant nation in terms of immigrants to the united states , the '' melting pot '' process has been equated with americanization , that is , cultural assimilation and acculturation intermarriage between whites and non-whites , and especially african-americans , was a taboo in the united states for a long time , and was illegal in many us states ( see anti-miscegenation laws ) until 1967 the melting pot theory of ethnic relations , which sees american identity as centered upon the acculturation or assimilation and the intermarriage of white immigrant groups , has been analyzed by the emerging academic field of whiteness studies the melting pot was equated with either the acculturation or the total assimilation of european immigrants , and the debate centered on the differences between these two ways of approaching immigration : '' was the idea to melt down the immigrants and then pour the resulting , formless liquid into the preexisting cultural and social molds modeled on anglo-protestants like henry ford and woodrow wilson , or was the idea instead that everyone , mayflower descendants and sicilians , ashkenazi and slovaks , would act chemically upon each other so that all would be changed , and a new compound would emerge ? '' nativists wanted to severely restrict access to the melting pot the compromises that were reached in a series of immigration laws in the 1920s established the principle that the number of new arrivals should be small , and , apart from family reunification , the inflow of new immigrants should match the ethnic profile of the nation as it existed at that time the mixing of whites and blacks , resulting in multiracial children , for which the term '' miscegenation '' was coined in 1863 , was a taboo , and most whites opposed marriages between whites and blacks as a result , two kinds of '' mixture talk '' developed : by the early 21st century , many white americans celebrated the impact of african-american culture , especially in sports and music , and marriages between white americans and african-americans were becoming much more common israel zangwill saw this coming in the early 20th century : '' however scrupulously and justifiably america avoids intermarriage with the negro , the comic spirit can not fail to note spiritual miscegenation which , while clothing , commercializing , and christianizing the ex-african , has given 'rag-time ' and the sex-dances that go with it , first to white america and then to the whole white world white appropriation , stereotyping and mimicking of black culture played an important role in the construction of an urban popular culture in which european immigrants could express themselves as americans , through such traditions as blackface , minstrel shows and later in jazz and in early hollywood cinema , notably in the jazz singer ( 1927 ) analyzing the '' racial masquerade '' that was involved in creation of a white '' melting pot '' culture through the stereotyping and imitation of black and other non-white cultures in the early 20th century , historian michael rogin has commented : '' repudiating 1920s nativism , these films [ rogin discusses the jazz singer , old san francisco ( 1927 ) , whoopee ! ( 1930 ) , king of jazz ( 1930 ) celebrate the melting pot historian richard slotkin sees bataan and the combat genre that sprang from it as the source of the '' melting pot platoon '' , a cinematic and cultural convention symbolizing in the 1940s '' an american community that did not yet exist '' , and thus presenting an implicit protest against racial segregation however , slotkin points out that ethnic and racial harmony within this platoon is predicated upon racist hatred for the japanese enemy : '' the emotion which enables the platoon to transcend racial prejudice is itself a virulent expression of racial hatred.the final heat which blends the ingredients of the melting pot is rage against an enemy which is fully dehumanized as a race of 'dirty monkeys throughout the history of the modern olympic games , the theme of the united states as a melting pot has been employed to explain american athletic success , becoming an important aspect of national self-image the diversity of american athletes in the olympic games in the early 20th century was an important avenue for the country to redefine a national culture amid-a massive influx of immigrants , as well as american indians ( represented by jim thorpe in 1912 ) and blacks ( represented by jesse owens in 1936 ) mark dyerson , '' 'america 's athletic missionaries ' : political performance , olympic spectacle and the quest for an american national culture , 1896–1912 , '' international journal of the history of sport 2008 25 ( 2 ) : 185–203 ;

and that the country was scarcely populated following its independence , the impact of the immigration to argentina becomes evident in the last national census , based on self-identification , 600,000 argentines ( 2 % of the population ) declared to be amerindians although various genetic tests show that in average , argentines have 20 to 30 % indigenous ancestry , which leads many who are culturally european , to identify as white , even though they are genetically mestizo italian population in argentina arrived mainly from the northern italian regions varying between piedmont , veneto and lombardy , later from campania and calabria ; many argentines have the gentilic of an italian city , place , street or occupation of the immigrant as last name , many of them were not necessarily born italians , but once they did the roles of immigration from italy the name usually changed no official figures were available , since the colombian government dropped any references to race in the census after 1918 , but according to rough estimates in the late 1980s , mestizos ( white and native american mix ) constituted approximately 50 % of the population , whites ( predominantly spanish origin , italian , german , french , etc costa rican people is a very syncretic melting pot , because this country has been constituted in percentage since the 16th century by immigrants from all the european countries—mostly spaniards and italians with a lot of germans , british , swedes , swiss , french and croats—also as black people from africa and jamaica , americans , chinese , lebanese and latin americans who have mestized over time with the large native populations ( criollos , castizos , mulattos , blacks and tri-racial ) creating the national average modern ethnic composition the term afghan was originally used to refer to the pashtuns in the middle ages , and the intention behind the creation of the afghan state was originally to be a pashtunistan , but later this policy changed , leading to the inclusion of non-pashtuns in the state as afghans today in afghanistan , the development of a cultural melting pot is occurring , where different afghanistan ethnic groups are mixing together to build a new afghan ethnicity composed of preceding ethnicities in afghanistan today , ultimately replacing the old pashtun identity which stood for afghan there have been rivalries between pashtuns and uzbeks as well , which is likely very similar to the kyrgyzstan crisis , which pashtuns would likely take place as kyrgyz ( for having a similar nomadic culture ) , rivaling with tajiks and uzbeks ( of sedentary culture ) , despite all being sunni muslims in the early years of the state of israel , the term melting pot ( כור היתוך ) , also known as '' ingathering of the exiles '' ( קיבוץ גלויות ) , was not a description of a process , but an official governmental doctrine of assimilating the jewish immigrants that originally came from varying cultures ( see jewish ethnic divisions ) activists such as the iraq-born ella shohat that an elite which developed in the early 20th century , out of the earlier-arrived zionist pioneers of the second and third aliyah ( immigration waves ) —and who gained a dominant position in the yishuv ( pre-state community ) since the 1930s—had formulated a new hebrew culture , based on the values of socialist zionism , and imposed it on all later arrivals , at the cost of suppressing and erasing these later immigrants ' original culture critics respond , however , that a cultural change effected by a struggle within the ashkenazi-east european community , with younger people voluntarily discarding their ancestral culture and formulating a new one , is not parallel to the subsequent exporting and imposing of this new culture on others , who had no part in formulating it in vietnam , a relevant phenomenon is '' tam giáo đồng nguyên '' , meaning the co-existence and co-influence of three major religious teaching schools ( confucianism , buddhism and taoism ) , which shows a process defined as '' cultural addivity ''
