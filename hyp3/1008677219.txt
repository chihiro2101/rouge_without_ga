the united states anti-doping agency notes that , as well as the dangers inherent in iv therapy , '' ivs can be used to change blood test results ( such as hematocrit where epo or blood doping is being used ) , mask urine test results ( by dilution ) or by administering prohibited substances in a way that will more quickly be cleared from the body in order to beat an anti-doping test '' a peripherally inserted central catheter ( also called a picc line ) is a type of central iv access which consists of a cannula is inserted through a sheath into a peripheral vein and then carefully fed towards the heart , terminating at the superior vena cava or the right atrium the part of the catheter that remains outside the skin is called the connecting hub ; it can be connected to a syringe or an intravenous infusion line , or capped with a or saline lock , a needleless connection filled with a small amount of heparin or saline solution to prevent clotting , between uses of the catheter intermittent infusion may be used when there are concerns about the stability of medicine in solution for long periods of time ( as is common with continuous infusions ) , or to enable the administration of medicines which would be incompatible if administered at the same time in the same iv line , for example vancomycin the presence of a cord is a cause of discomfort and pain associated with iv therapy , and makes it more difficult for an iv line to be placed as a line can not be placed in an area with a cord when medications are administered too rapidly through an iv line , a set of vague symptoms such as redness or rash , fever , and others may occur - this is termed an '' infusion reaction '' and is prevented by decreasing the rate of administration of the medication a central line versus peripheral line , and in which vein the line is placed ) can be affected by the potential for some medications to cause peripheral vasoconstriction , which limits circulation to peripheral veins a central line is an access method in which a catheter empties into a larger , more central vein ( a vein within the torso ) , usually the superior vena cava , inferior vena cava or the right atrium of the heart the incidence of side effects specific to a medication can be affected by the type of access ( peripheral versus central ) , the rate of administration , or the quantity of drug administered if the cannula is not inserted correctly , or the vein is particularly fragile and ruptures , blood may extravasate into the surrounding tissues , this situation is known as a blown vein or '' tissuing '' compared with other route of administration , such as oral medications , the iv route is the fastest way to deliver fluids and medications throughout the body equipment used to place and administer an iv line for infusion consists of a bag , usually hanging above the height of the person , and sterile tubing through which the medicine is administered in a basic '' gravity '' iv , a bag is simply hung above the height of the person and the solution is pulled via gravity through a tube attached to a needle inserted into a vein this story is disputed by some , who claim that the idea of blood transfusions could not have been considered by the medical professionals at the time , or that a complete description of blood circulation was not published for over 100 years later medication administered in this way travels through the veins to the heart , from where it is distributed to the rest of the body through the circulatory system any additional medication to be administered intravenously at the same time as an infusion may be connected to the primary tubing ; this is termed a secondary iv , or iv piggyback infiltration is one of the most common adverse effects of iv therapy and is usually not serious unless the infiltrated fluid is a medication damaging to the surrounding tissue , most commonly a vesicant or chemotherapeutic agent in some countries , non-prescription intravenous glucose is used to improve a person 's energy , but is not a part of routine medical care in countries such as the united states where glucose solutions are prescription drugs if a person is only receiving nutrition intravenously , it is called total parenteral nutrition , whereas if a person is only receiving some of their nutrition intravenously it is called partial parenteral nutrition ( or supplemental parenteral nutrition ) some iv lines may be placed with '' y-sites '' , devices which enable a secondary solution to be administered through the same line ( known as piggybacking ) in some cases , such as with vancomycin , a loading or bolus dose of medicine is given before beginning a dosing regimen to more quickly increase the concentration of medication in the blood infiltration may also occur if the puncture of the vein by the needle becomes the path of least resistance - such as a cannula which has been left inserted causing the vein to scar the most common sizes are 16-gauge ( midsize line used for blood donation and transfusion ) , 18- and 20-gauge ( all-purpose line for infusions and blood draws ) , and 22-gauge ( all-purpose pediatric line ) whether a medication can be potentially switched to an oral form is sometimes considered when choosing appropriate antibiotic therapy for use in a hospital setting , as a person is unlikely to be discharged if they are still requiring iv therapy intravenous ( iv ) access is used to administer medications and fluid replacement which must be distributed throughout the body , especially when rapid distribution is desired a tunneled line is a type of central access which is inserted under the skin , and then travels a significant distance through surrounding tissue before reaching and penetrating the central vein using a tunneled line reduces the risk of infection as compared to other forms of access , as bacteria from the skin surface are not able to travel directly into the vein a tourniquet may be used to restrict the venous drainage of the limb and makes the vein bulge , making it easier to locate and place a line in a vein the utility of medical imaging relies on being able to clearly distinguish internal parts of the body from each other - one way this is accomplished is through the administration of a contrast agent into a vein a syringe can be connected directly to this needle , which allows for a '' bolus '' dose to be administered there are several types of central iv access , categorized based on the route the catheter takes from the outside of the body to the central vein output a bolus may be administered rapidly ( with a fast depression of the syringe plunger ) or may be administered slowly , over the course of a few minutes phlebitis is particularly common in intravenous drug users , and those undergoing chemotherapy , whose veins can become sclerotic and difficult to access over time , sometimes forming a hard , painful “ venous cord ” an ekg can also be used in some cases to determine if the end of the cannula is in the correct location infusions can also be intermittent , in which case the medication is administered over a period of time , then stopped , and this is later repeated a peripheral iv line can not be left in the vein indefinitely out of concern for the risk of infection and phlebitis , among other potential complications if a bolus or secondary infusion is intended for administration in the same line as a primary infusion , the molecular compatibility of the solutions must be considered
