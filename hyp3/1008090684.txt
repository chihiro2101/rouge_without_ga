enhanced intensity range is achieved via technological means through the use of an image intensifier , gain multiplication ccd , or other very low-noise and high-sensitivity arrays of photodetectors many animals have a tissue layer called the tapetum lucidum in the back of the eye that reflects light back through the retina , increasing the amount of light available for it to capture , but reducing the sharpness of the focus of the image many animals have better night vision than humans do , the result of one or more differences in the morphology and anatomy of their eyes the image is said to become '' intensified '' because the output visible light is brighter than the incoming light , and this effect directly relates to the difference in passive and active night vision goggles the image intensifier is a vacuum-tube based device ( photomultiplier tube ) that can generate an image from a very small number of photons ( such as the light from stars in the sky ) so that a dimly lit scene can be viewed in real-time by the naked eye via visual output , or stored as data for later analysis in bright light conditions , most of the retinal is not in the photoreceptors , but is outside of the eye these include having a larger eyeball , a larger lens , a larger optical aperture ( the pupils may expand to the physical limit of the eyelids ) , more rods than cones ( or rods exclusively ) in the retina , and a tapetum lucidum right rhodopsin in the human rods is insensitive to the longer red wavelengths , so traditionally many people use red light to help preserve night vision they produce an image in the darkest of nights and can see through light fog , rain , and smoke ( to a certain extent ) thumb a night vision device ( nvd ) is a device comprising an image intensifier tube in a rigid casing , commonly used by military forces all photoreceptor cells in the vertebrate eye contain molecules of photoreceptor protein which is a combination of the protein photopsin in cone cell , rhodopsin in rod cell , and retinal ( a small photoreceptor molecule ) this causes the image screen to illuminate with a picture in the same pattern as the light that strikes the photocathode and on a wavelength the human eye can see rather than being scattered , the light is passed to each nucleus individually , by a strong lensing effect due to the nuclear inversion , passing out of the stack of nuclei , and into the stack of ten photorecepting rod cell the retinal must diffuse from the vision cell , out of the eye , and circulate via the blood to the liver where it is regenerated before the introduction of image intensifiers , night glasses were the only method of night vision , and thus were widely utilized , especially at sea gated imaging technology can be divided into single shot , where the detector captures the image from a single light pulse , and multi-shot , where the detector integrates the light pulses from multiple shots to form an image a specific type of nvd , the night vision goggle ( nvg ) is a night vision device with dual eyepieces an automotive night vision system is used to improve a vehicle driver 's perception and seeing distance in darkness or poor weather
