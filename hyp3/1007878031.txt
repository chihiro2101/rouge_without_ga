chitin is a modified polysaccharide that contains nitrogen ; it is synthesized from units of n-acetylglucosamine ( to be precise , 2- ( acetylamino ) -2-deoxy- d -glucose ) these units form covalent β- ( 1→4 ) -linkages ( like the linkages between glucose units forming cellulose ) in most arthropods , however , it is often modified , occurring largely as a component of composite materials , such as in sclerotin , a tanned proteinaceous matrix , which forms much of the exoskeleton of insects p.69 another difference between pure and composite forms can be seen by comparing the flexible body wall of a caterpillar ( mainly chitin ) to the stiff , light elytron of a beetle ( containing a large proportion of sclerotin ) in butterfly wing scales , chitin is organized into stacks of gyroids constructed of chitin photonic crystals that produce various iridescent colors serving phenotype signaling and communication for mating and foraging according to in vitro studies , chitin is sensed by receptors , such as fibcd1 , klrb1 , reg3g , toll-like receptor 2 , clec7a , and mannose receptors the immune response can sometimes clear the chitin and its associated organism , but sometimes the immune response is pathological and becomes an allergy ; allergy to house dust mites is thought to be driven by a response to chitin examples of the potential uses of chemically modified chitin in food processing include the formation of edible films and as an additive to thicken and stabilize foods and food emulsions how chitin interacts with the immune system of plants and animals has been an active area of research , including the identity of key receptors with which chitin interacts , whether the size of chitin particles is relevant to the kind of immune response triggered , and mechanisms by which immune systems respond chitin and chitosan are under development as scaffolds in studies of how tissue grows and how wounds heal , and in efforts to invent better bandages , surgical suture , and materials for allotransplantation in this scenario , the biopolymers in the chitin act as the binder for the regolith aggregate to form a concrete-like composite material
