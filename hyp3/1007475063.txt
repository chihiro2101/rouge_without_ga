he was a fellow of the royal astronomical society ( 1948 ) , the royal society ( 1964 ) , the american geophysical union ( 1962 ) , the american academy of arts and sciences ( 1974 ) , and the american astronautical society , a member of the american philosophical society ( 1972 ) , the united states national academy of sciences ( 1974 ) and the international academy of astronautics , and an honorary fellow of trinity college , cambridge ( 1986 ) in a 1992 paper , '' the deep , hot biosphere '' published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences , gold first suggested that microbial life is widespread in the porosity of the crust of the earth , down to depths of several kilometers , where rising temperatures finally set a limit gold was born on may 22 , 1920 in vienna , austria to max gold , a wealthy jewish industrialist ( pre-war ) who ran one of austria 's largest mining and metal fabrication companies , and german former actress josefine martin gold resigned from the royal observatory following spencer-jones 's retirement and moved to the united states in 1956 , where he served as professor of astronomy ( 1957–1958 ) and robert wheeler wilson professor of applied astronomy ( 1958–1959 ) at harvard university '' in light of the controversy surrounding the sludge and possible drill contamination , gold abandoned the project at gravberg-1 , calling it a '' complete fiasco '' , and redesigned the experiment by replacing his oil-based drilling lubricant with a water-based one thomas gold , an astrophysicist at cornell university known for bold theorizing , has speculated that subterranean life may dot the cosmos , secluded beneath the surfaces of planets and moons and energized by geological processes , with no need for the warming radiation of nearby stars in 1951 , at a meeting of the royal astronomical society , gold proposed that the source of recent radio signals detected from space was outside the milky way galaxy , much to the derision of radio astronomer martin ryle and several mathematical cosmologists ' '' gold also published a book of the same title , the deep hot biosphere , in 1999 , which expanded on the arguments in his 1992 paper and included speculations on the origin of life and on horizontal gene transfer . in 1985 , gold won the prestigious gold medal of the royal astronomical society , an award whose recipients include fred hoyle , hermann bondi , martin ryle , edwin hubble , james van allen , fritz zwicky , hannes alfvén and albert einstein in 2019 , a study of gases and secondary carbonate minerals revealed that long-term microbial methanogenesis has occurred in situ deep within the fracture system of the crater ( for at least 80 million years ) and with an obvious spatial link to seep oils of surficial sedimentary origin , at odds with gold 's theories of deep abiotic gas migration gold had also contributed to the apollo program by designing the apollo lunar surface closeup camera ( alscc ) ( a kind of stereo camera ) used on the apollo 11 , 12 , and 14 missions . although gold won a prize fellowship from trinity college for his thesis on the regeneration and obtained a junior lectureship at the cavendish laboratory , his theory was widely ignored by ear specialists and physiologists , such as future nobel prize winner georg von békésy , who did not believe the cochlea operated under a feedback system several oil-rich regions , such as alaska , texas , the caribbean , mexico , venezuela , the persian gulf , the urals , siberia , and southeast asia , were found to be lying on major earthquake belts . two papers were published in 1948 discussing the '' steady-state theory '' as an alternative to the big bang : one by gold and bondi , the other by hoyle gold was ridiculed by fellow scientists , not only for his hypothesis , but for the approach he took in communicating nasa 's concerns to the american public ; in particular , some experts were infuriated with his usage of the term '' moon dust '' in reference to lunar regolith gold began testing his theory in 1986 when , with the backing of a group of investors , vattenfall and the gas research institute , he commenced efforts to drill a deep borehole – named gravberg-1 – into the earth near lake siljan in search of abiogenic gas in the mantle anthony tucker of the guardian said , '' throughout his life he would dive into new territory to open up problems unseen by others – in biophysics , astrophysics , space engineering , or geophysics apollo lunar surface closeup camera ( alscc ) image catalog , apollo image atlas , lunar and planetary institute in the 1970s and 1980s , gold was a vocal critic of nasa 's space shuttle program , deriding claims that the agency could fly 50 missions a year or that it could have low budget costs in early 1959 , he accepted an appointment at cornell university , which had offered him the opportunity to set up an interdisciplinary unit for radiophysics and space research , and take charge of the department of astronomy it is my belief , based on fifty years of observation of gold as a friend and colleague , that the deep hot biosphere is all of the above : original , important , controversial — and right his 1987 book power from the earth devoted five pages to describing important russian contributions to the field , including those by mendeleev , sokoloff , vernadsky , kudryavtsev , beskrovny , porfir'ev , kravtsov , kropotkin , valyaev , voronoy , and chekaliuk pumphrey , a zoologist at the cambridge zoology laboratory who had served as the deputy head of radar naval research during the war , to study the effect of resonance on the human ear a 1993 article by journalist william broad , published in the new york times and titled '' strange new microbes hint at a vast subterranean world , '' carried gold 's thesis to public attention gold and bondi also stated that the issues with time scale that had plagued other cosmological theories – such as the discrepancy between the age of the universe as calculated by hubble and dating of radioactive decay in terrestrial rocks – were absent for the steady-state theory . gold disputed philp 's finding , believing that the oil and gas could have just as easily migrated up to the surface : '' they would have it that the oil and gas we found down there was from the five feet of sediments on the top – had seeped all the way down six kilometres down into the granite . in may 1940 , just as hitler was commencing his advance in belgium and france , gold was sent into internment as an enemy alien by the british government in short , gold said about the origin of natural hydrocarbons ( petroleum and natural gas ) : hydrocarbons are not biology reworked by geology ( as the traditional view would hold ) , but rather geology reworked by biology after graduating with a pass ( ordinary ) degree in june 1942 , gold worked briefly as an agricultural labourer and lumberjack in northern england before joining bondi and fred hoyle on naval research into radar ground clutter near dunsfold , surrey in addition , proponents of the theory predicted that in addition to hydrogen atoms , antimatter would also be produced , as with cosmic gamma rays from the annihilation of protons and antiprotons and x-ray emitting gas from the creation of neutrons gold even supported hoyle 's modified steady-state theory , however , by 1998 , he started to express some doubts about the theory , but maintained that despite its faults , the theory helped improve understanding regarding the origin of the universe this led the three to all start questioning the big bang theory originally proposed by georges lemaître in 1931 and later advanced by george gamow , which suggested that the universe expanded from an extremely dense and hot state and continues to expand today from this , gold proposed that the earth may possess a virtually endless supply – suggesting as much as '' at least 500 million years ' worth of gas '' – of fossil fuels however , gold 's theory became widely accepted following the discovery of a pulsar in the crab nebula using the arecibo radio telescope , opening the door for future advancements in solid-state physics and astronomy . one skeptic , christer akerman , the chief geologist of the geological survey of sweden , remarked , '' there is every reason to stay calm and await the analysis of what they have found the three men would spend their off-duty hours in '' intense and wide-ranging scientific discussion '' on topics such as cosmology , mathematics and astrophysics gold spent most of his nearly 15 months of internment in a camp in canada , after which he returned to england and reentered cambridge university , where he abandoned his study of mechanical sciences for physics during his tenure , gold hired famed astronomers carl sagan and frank drake , helped establish the world 's largest radio telescope at the arecibo observatory in puerto rico and the cornell-sydney university astronomy center with harry messel from the 1950s , gold served as a consultant to nasa and held positions on several national space committees , including the president 's science advisory committee , as the united states tried to develop its space program the region was the site of a large meteor crater , which would have '' opened channels deep enough for the methane to migrate upward '' and formed deposits in caprock just a few miles beneath the surface gold and soter suggested that these belts may explain the upward migration of gases through the ground , and subsequently , the production of oil and gas fields
