the coast is warmer ; on the coast antarctic average temperatures are around ( in the warmest parts of antarctica ) and in the elevated inland they average about in vostok the total precipitation on antarctica , averaged over the entire continent , is about per year ( vaughan et al the actual rates vary widely , from high values over the peninsula ( 15 to 25 inches a year ) to very low values ( as little as in the high interior ( bromwich , reviews of geophysics , 1988 ) note that the quoted precipitation is a measure of its equivalence to water , rather than being the actual depth of snow nearly all of antarctica is covered by a sheet of ice that is , on average , a mile thick or more ( 1.6 & nbsp ; km ) the antarctic is so cold that even with increases of a few degrees , temperatures would generally remain below the melting point of ice because ice flows , albeit slowly , the ice within the ice sheet is younger than the age of the sheet itself the majority of ice shelf consists of floating ice , and a lesser amount consists of glaciers that move slowly from the land mass into the sea if ice shelves break up , the ice flow behind them may accelerate , resulting in increasing melt of the antarctic ice sheet and an increasing contribution to sea level 2015 : a study concluded that the remaining larsen b ice-shelf will disintegrate by the end of the decade , based on observations of faster flow and rapid thinning of glaciers in the area the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of antarctica is positive – that is , the temperature is increasing – and significant at more than per decade since 1957 the british antarctic survey , which has undertaken the majority of britain 's scientific research in the area , stated in 2009 : west antarctic ice loss could contribute to sea level rise antarctica predicted to warm by around over this century 10 % increase in sea ice around the antarctic rapid ice loss in parts of the antarctic warming of the southern ocean will cause changes in antarctic ecosystem hole in ozone layer , which has delayed the impact of greenhouse gas increases on antarctica 's climate the area of strongest cooling appears at the south pole , and the region of strongest warming lies along the antarctic peninsula a possible explanation is that loss of uv-absorbing ozone may have cooled the stratosphere and strengthened the polar vortex , a pattern of spinning winds around the south pole the spot , which is located in the heart of the west antarctic ice sheet , is one of the fastest-warming places on earth temperature data from the reader project a pamphlet about the weather and climate of antarctica antarctica 's central ice cap grows while glaciers melt antarctica climate and weather
