this importance stems from : the large number of skilled workers required directly by the shipyard , along with supporting industries such as steel mills , railroads and engine manufacturers ; and a nation 's need to manufacture and repair its own navy and vessels that support its primary industries historically , the industry has suffered from the absence of global rules and a tendency towards ( state-subsidy ) over-investment due to the fact that shipyards offer a wide range of technologies , employ a significant number of workers , and generate income as the shipbuilding market is global if a shipbuilder entered the occupation due to family tradition , the shipbuilder learned the techniques of shipbuilding from his family and is very likely to earn a higher status in the shipyard these considerations led to the documentation of design and construction practices in what had previously been a secretive trade run by master shipwrights , and ultimately led to the field of naval architecture , where professional designers and draftsmen played an increasingly important role the '' khufu ship '' , a 43.6-meter vessel sealed into a pit in the giza pyramid complex at the foot of the great pyramid of giza in the fourth dynasty around 2500 bc , is a full-size surviving example which may have fulfilled the symbolic function of a solar barque the shipbuilders were brought from different places in china to the shipyard in nanjing , including zhejiang , jiangxi , fujian , and huguang ( now the provinces of hubei and hunan ) as a result , the world shipbuilding market suffers from over-capacities , depressed prices ( although the industry experienced a price increase in the period 2003–2005 due to strong demand for new ships which was in excess of actual cost increases ) , low profit margins , trade distortions and widespread subsidisation because the ships are all buried together and near a mortuary belonging to khasekhemwy , originally they were all thought to have belonged to him , but one of the 14 ships dates to 3000 & nbsp ; bc , and the associated pottery jars buried with the vessels also suggest earlier dating japan used shipbuilding in the 1950s and 1960s to rebuild its industrial structure ; south korea started to make shipbuilding a strategic industry in the 1970s , and china is now in the process of repeating these models with large state-supported investments in this industry however , a large number of repair and maintenance works can only be carried out while the ship is out of commercial operation , in a ship repair yard despite her success , and the great savings in cost and space provided by the iron hull , compared to a copper sheathed counterpart , there remained problems with fouling due to the adherence of weeds and barnacles though still largely based on pre-industrial era materials and designs , ships greatly improved during the early industrial revolution period ( 1760 to 1825 ) , as '' the risk of being wrecked for atlantic shipping fell by one third , and of foundering by two thirds , reflecting improvements in seaworthiness and navigation respectively in the islamic world , shipbuilding thrived at basra and alexandria , the dhow , felucca , baghlah and the sambuk , became symbols of successful maritime trade around the indian ocean ; from the ports of east africa to southeast asia and the ports of sindh and hind ( india ) during the abbasid period after the second world war , shipbuilding ( which encompasses the shipyards , the marine equipment manufacturers , and many related service and knowledge providers ) grew as an important and strategic industry in a number of countries around the world during the war , thousands of liberty ships and victory ships were built , many of them in shipyards that did n't exist before the war shipyard construction records shipyards united states—from globalsecurity.org shipbuilding news bataviawerf – the historic dutch east indiaman ship yard—shipyard of the historic ships batavia and zeven provincien in the netherlands , since 1985 here have been great ships reconstructed using old construction methods he wrote and illustrated a book that contains a treatise on ship building , a treatise on mathematics , much material on astrology , and other materials therefore , due to the highly commercialized society that was being encouraged by the expeditions , trades , and government policies , the shipbuilders needed to acquire the skills to build ships that fulfil these requirements from taiwan , they first settled the island of luzon in the philippines before migrating onwards to the rest of island southeast asia and to micronesia by 1500 bc , covering distances of thousands of kilometers of open ocean the most modern shipyards pre-install equipment , pipes , electrical cables , and any other components within the blocks , to minimize the effort needed to assemble or install components deep within the hull once it is welded together the ships of the napoleonic wars were still built more or less to the same basic plan as those of the spanish armada of two centuries earlier but there had been numerous subtle improvements in ship design and construction throughout this period shipbuilders in the ming dynasty ( 1368~1644 ) were not the same as the shipbuilders in other chinese dynasties , due to hundreds of years of accumulated experiences and rapid changes in the ming dynasty the liberty ships : the history of the '' emergency '' type cargo ships constructed in the united states during the second world war , pp in the us , the jones act ( which places restrictions on the ships that can be used for moving domestic cargoes ) has meant that merchant shipbuilding has continued , albeit at a reduced rate , but such protection has failed to penalise shipbuilding inefficiencies for instance , the introduction of tumblehome ; adjustments to the shapes of sails and hulls ; the introduction of the wheel ; the introduction of hardened copper fastenings below the waterline ; the introduction of copper sheathing as a deterrent to shipworm and fouling ; etc sometime around the 12th century , northern european ships began to be built with a straight sternpost , enabling the mounting of a rudder , which was much more durable than a steering oar held over the side the ships of ancient egypt 's eighteenth dynasty were typically about 25 & nbsp ;
