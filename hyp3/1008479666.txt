chicago studies in ethnomusicology , university of chicago press , 1990 one of the earliest forms of the hurdy-gurdy was the organistrum , a large instrument with a guitar-shaped body and a long neck in which the keys were set ( covering one diatonic octave ) the organistrum had a single melody string and two drone strings , which ran over a common bridge , and a relatively small wheel one of the earliest visual depictions of the organistrum is from the twelfth-century pórtico da gloria ( portal of glory ) on the cathedral at santiago de compostela , galicia , spain : it has a carving of two musicians playing an organistrum the solo organistrum was known from spain and france , but was largely replaced by the symphonia , a small box-shaped version of the hurdy-gurdy with three strings and a diatonic keyboard during the renaissance , the hurdy-gurdy was a very popular instrument ( along with the bagpipe ) and the characteristic form had a short neck and a boxy body with a curved tail end by the end of the 17th century changing musical tastes demanded greater polyphonic capabilities than the hurdy-gurdy could offer and pushed the instrument to the lowest social classes ; as a result it acquired names like the german bauernleier 'peasant 's lyre ' and bettlerleier 'beggar 's lyre ' during the 18th century , however , french rococo tastes for rustic diversions brought the hurdy-gurdy back to the attention of the upper classes , where it acquired tremendous popularity among the nobility , with famous composers writing works for the hurdy-gurdy during this time the hurdy-gurdy also spread further to central europe , where further variations developed in western slavic countries , german-speaking areas and hungary ( see the list of types below for more information on them ) although the song does not use a hurdy-gurdy , the repeated reference to the instrument in the song 's lyrics sparked curiosity and interest among young people , eventually resulting in an annual hurdy-gurdy music festival in the olympic peninsula area of the state of washington each september revivals have been underway for many years as well in austria , belarus , belgium , the czech republic , germany , italy , the netherlands , poland , portugal , russia , slovakia , spain , sweden and ukraine as the instrument has been revived , musicians have used it in a variety of styles of music ( see the recordings featuring the hurdy-gurdy ) , including contemporary forms not typically associated with it in the eighteenth century , the term hurdy-gurdy was also applied to a small , portable barrel organ or street organ ( a cranked box instrument with a number of organ pipes , a bellows and a barrel with pins that rotated and programmed the tunes ) that was frequently played by poor busking , street musicians specifically called organ grinders because of the prominence of the french tradition , many instrument and performance terms used in english are commonly taken from the french , and players generally need to know these terms to read relevant literature such common terms include the following : trompette : the highest-pitched drone string that features the buzzing bridge mouche : the drone string pitched a fourth or fifth below the trompette petit bourdon : the drone string pitched an octave below the trompette gros bourdon : the drone string pitched an octave below the mouche chanterelle ( s ) : melody string ( s ) , also called chanters or chanter strings in english chien : ( literally '' dog '' ) , the buzzing bridge tirant : a small peg set in the instrument 's tailpiece that is used to control the sensitivity of the buzzing bridge according to the oxford english dictionary , the mid 18th century origin of the term hurdy-gurdy is onomatopoeia in origin , after the repetitive warble in pitch that characterizes instruments with solid wooden wheels that have warped due to changes in humidity or after the sound of the buzzing-bridge 31 , 1931 ) in france , the instrument is known as vielle à roue ( wheel fiddle ) or simply vielle ( even though there is another instrument with this name ) , while in the french-speaking regions of belgium it is also known in local dialects as vièrlerète/vièrlète or tiesse di dj'va ( 'horse 's head ' ) in italy , it is called the ghironda or lira tedesca while in spain , it is a zanfona in galicia , zanfoña in zamora , rabil in asturias and viola de roda in catalonia leier , lant , and related terms today are generally used to refer to members of the lute or lyre family , but historically had a broader range of meaning and were used for many types of stringed instruments historically , strings were made of gut , which is still a preferred material today and modern instruments are mounted with violin ( d or a ) and cello ( a , g , c ) strings the melody string ( s ) ( french chanterelle ( s ) , hungarian dallamhúr ( ok ) ) are stopped with tangents attached to keys that change the vibration length of the string , much as a guitarist uses his or her fingers on the fretboard of a guitar in the earliest hurdy-gurdies these keys were arranged to provide a pythagorean tuning , but in later instruments the tunings have varied widely , with equal temperament most common because it allows easier blending with other instruments in addition , individual strings ( in particular the melody strings ) often have to have their height above the wheel surface adjusted by having small pieces of paper placed between the strings and the bridge , a process called shimming in some types of hurdy-gurdy , notably the french vielle à roue ( 'fiddle with a wheel ' ) and the hungarian tekerőlant ( tekerő for short ) , makers have added a buzzing bridge—called a chien ( french for dog ) or recsegő ( hungarian for '' buzzer '' ) —on one drone string the tail of the buzzing bridge is inserted into a narrow vertical slot ( or held by a peg in hungarian instruments ) that holds the buzzing bridge in place ( and also serves as a bridge for additional drone strings on some instruments ) the free end of the dog ( called the hammer ) rests on the soundboard of the hurdy-gurdy and is more or less free to vibrate when the wheel is turned regularly and not too fast the pressure on the string ( called the trompette on french instruments ) holds the bridge in place , sounding a drone on french-style instruments , the sensitivity of the buzzing bridge can be altered by turning a peg called a tirant in the tailpiece of the instrument that is connected by a wire or thread to the trompette the percussion is transmitted to the wheel by striking the handle with the thumb , fingers or base of the thumb at one or more of four points in the revolution of the wheel ( often described in terms of the clock face , 12 , 3 , 6 and 9 o'clock ) to achieve the desired rhythm on the hungarian tekerő the same control is achieved by using a wedge called the recsegőék ( control wedge , or literally '' buzzer wedge '' ) that pushes the drone string downward in traditional tekerő playing , the buzzing bridge is controlled entirely by the wrist of the player and has a very different sound and rhythmic possibilities from those available on french instruments small-wheeled ( wheel diameter less than 14 & nbsp ; cm , or about 5.5 & nbsp ; inches ) instruments are traditionally found in central and eastern europe because of the small size of the wheel these instruments most commonly have three strings : one melody string , one tenor drone and one bass drone the type of buzzing bridge found on this instrument usually has the adjustment peg set in a block next to the string , rather than in the tailpiece ( as is typical of french instruments ) contemporary instruments often have more : the instrument of well-known player gilles chabenat has four melody strings fixed to a viola tailpiece , and four drone strings on a cello tailpiece sometimes , two of the melody strings are in unison , and the remaining string is tuned an octave lower , in unison with the bordonciño ( this string was sometimes known as the human voice , because it sounds as if someone is humming the melody an octave lower )
