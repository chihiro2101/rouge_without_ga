when the northern territory branch of the australian medical association publicly opposed the proposed northern territory legislation to provide for legal euthanasia , nitschke and a small group of dissenting territory doctors published a contrary opinion in the nt news under the banner doctors for change after the rights of the terminally ill act ( roti act ) came into force on 1 july 1996 , nitschke assisted four terminally ill people to end their lives using the euthanasia device he developed on 22 may 2002 , crick , in the presence of over 20 friends and family ( but not nitschke ) , took a lethal dose of barbiturates , went quickly to sleep and died within 20 minutes he also made headlines , even angering some fellow right-to-die advocates , when he presented his plan to launch a '' death ship '' that would have allowed him to circumvent local laws by euthanising people from around the world in international waters although nitschke was unaware of the investigation at the time , he now believes that brayley , whom he described as a '' serial killer '' , had made a rational decision to commit suicide rather than face long imprisonment nitschke stated that he does not believe he could have changed brayley 's mind , that brayley was not his patient , that brayley was not depressed and did not seek or want nitschke 's advice the medical board of australia ( mba ) and beyondblue said nitschke had an obligation to refer the man to a psychologist or psychiatrist ( a view dismissed by the nt supreme court in 2015 ) on 23 july 2014 , as a consequence of the brayley case , the mba voted to use emergency powers to suspend his practitioner 's licence immediately , on the grounds that he presented '' a serious risk to public health and safety '' nitschke said he would appeal the suspension , which he claimed was politically motivated , and that the board '' made it clear that what they really object to is the way i think it 's ideas they object to — namely , my belief that people should have a right to suicide , is something they think is contrary to medical practice in late 2014 the appeal was rejected on the grounds that , although it was accepted that brayley was not nitschke 's patient , the controversial concept of rational suicide was inconsistent with the medical profession 's code of conduct and that , as a medical practitioner providing advice on suicide , he posed a serious risk because people may elect to commit suicide believing it to be a pathway sanctioned by a medical practitioner and perhaps the medical profession generally on 6 july 2015 the northern territory supreme court upheld nitschke 's appeal , finding the emergency suspension of his licence by the mba should not have been upheld by a review tribunal justice hiley 's ruling said that the tribunal and board had misconstrued the doctors ’ code of conduct , which requires them to '' protect and promote the health of individuals '' , as extending to all doctors and all individuals '' a doctor would constantly need to fear that any interaction with any other individual or community , including an individual who is not and never has been his or her patient , may be in breach of the ( code ) , even if the doctor did nothing in circumstances where there was no other obligation to do something , '' he said these conditions included prohibitions on giving advice or information to the public or patients about euthanasia , or nembutal , or suicide , and forcing him to rescind his endorsement of and involvement with the 'peaceful pill ' handbook and related videos in response nitschke , calling the mba 's actions '' a heavy-handed and clumsy attempt to restrict the free flow of information on end-of-life choice '' , surveyed more than 1,000 members of his advocacy group , exit international , and received strong support for ending his medical registration as a consequence of the mba restrictions and the results of the member survey , nitschke publicly burned his medical practising certificate and announced the end of his medical career , vowing to continue to promote euthanasia nitschke stated that he will remain a doctor and will legitimately use the title '' doctor '' ( he has a phd ) , and will continue to see patients and exit members in clinics that he runs in australia and other countries in the wake of this incident , nitschke and his partner , fiona stewart , decided in 2015 to relocate to the more liberal politico-legal environment of holland nitschke states that he and his group are regularly subject to harassment by authorities , including detention and questioning at international airports , and raids on homes and the premises of exit international however , although assisting someone to commit suicide in the uk was illegal , the law did not apply to a person lecturing on the concept of euthanasia , and nitschke was allowed to enter dame joan bakewell , the british government 's '' voice of older people '' , said that the current british law on assisted suicide was '' a mess '' and that nitschke should have been made more welcome in the uk on 1 august 2014 , after euthanasia advocate max bromson , 66 , who suffered from terminal bone tumor , ended his life with nembutal in a glenelg motel room , surrounded by family members , police carried out a three-hour raid on exit international 's adelaide premises , interrogating nitschke and seizing nitschke 's phones , computers and other items in april 2016 british police , acting on an interpol drug alert , forced entry into the home of a member of nitschke 's organisation , retired professor dr avril henry , aged 81 , who was in failing health dr nitschke commented that police had made dr henry 's last days on earth a misery and that “ police need to realise that in the uk , suicide is not a crime , and mental health authorities need to recognise that not everyone who seeks to end their life is in need of psychiatric intervention '' , adding that the police action was '' a significant abuse of power against a vulnerable elderly woman '' in october 2016 new zealand police , in a '' sting '' operation code named '' operation painter '' , set up roadblocks ( checkpoints ) outside an exit international meeting and took down names and addresses of all attendees '' by and large , palliative care have done pretty well out of the argument over the euthanasia issue , because they are the ones that have argued that they just need better funding and then no one will ever want to die – that 's a lie nitschke acknowledged that the information about the drug that was provided online could be accessed by people below the age of 50 who were not terminally ill , but argued that the risk was necessary in order to help the elderly and the seriously ill in another case lucas taylor , 26 , committed suicide in germany by taking nembutal after soliciting advice at an exit international online forum ( which , according to nitschke , he accessed by claiming his age was 65 ) on 22 may 2009 it was disclosed in the press , citing wikileaks , that the australian government had added the online peaceful pill handbook to the blacklist maintained by the australian communications and media authority used to filter internet access to citizens of australia nitschke said the proposals were the '' final nail in the coffin for euthanasia advocacy '' in australia , where people are banned from discussing end-of-life issues over the phone , buying books about it or importing printed material on it on 10 september 2010 nitschke complained that the freetv australia self-regulator of advertising content on australian commercial television had prevented the television screening of a paid advertisement from exit international in which an actor depicted a dying man who requested the option of voluntary euthanasia nitschke was told to provide legal advice outlining how his billboard did not break this law , a request nitschke described as '' ludicrous '' , pointing out that the billboards urge '' political change and in no way could be considered to be in breach of the crimes act '' nitschke created devices to aid people who want euthanasia , including a product called the '' exit bag '' ( a large plastic bag with a drawstring allowing it to be secured around the neck ) and the '' cogen '' ( or '' co-genie '' ) device following a 2013 workshop showcasing nitschke 's nitrogen gas product , the ama 's wa branch president and general practitioner , richard choong , said that he was strongly opposed to it , regardless of its technical legality , since '' any machine that can help you kill yourself can be abused , misused and maliciously used '' in an article in december 2017 about the sarco , newsweek referred to nitschke as '' the elon musk of assisted suicide '' he is a nine-time nominee for australian of the year ( 2005 , 2006 , 2008 , 2009 , 2010 , 2011 , 2012 , 2013 , 2014 ) and twice a state finalist ( 2005 & 2006 ) nitschke 's personal story from his early days , to his activist student days in adelaide , to working with aboriginal land rights groups in australia 's far north ; to his successful campaign to have euthanasia legalised in australia a 2004 documentary film , mademoiselle and the doctor , focused on the quest of a retired perth professor , lisette nigot , a healthy 79-year-old , to seek a successful method of voluntary euthanasia
