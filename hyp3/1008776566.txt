at the start of the second punic war , masinissa fought for carthage against syphax , the king of the masaesyli of western numidia ( present day algeria ) , who had allied himself with the romans having lost the alliance with masinissa , hasdrubal started to look for another ally , which he found in syphax , who married sophonisba , hasdrubal 's daughter , who until the defection had been betrothed to masinissa at the battle of bagbrades ( 203 ) , scipio overcame hasdrubal and syphax and , while the roman general concentrated on carthage , gaius laelius and masinissa followed syphax to cirta , where he was captured and handed over to scipio all through his reign , masinissa extended his territory , and he was cooperating with rome when , towards the end of his life , he provoked carthage to go to war against him in c.206 bc , with fresh reinforcements , mago and hasdrubal gisgo—supported by masinissa 's numidian cavalry—met scipio at the battle of ilipa , where carthage 's power over hispania was forever broken in arguably scipio africanus 's most brilliant victory any hopes he may have had of extending his rule right across north africa were dashed , however , when a roman commission headed by the elderly cato the elder ( cato the elder ) came to africa about 155 bc to decide a territorial dispute between masinissa and carthage after hasdrubal barca departed for italy , masinissa was placed in command of all the carthaginian cavalry in spain , where he fought a successful guerrilla warfare against the roman general scipio africanus ( scipio africanus ) throughout 208 and 207 , while mago barca and hasdrubal gisgo levied and trained new forces at the battle of zama , masinissa commanded the cavalry ( 6,000 numidian and 3,000 roman ) on scipio 's right wing , scipio delayed the engagement long enough to allow for masinissa to join him he showed unconditional loyalty to rome , and his position in africa was strengthened by a clause in the peace treaty of 201 between rome and carthage prohibiting the latter from going to war even in self-defense without roman permission after his victory over syphax , masinissa commanded his skilled numidian cavalry against the romans in spain , where he was involved in the carthaginian victories of castulo and ilorca in 211 bc
