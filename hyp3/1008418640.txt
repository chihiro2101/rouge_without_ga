although his father wished him to apprentice in the dye company , fritz obtained his father 's permission to study chemistry , at the friedrich wilhelm university in berlin ( today the humboldt university of berlin ) , with the director of the institute for chemistry , a haber received his doctorate cum laude from friedrich wilhelm university in may 1891 , after presenting his work to a board of examiners from the university of berlin , since charlottenburg was not yet accredited to grant doctorates in fall of 1892 , haber returned again to breslau to work in his father 's company , but the two men continued to clash and siegfried finally accepted that they could not work well together knorr recommended haber to karl engler , a chemistry professor at the university of karlsruhe who was intensely interested in the chemical technology of dye and the dye industry , and the study of synthetic materials for textiles by making careful quantitative analyses , haber was able to establish that '' the thermal stability of the carbon-carbon bond is greater than that of the carbon-hydrogen bond in aromatic compounds and smaller in aliphatic compounds '' , a classic result in the study of pyrolysis of hydrocarbons bunte and engler supported an application for further authorization of haber 's teaching activities , and on 6 december 1898 , haber was invested with the title of extraordinarius and an associate professorship , by order of the grand duke friedrich von baden after receiving recommendations from a search committee , the ministry of education in baden offered the full professorship for physical chemistry at karlsruhe to fritz haber , who accepted the offer during his time at university of karlsruhe from 1894 to 1911 , haber and his assistant robert le rossignol invented the haber process , which is the catalytic formation of ammonia from hydrogen and atmospheric nitrogen under conditions of high temperature and pressure this discovery was a direct consequence of le châtelier 's principle , announced in 1884 , which states that when a system is in equilibrium and one of the factors affecting it is changed , the system will respond by minimizing the effect of the change after the introduction of the haber process , naturally extracted nitrate production in chile fell from 2.5 million tons ( employing 60,000 workers and selling at us 45/ton ) in 1925 to just 800,000 tons , produced by 14,133 workers , and selling at 19/ton in 1934 haber was awarded the 1918 nobel prize in chemistry for this work ( he actually received the award in 1919 ) in his acceptance speech for that nobel prize haber commented '' it may be that this solution is not the final one haber played a major role in the development of the non-ballistic use of chemical weapons in world war i , in spite of the proscription of their use in shells by the hague convention of 1907 ( to which germany was a signatory ) in addition to leading the teams developing chlorine gas and other deadly gases for use in trench warfare , haber was on hand personally when it was first released by the german military at the second battle of ypres ( 22 april to 25 may 1915 ) in belgium in 1914 and 1915 , before the second battle of ypres , haber 's unit investigated reports that the french had deployed turpenite , a supposed chemical weapon , against german soldiers gas warfare in world war i was , in a sense , the war of the chemists , with haber pitted against french nobel laureate chemist victor grignard regarding war and peace , haber once said , '' during peace time a scientist belongs to the world , but during war time he belongs to his country in his studies of the effects of poison gas , haber noted that exposure to a low concentration of a poisonous gas for a long time often had the same effect ( death ) as exposure to a high concentration for a short time haber defended gas warfare against accusations that it was inhumane , saying that death was death , by whatever means it was inflicted and referred to history : '' the disapproval that the knight had for the man with the firearm is repeated in the soldier who shoots with steel bullets towards the man who confronts him with chemical weapons during the 1920s , scientists working at his institute developed the cyanide gas formulation zyklon a , which was used as an insecticide , especially as a fumigant in grain stores haber received much criticism for his involvement in the development of chemical weapons in pre-world war ii germany , both from contemporaries , especially albert einstein and from modern-day scientists clara was the daughter of a chemist who owned a sugar factory , and was the first woman to earn a phd ( in chemistry ) at the university of breslau according to this view , her suicide may have been in part a response to haber 's having personally overseen the first successful use of chlorine gas during the second battle of ypres , resulting in over 67,000 casualties his oldest daughter , claire , committed suicide in 1949 ; also a chemist , she had been told her research into an antidote for the effects of chlorine gas was being set aside , as work on the atomic bomb was taking precedence fritz haber 's other son , ludwig fritz haber ( 1921–2004 ) , became an eminent british economist and wrote a history of chemical warfare in world war i , the poisonous cloud ( 1986 ) from 1919 to 1923 haber continued to be involved in germany 's secret development of chemical weapons , working with hugo stoltzenberg , and helping both spain and russia in the development of chemical gases from 1919 to 1925 , in response to a request made by german ambassador to japan wilhelm solf for japanese support for german scholars in times of financial hardship , a japanese businessman named hoshi hajime , the president of hoshi pharmaceutical company donated two million reichsmark to the kaiser wilhelm society as the ‘ japan fund ’ ( hoshi-ausschuss ) the money from the fund was used to support the work of richard willstätter , max planck , otto hahn , leo szilard , and others in the 1920s , haber searched exhaustively for a method to extract gold from sea water , and published a number of scientific papers on the subject as of 30 april 1933 , haber wrote to bernhard rust , the national and prussian minister of education , and to max planck , president of the kaiser wilhelm society , to tender his resignation as the director of the kaiser wilhelm institute , and as a professor at the university , effective 1 october 1933 in the meantime , some of the scientists who had been haber 's counterparts and competitors in england during world war i now helped him and others to leave germany in 1981 , the minerva foundation of the max planck society and the hebrew university of jerusalem ( huji ) established the fritz haber research center for molecular dynamics , based at the institute of chemistry of the hebrew university the institute most closely associated with his work , the former kaiser wilhelm institute for physical chemistry and electrochemistry at dahlem ( a suburb of berlin ) , was renamed
