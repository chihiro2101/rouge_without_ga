crucibles used for copper smelting were generally wide shallow vessels made from clay that lacks refractory properties which is similar to the types of clay used in other ceramics of the time lang , eds , mining and metal production through the ages , british museum press , london , pp93–100 ceramic crucibles from this time had slight modifications to their designs such as handles , knobs or pouring spouts ( bayley & rehren 2007 : p47 ) allowing them to be more easily handled and poured these crucibles have added handles to allow for better manipulation , however , due to the poor preservation of the crucibles there is no evidence of a pouring spout the use of crucibles in the iron age remains very similar to that of the bronze age with copper and tin smelting being used to produce bronze during the roman period a new process of metalworking started , cementation , used in the production of brass cementation crucibles , therefore , have a lid or cap which limits the amount of gas loss from the crucible the crucible design is similar to the smelting and melting crucibles of the period utilizing the same material as the smelting and melting crucibles smelting and melting of copper and its alloys such as leaded bronze were smelted in crucibles similar to those of the roman period which have thinner walls and flat bases to sit within the furnaces , 1995 , early metal mining and production , edinburgh university press ltd , edinburgh however , during this period a vast and highly important technological innovation happened using the cementation process , the production of crucible steel the first examples of cementation steel are wootz steel from india ( craddock 1995 : p276 ) , where the crucibles were filled with good quality low-carbon wrought iron and carbon in the form of organics such as leaves , wood , etc by the late medieval period , steel production had moved from india to modern-day uzbekistan where new materials were being used in the production of steel crucibles , for example , mullite crucibles were introduced , 2000 , cutting edge technology – the ferghana process of medieval crucible steel smelting , metalla , bochum , 7 ( 2 ) pp55–69 these were sandy clay crucibles which had been formed around a fabric tube these crucibles were used in the same way as other cementation vessels but with a hole in the top of the vessel to allow pressure to escape , 2009 , post-medieval crucible production and distribution : a study of materials and materialities , archaeometry vol.51 no.1 pp49–74 furthermore , another specialized crucible which was made at the same time was that of a graphite crucible from southern germany the refining of methods during the medieval and post-medieval periods led to the invention of the cupel which resembles a small egg cup , made of ceramic or bone ash which was used to separate base metals from noble metals another vessel used for the same process is a scorifier which is similar to a cupel but slightly larger and removes the lead and leaves the noble metals behind these vessels were also used in the process of metallurgical assay where the noble metals are removed from a coin or a weight of metal to determine the amount of the noble metals within the object file : czochralski method crucibles.jpg thumb crucibles used in czochralski method 300x300px file : melting crucible.jpg thumb melting gold in a graphite crucible 300x300px file : menlo lab cruicibles.jpg thumb three crucibles used by thomas edison 300x300px crucible is used in the laboratory to contain chemical compounds when heated to extremely high temperatures crucibles and their covers are made of high temperature-resistant materials , usually porcelain , alumina or an inert metal after some possible washing and/or pre-drying of this filtrate , the residue on the filter paper can be placed in the crucible and fired ( heated at very high temperature ) until all the volatiles and moisture are driven out of the sample residue in the crucible the mass of the empty , pre-weighed crucible and lid is subtracted from this result to yield the mass of the completely dried residue in the crucible at least two firings , coolings , and weighings resulting in exactly the same mass are needed to confirm the constant ( completely dry ) mass of the crucible and lid and similarly again for the crucible , lid , and sample residue inside , 2009 , post medieval crucible production and distribution : a study of materials and materialities , archaeometry vol.51 no.1 pp49–74 o
