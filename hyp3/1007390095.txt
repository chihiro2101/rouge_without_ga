peterson initiated a new '' team '' approach to the design and manufacture of automobiles at ford , that eventually resulted in the creation of the ford taurus in a letter to autoweek , donald petersen , then ford chairman , said , '' we are moving toward building a quality culture at ford and the many changes that have been taking place here have their roots directly in deming 's teachings the new york advertising firm wells , rich , greene took on the ford account in 1979 and robert cox was assigned to the ford account and by the summer of 1981 , “ quality is job 1 ” became ford 's calling card in marketing ) the release of the ford taurus was one of the most anticipated ever , mostly because it was a first in car design and also the start of new quality standards for ford at the time of the taurus 's debut , ford had been producing mainly rear-wheel drive cars , and chrysler and general motors were offering more front-wheel drive vehicles up to midrange including the chrysler k platform and a-body chevrolet celebrity the taurus displayed a rounder shape than its contemporaries , often likened to a 'jelly bean ' or 'flying potato ' , inspired by the design of the audi 5000 and ford 's european sedan , the ford sierra , an updated appearance of a styling approach used in the late 1940s to early 1960s called '' ponton '' styling for example , the switches to the power windows and power locks were designed with one half of the switch raised up , with the other half recessed , in order for its function to be identified by touch the most basic model , the l ( see below ) , came standard , with just an am radio and a front cloth bench seat , while the lx , the more luxurious model , came with a greater number of features as standard equipment it won many awards , most notably being named to the 1986 car and driver 10best and becoming the 1986 motor trend car of the year over 200,000 of the taurus were sold during the 1986 model year and the millionth taurus was sold during the 1989 model year as part of the redesign , the ford taurus gained a passenger-side airbag as an option , which became standard in 1993 on 1994 models , becoming the first mid-size sedan sold in the united states with standard dual airbags the second generation sold just as well as the first , becoming the best-selling car in the united states , a title it would retain for as long as this generation was sold in a break from the familiar styling of the previous two generations ( that chief designer jack telnack had likened to a '' pair of slippers '' ) , ford had sought to again make the taurus stand out for buyers of mid-size sedans , giving the vehicle a much more extensive restyling than its 1992 predecessor alongside the ford blue oval emblem itself , the taurus repeated the shape several places in its exterior ; in a controversial design element , the rear window of the taurus was oval , as were the side windows of the mercury sable to simplify production , all versions of the taurus were fitted with bucket seats ; six-passenger versions were fitted with a flip-forward center seat cushion also meant for use as a center console ; five-passenger versions were fitted with a floor shifter and center console at the time , 51-percent of all taurus sales for 1996 went to rental fleets , in contrast to the honda accord and toyota camry , of which most sales were to private customers through car dealership for 1996 , ford australia imported the ford taurus sedan as the '' taurus ghia '' alongside its locally produced ford falcon el , but imports ceased after only one year due to poor sales to reduce the car 's price and keep it competitive , ford reduced costs on the car in 1999 , such as giving the taurus sedan rear drum brakes on abs equipped vehicles ( previously , upgrading to abs included the addition of rear disc brakes ) , eliminating the dual exhaust on the higher end models , and trimming many other small features the '' integrated control panel '' concept was carried over but redesigned , with a bigger , squarer shape , and it was placed in the center of the dash instead of being angled toward the driver having already lost its status as the best selling car in america when it was surpassed by the honda accord and toyota camry in 1997 , by 2005 it has fallen to fourth-place behind the nissan altima , which made ford decide to discontinue the entire taurus line production of the taurus wagon was discontinued on december 8 , 2004 ; sedan retail sales halted after a short 2006 model year , and the taurus became sold exclusively to fleets in the united states , while still being sold to retail customers in canada production ended on october 27 , 2006 , as ford idled the atlanta plant , as part of its '' the way forward '' restructuring plan the taurus was replaced in ford 's lineup by the five hundred and fusion sedans , while the taurus wagon was replaced by the freestyle crossover suv analysts , customers and some interviewed ford employees criticized the company for failing to invest in the car and keep it competitive , instead focusing all of its resources on developing and marketing trucks and suvs a usa today editorial entitled '' how ford starved its taurus '' noted that the taurus ' death was part of a broader trend of the detroit big three willingly abandoning once-successful nameplates and divisions in search of '' the next big thing '' , while their foreign competitors have been gaining market share by continuously improving their veteran nameplates newly-hired ford ceo alan mulally expressed similar opinions , telling the associated press the decision '' perplexed '' him when he learned about it ; he recalled asking subordinates , '' how can it go away ? it 's the best selling car in america ! '' as the successor five hundred was struggling in the marketplace , mulally viewed the decision to discontinue the taurus as a '' mistake that needed to be fixed '' , noting , '' the customers want it back partially blaming the five hundred 's struggles on its name , mulally decided that the revised vehicle should be marketed as the taurus , the name he believed the five hundred sedan should have used from the beginning as he believed ford was better off continuing to use its older nameplates that maintained decent brand equity rather than trying to build up new ones the revised five hundred and freestyle were showcased as the taurus and taurus x , respectively , at the 2007 chicago auto show and went on sale that summer the fifth generation ( 5g ) taurus entered production in 2007 as a 2008 model and was developed directly from the ford five hundred , chiefly with a mild exterior facelift and revised engine and transmission it was determined that ford 's strategy to redesignate new cars in the lineup with new names beginning with the letter f , as in ford focus , ford fusion , and ford taurus x , was not a good marketing move , as some of the renamed cars had highly recognizable iconic names however , others criticized the lack of interior room and reduced sight lines despite its full-sized exterior , and edmunds noted that the eighth-generation honda accord ( which competes in the mid-size category ) had superior driving dynamics and a more efficient design and offered almost as much interior space as the taurus despite considerably smaller external dimensions there was also an available performance package which included upgraded brake pads , a 3.16:1 final drive ratio ( compared to the standard 2.77:1 ) , recalibrated electronic power steering , further suspension tuning , a re-calibrated advancetrac system ( ford 's combined traction control system and electronic stability control ) with sport mode and '' true off '' , summer compound goodyear eagle f1 245/45zr20 tire , and an electric air pump with fix-a-flat in lieu of a spare tire on april 25 , 2018 , ford announced plans to discontinue the taurus ( along with the fiesta , focus , and fusion ) , in order to focus more on its line of trucks and suvs “ ford stops national ads for sedans , including fusion still in production ” from automotive news ( september 5 , 2018 ) on march 1 , 2019 , the last ford taurus built in the united states rolled off of the assembly line at the ford chicago plant serving as the flagship of the changan ford joint venture , the taurus is an extended-wheelbase variant of the ford fusion ( mondeo ) , differing primarily in its 3.9-inch longer wheelbase and formal rear roofline the standard engine is a 2.0l ecoboost inline-4 ( an option for the sixth-generation taurus ) and a 2.7l ecoboost v6 ( used in the fusion and lincoln continental ) ; a 6-speed automatic is paired to both engines
