the majority of the inhabitants appear to have been members of the sotho people ( colonial form basuto ) , but in the valleys of the orange and vaal were korana and other khoikhoi , and in the drakensberg and on the western border lived numbers of bushmen in 1824 farmers of dutch , huguenots and german descent known as voortrekkers ( later named boers by the english ) emerged from the cape colony , seeking pasture for their flocks and to escape british governmental oversight , settling in the country the leader of the first large party , hendrik potgieter , concluded an agreement with makwana , the chief of the bataung tribe of batswana , ceding to the farmers the country between the vet and vaal rivers when boer families first reached the area they discovered that the country had been devastated , in the northern parts by the chief mzilikazi and his matabele in what was known as the mfecane , and also by the difaqane , in which three tribes roamed across the land attacking settled groups , absorbing them and their resources until they collapsed because of their sheer size after the defeat of mzilikazi the town of winburg ( so named by the boers in commemoration of their victory ) was founded , a volksraad elected , and piet retief , one of the ablest of the voortrekkers , chosen “ governor and commandant-general ” by these treaties , which recognised native sovereignty over large areas on which boer farmers were settled , the british sought to keep a check on the boers and to protect both the natives and cape colony the year in which the treaty with moshoeshoe was made , several large parties of boers recrossed the drakensberg into the country north of the orange , refusing to remain in natal when the british annexed the newly formed boer republic of natalia to form the colony of natal during their stay in natal the boers inflicted a severe defeat on the zulus under dingane in the battle of blood river in december 1838 , which , following on the flight of mzilikazi , greatly strengthened the position of moshoeshoe , whose power became a menace to that of the boer farmers this fact induced mr justice menzies , one of the judges of the cape colony then on circuit at colesberg , to cross the orange and proclaim the country british territory in october 1842 the majority of the boer farmers in kok 's territory sent a deputation to the british commissioner in natal , henry cloete , asking for equal treatment with the griquas , and expressing the desire to come under british protection under such terms british troops moved up to support the griquas , and after a skirmish at zwartkopjes ( 2 may 1845 ) a new arrangement was made between kok and peregrine maitland , the then governor of cape colony , virtually placing the administration of his territory in the hands of a british resident , a post filled in 1846 by captain henry douglas warden the volksraad at winburg during this period continued to claim jurisdiction over the boers living between the orange and the vaal and was in federation with the volksraad at potchefstroom , which made a similar claim upon the great boers living north of the vaal he recognised the failure of the attempt to govern on the lines of the treaties with the griquas and basotho , and on 3 february 1848 he issued a proclamation declaring british sovereignty over the country between the orange and the vaal eastward to the drakensberg the british government ( under first russell ministry ) , which had reluctantly agreed to the annexation of the country , had , however , already repented its decision and had resolved to abandon the sovereignty lord henry grey , secretary of state for war and the colonies , in a dispatch to sir harry smith dated 21 october 1851 , declared , '' the ultimate abandonment of the orange sovereignty should be a settled point in our policy '' and then , '' wrote george mccall theal , '' was seen forced the strange spectacle of an english commissioner addressing men who wished to be free of british control as the friendly and well-disposed inhabitants , while for those who desired to remain british subjects and who claimed that protection to which they believed themselves entitled he had no sympathising word the orange river convention , recognising the independence of the country , was signed at bloemfontein on 23 february by sir george clerk and the republican committee , and in march the boer government assumed office and the republican flag was hoisted five days later the representatives of the elected delegates had an interview in london with the colonial secretary , the duke of newcastle , who informed them that it was now too late to discuss the question of the retention of british rule the first president was josias philip hoffman , but he was accused of being too complaisant towards moshoeshoe and resigned , being succeeded in 1855 by jacobus nicolaas boshoff , one of the voortrekkers , who had previously taken an active part in the affairs of the natalia republic distracted among themselves , with the formidable basotho power on their southern and eastern flank , the troubles of the infant state were speedily added to by the action of the transvaal boers of the south african republic '' several of the malcontents in the orange free state who had joined pretorius permanently settled in the transvaal , and other orange free staters who had been guilty of high treason were arrested and punished many of the burghers would have at this time welcomed union with the transvaal , but learning from sir george grey that such a union would nullify the conventions of 1852 and 1854 and necessitate the reconsideration of great britain 's policy towards the native tribes north of the orange and vaal rivers , the project was dropped a treaty was signed at thaba bosiu in april 1866 , but war again broke out in 1867 , and the free state attracted to its side a large number of adventurers from all parts of south africa the intervention of the governor of cape colony led to the conclusion of the treaty of aliwal north ( 12 february 1869 ) , which defined the borders between the orange free state and basutoland the country lying to the north of the orange river and west of the caledon river , formerly a part of basutoland , was ceded to the orange free state , and became known as the conquered territory by the sand river convention , independence had been granted to the boers living '' north of the vaal '' , and the dispute turned on the question as to what stream constituted the true upper course of that river in the years 1870–1871 a large number of foreign diggers had settled on the diamond fields near the junction of the vaal and orange rivers , which were situated in part on land claimed by the griqua chief nicholas waterboer and by the orange free state the offer was accepted , and on 27 october 1871 the district , together with some adjacent territory to which the transvaal had laid claim , was proclaimed , under the name of griqualand west , british territory waterboer 's claims were based on the treaty concluded by his father with the british in 1834 , and on various arrangements with the kok chiefs ; the free state based its claim on its purchase of adam kok 's sovereign rights and on long occupation it was then disposed of by henry herbert , 4th earl of carnarvon , at that time secretary of state for the colonies , who granted to the free state a £90,000 payment '' in full satisfaction of all claims which it considers it may possess to griqualand west the relations between the british and the orange free state , after the question of the boundary was settled , remained perfectly amicable down to the outbreak of the second boer war in 1899 in spite of the neutral attitude taken by their government a number of the orange free state boers , living in the northern part of the country , went to the transvaal and joined their brethren then in arms against the british the renewal of the policy of british expansion had been answered by the formation of the afrikaner bond , which represented the aspirations of the afrikaner people , and had active branches in the free state in 1889 an agreement made between the orange free state and the cape colony government , whereby the latter was empowered to extend , at its own cost , its railway system to bloemfontein the convention was the outcome of a conference held at cape town in 1888 , at which delegates from natal , the free state and the cape colony attended reitz had no sooner got into office than a meeting was arranged with paul kruger , president of the south african republic , at which various terms were discussed and decided upon regarding an agreement dealing with the railways , terms of a treaty of amity and commerce , and what was called a political treaty the political treaty referred in general terms to a federal union between the south african republic and the orange free state , and bound each of them to help the other , whenever the independence of either should be assailed or threatened from without , unless the state so called upon for assistance should be able to show the injustice of the cause of quarrel in which the other state had engaged a further offensive and defensive alliance between the two republics was then entered into , under which the orange free state took up arms on the outbreak of hostilities between the british and the south african republic in october 1899 it was on this occasion that kruger , referring to the london convention , spoke of queen victoria as a kwaaje vrouw ( angry woman ) , an expression which caused a good deal of offence in england at the time , but which , in the phraseology of the boers , was not meant by paul kruger as insulting in 1898 the free state also acquiesced in the new convention arranged with regard to the customs union between the cape colony , natal , basutoland and the bechuanaland protectorate the orange free state began to expel british subjects in 1899 , and the first act of the second boer war was committed by orange free state boers , who , on 11 october 1899 , seized a train upon the border belonging to natal after the surrender of piet cronjé in the battle of paardeberg on 27 february 1900 , bloemfontein was occupied by the british troops under lord roberts from 13 march onward , and on 28 may a proclamation was issued annexing the free state to the british dominions under the title of orange river colony postal orders
