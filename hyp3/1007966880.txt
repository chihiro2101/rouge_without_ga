shenandoah was assembled at naval air station lakehurst , new jersey in 1922–1923 , in hangar no nas lakehurst had served as a base for navy blimps for some time , but shenandoah was the first rigid airship to join the fleet the membranes were washed and scraped to remove fat and dirt , and then placed in a solution of water and glycerine in preparation for application to the rubberized cotton fabric providing the strength of the gas cells as the first rigid airship to use helium rather than hydrogen , shenandoah had a significant edge in safety over previous airships —the next rigid airship to enter navy service , originally built by luftschiffbau zeppelin in germany as lz 126—was at first filled with the helium from shenandoah until more could be procured the first frame of shenandoah was erected by 24 june 1922 ; on 20 august 1923 , the completed airship was floated free of the ground edwin denby , wife of the secretary of the navy , and commissioned on the same day with commander frank r denby named the airship after her home in the shenandoah valley of virginia , and the word '' shenandoah '' was then believed to be a native american word meaning '' daughter of stars '' on 27 october , shenandoah celebrated navy day with a flight down the shenandoah valley and returned to lakehurst that night by way of washington and baltimore , where crowds gathered to see the new airship in the beams of searchlights moffett , chief of the bureau of aeronautics and staunch advocate of the airship , was discussing the possibility of using shenandoah to explore the arctic president calvin coolidge approved moffett 's proposal , but shenandoahs upper tail fin covering ripped during a gale on 16 january 1924 , and the sudden roll tore her away from the lakehurst mast , ripping out her mooring winches , deflating the first helium cell and puncturing the second in july 1924 , the oiler put in at norfolk naval shipyard for extensive modifications to become the navy 's first airship tender an experimental mooring mast above the water was constructed ; additional accommodations both for the crew of shenandoah and for the men who would handle and supply the airship were added ; facilities for the helium , gasoline , and other supplies necessary for shenandoah were built , as well as handling and stowage facilities for three seaplanes this was the first flight of a rigid airship across north america on 2 september 1925 , shenandoah departed lakehurst on a promotional flight to the midwest that would include flyovers of 40 cities and visits to state fairs while passing through an area of thunderstorms and turbulence over ohio early in the morning of 3 september , during its 57th flight , the airship was caught in a violent updraft that carried it beyond the pressure limits of its gas bags this included every member of the crew of the control car ( except for lieutenant anderson , who escaped before it detached and fell from the ship ) ; two men who fell through holes in the hull ; and several mechanics who fell with the engines in this group was anderson who—until he was roped in by the others—straddled the catwalk over a hole the rough outline of the stern is marked with a series of concrete blocks , and a sign marking the site is visible from the freeway still , a local farmer on whose property part of the vessel 's wreckage lay began charging the throngs of visitors to enter the crash site at a rate of 1 ( equivalent to about 13.60 in 2015 ) for each automobile and 25¢ per pedestrian as well as 10¢ for a drink of water official inquiry brought to light the fact that the fatal flight had been made under protest by commander lansdowne ( a native of greenville , ohio ) , who had warned the navy department of the violent weather conditions that were common to that area of ohio in late summer death of a dirigible www.americanheritage.com this event was the trigger for army colonel billy mitchell to heavily criticize the leadership of both the army and the navy , leading directly to his court-martial for insubordination and the end of his military career these valves had been removed in order to better preserve the vessel 's helium , which at that time was considered a limited global resource of great rarity and strategic military importance ; without these valves , the helium contained in the rising gas bags had expanded too quickly for the bags ' valves ' design capacity , causing the bags to tear apart the hull as they ruptured ( of course , the helium which had been contained in these bags became lost into the upper atmosphere ) the crash of the shenandoah was popularized by the songs the hand of fate , written in 1925 by eugene spencer and don drew , spencer , eugene , and don drew , '' seeing america from the 'shenandoah ' '' , national geographic , january 1925 ill wind : the naval airship shenandoah in noble county , ohio '' america 's airship disaster '' : the crash of the uss shenandoah howard , ohio : little river publishing , vadm usn '' comment and discussion '' united states naval institute proceedings august 1978 '' the shenandoah adventure '' a brief official account of the accident flight 21 february 1924 , pp uss shenandoah at airships.net : photos and history history.navy.mil : uss shenandoah ( zr-1 ) naval historical center article and images of construction article and images during service aviation : from sand dunes to sonic booms , a national park service discover our shared heritage travel itinerary 'the wreck of the shenandoah , 1925 song by vernon dalhart noble county ohio page on the uss shenandoah disaster america 's forgotten airship disaster : the crash of the uss shenandoah
