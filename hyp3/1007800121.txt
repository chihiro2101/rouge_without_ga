the etruscan civilization , which dominated a territory including the area which now includes rome from perhaps 900 to 100 bc , like many other european peoples , had buried its dead in excavated underground chambers , such as the tomb of the capitals , and less complex tumuli in contrast , the original roman custom had been cremation of the human body , after which the burnt remains were kept in a pot , urn or ash-chest , often deposited in a columbarium or dovecote from about the 2nd century ad , inhumation ( burial of unburnt human remains ) became customary , either in graves or , for those who could afford them , in sarcophagi , often elaborately carved it also had a variety of significance for christians , for whom it was not only a common food , as for other romans , but featured as a symbol in christian iconography and was consumed at meals held to commemorate the dead roman law forbade burial places within city limits and so all burial places , including the catacombs , were located outside the walls of the city they were carved in tufa , a type of volcanic rock which is relatively soft to dig into but subsequently hardens , christian catacombs existed as a burial ground for early christians accompanied by inscriptions and early wall art from the first to the sixth century , the art in roman christian catacombs progressively went into phases as well : an early phase , an old testament phase , and a new testament phase in the 6th century catacombs were used only for martyrs ’ memorial services , though some paintings were added as late as the 7th century , for example a saint stephen in the catacomb of commodilla responsibility for the christian catacombs lies with the holy see , which has set up active official organizations for this purpose : the pontifical commission of sacred archaeology ( pontificia commissione di archeologia sacra ) directs excavations and restoration works , while study of the catacombs is directed in particular by the pontifical academy of archaeology in the last years , with the growth of the internet , updated information is often available online , with indication of current street address , opening hours , fees , availability of guides in the different languages , size of groups permitted and public transport like other historical sites in italy , the catacombs are often not accessible at certain times of the day or on certain days of the week and may require online prebooking the roman catacombs , of which there are forty in the suburbs or former suburbs , were built along the consular roads out of rome , such as the via appia , the via ostiensis , the via labicana , the via tiburtina , and the via nomentana in the beginning of 2009 , at the request of the vatican , the divine word missionaries , a roman catholic society of priests and brothers , assumed responsibility as administrator of st located on the campana road , these catacombs are said to have been the resting place , perhaps temporarily , of simplicius , faustinus and beatrix , christian martyrs who died in rome during the diocletian persecution ( 302 or 303 ) in the oldest parts of the complex may be found the '' cubiculum of the coronation '' , with a rare depiction for that period of christ being crowned with thorns , and a 4th-century painting of susanna and the old men in the allegorical guise of a lamb and wolves it takes its name from the deacon saint callixtus , proposed by pope zephyrinus in the administration of the same cemetery – on his accession as pope , he enlarged the complex , that quite soon became the official one for the roman church one of the smallest christian cemeteries , this has always been one of the most accessible catacombs and is thus one of the least preserved ( of the four original floors , the first is almost completely gone ) on the left hand end of the right hand wall of the nave of the primitive basilica , rebuilt in 1933 on ancient remains , arches to end the middle of the nave of the actual church , built in the 13th century , are visible , along with the outside of the apse of the chapel of the relics ;
