one of the doctors attending him was hugh cairns , a neurosurgeon , who after lawrence 's death began a long study of what he saw as the unnecessary loss of life by motorcycle despatch riders through head injuries a 2008 systematic study showed that helmets reduce the risk of head injury by around 69 % and the risk of death by around 42 % all of these types of helmets are secured by a chin strap , and their protective benefits are greatly reduced , if not eliminated , if the chin strap is not securely fastened so as to maintain a snug fit a full face helmet covers the entire head , with a rear that covers the base of the skull , and a protective section over the front of the chin such helmets have an open cutout in a band across the eyes and nose , and often include a clear or tinted transparent plastic face shield , known as a visor , that generally swivels up and down to allow access to the face dietmar otte , hannover medical university , department of traffic accident research , germany wearing a helmet with less coverage eliminates that protection â€” the less coverage the helmet offers , the less protection for the rider thumb the motocross and off-road helmet has clearly elongated chin and visor portions , a chin bar , and partially open face to give the rider extra protection while wearing goggles and to allow the unhindered flow of air during the physical exertion typical of this type of riding originally , off-road helmets did not include a chin bar , with riders using helmets very similar to modern open face street helmets , and using a face mask to fend off dirt and debris from the nose and mouth its chin bar may be pivoted upwards ( or , in some cases , may be removed ) by a special lever to allow access to most of the face , as in an open face helmet the curved shape of an open chin bar and face shield section can cause increased wind drag during riding , as air will not flow around an open modular helmet in the same way as a three-quarters helmet since the chin bar section also protrudes further from the forehead than a three-quarters visor , riding with the helmet in the open position may pose increased risk of neck injury in a crash observation and unofficial testing suggest that significantly greater protection exists beyond that for an open face helmet , and may be enough to pass full-face helmet standardized tests , but the extent of protection is not fully established by all standards bodies ece 22.05 allows certification of modular helmets with or without chin bar tests , distinguished by -p ( protective lower face cover ) and -np ( non-protective ) suffixes to the certification number , and additional warning text for non-certified chin bars the open face , or '' three-quarters '' , helmet covers the ears , cheeks , and back of the head , but lacks the lower chin bar of the full face helmet the half helmet , also referred to as a '' shorty '' in the united states and '' pudding basin '' or tt helmet in the uk classic motorcycling : a guide for the 21st century by rex bunn there are other types of headwear often called '' beanies , '' '' brain buckets '' , or '' novelty helmets '' , a term which arose since they are uncertified and can not legally be called motorcycle helmets in some jurisdictions '' abstract , quick summary conversely , another study , the maids report , did not back up the claims that helmet color makes any difference in accident frequency , and that in fact motorcycles painted white were actually over-represented in the accident sample compared to the exposure data while recognizing how much riders need to be seen , the maids report documented that riders ' clothing usually fails to do so , saying that '' in 65.3 % of all cases , the clothing made no contribution to the conspicuity of the rider or the ptw powered two-wheeler , i.e motorcycle helmets are generally designed to distort in a crash ( thus expending the energy otherwise destined for the wearer 's skull ) , so they provide little protection at the site of their first impact , but continued protection over the remainder of the helmet some of the plastics offer very good protection from penetration as in lexan ( bulletproof glass ) but will not crush on impact , so the outer shell will look undamaged but the inner eps will be crushed the conventional motorcycle helmet has two principal protective components : a thin , hard , outer shell typically made from polycarbonate plastic , fiberglass , or kevlar and a soft , thick , inner liner usually made of expanded polystyrene or polypropylene '' eps '' foam the purpose of the hard outer shell is : to prevent penetration of the helmet by a pointed object that might otherwise puncture the skull , and to provide structure to the inner liner so it does not disintegrate upon abrasive contact with pavement the purpose of the foam liner is to crush during an impact , thereby increasing the distance and period of time over which the head stops and reducing its deceleration thumb motorcycle helmets greatly reduce injuries and fatalities in motorcycle accidents , the effect of the 1992 california motorcycle helmet use law on motorcycle crash fatalities and injuries 22 contained requirements concerning coverage of the head , field of vision , hearing for the user , projections from the helmet , and durability of materials , as well as a series of tests regarding cold , heat and moisture treatments , shock absorption , penetration , rigidity , chinstraps and flammability the standard also describes how helmets must be labeled , including with such information as how to wear and clean the helmet , its size and mass , and warnings to replace the helmet after a violent impact while motorcyclists frequently ride at speeds higher than 20 & nbsp ; m/s ( 45 & nbsp ; mph ) , the perpendicular impact speed of the helmet is usually not the same as the road speed of the motorcycle , and the severity of the impact is determined not only by the speed of the head but also by the surface it hits and the angle of impact since the surface of the road is almost parallel to the direction a motorcyclist moves while driving , only a small component of their velocity is directed perpendicularly ( though other surfaces may be perpendicular to the motorcyclist 's velocity , such as trees , walls , and the sides of other vehicles ) since there is a wide range of severity in the impacts that could happen in a motorcycle accident , some will be more severe than the impacts used in the standard tests and some will be less .
