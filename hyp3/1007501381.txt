william phillips , a new zealand born economist , wrote a paper in 1958 titled the relation between unemployment and the rate of change of money wage rates in the united kingdom , 1861-1957 , which was published in the quarterly journal economica in the paper phillips describes how he observed an inverse relationship between money wage changes and unemployment in the british economy over the period examined similar patterns were found in other countries and in 1960 paul samuelson and robert solow took phillips ' work and made explicit the link between inflation and unemployment : when inflation was high , unemployment was low , and vice versa in the years following phillips ' 1958 paper , many economists in the advanced industrial countries believed that his results showed that there was a permanently stable relationship between inflation and unemployment '' as samuelson and solow had argued 8 years earlier , he argued that in the long run , workers and employers will take inflation into account , resulting in employment contracts that increase pay at rates near anticipated inflation there is no single curve that will fit the data , but there are three rough aggregations—1955–71 , 1974–84 , and 1985–92—each of which shows a general , downwards slope , but at three very different levels with the shifts occurring abruptly this is because in the short run , there is generally an inverse relationship between inflation and the unemployment rate ; as illustrated in the downward sloping short-run phillips curve in the long run , that relationship breaks down and the economy eventually returns to the natural rate of unemployment regardless of the inflation rate the '' short-run phillips curve '' is also called the '' expectations-augmented phillips curve '' , since it shifts up when inflationary expectations rise , edmund phelps and milton friedman argued in the long run , this implies that monetary policy can not affect unemployment , which adjusts back to its '' natural rate '' , also called the '' nairu '' or '' long-run phillips curve '' however , this long-run '' neutrality '' of monetary policy does allow for short run fluctuations and the ability of the monetary authority to temporarily decrease unemployment by increasing permanent inflation , and vice versa as keynes mentioned : '' a government has to remember , however , that even if a tax is not prohibited it may be unprofitable , and that a medium , rather than an extreme , imposition will yield the greatest gain '' in these macroeconomic models with sticky prices , there is a positive relation between the rate of inflation and the level of demand , and therefore a negative relation between the rate of inflation and the rate of unemployment this equation tells us that the growth of money wages rises with the trend rate of growth of money wages ( indicated by the superscript t ) and falls with the unemployment rate ( u ) the latter theory , also known as the '' natural rate of unemployment '' , distinguished between the '' short-term '' phillips curve and the '' long-term '' one in the long run , only a single rate of unemployment ( the nairu or '' natural '' rate ) was consistent with a stable inflation rate however , according to the nairu , exploiting this short-run trade-off will raise inflation expectations , shifting the short-run curve rightward to the '' new short-run phillips curve '' and moving the point of equilibrium from b to c thus the reduction in unemployment below the '' natural rate '' will be temporary , and lead only to higher inflation in the long run this , in turn , suggested that the short-run period was so short that it was non-existent : any effort to reduce unemployment below the nairu , for example , would immediately cause inflationary expectations to rise and thus imply that the policy would fail furthermore , the concept of rational expectations had become subject to much doubt when it became clear that the main assumption of models based on it was that there exists a single ( unique ) equilibrium in the economy that is set ahead of time , determined independently of demand conditions it is not that high inflation causes low unemployment ( as in milton friedman 's theory ) as much as vice versa : low unemployment raises worker bargaining power , allowing them to successfully push for higher nominal wages similarly , built-in inflation is not simply a matter of subjective '' inflationary expectations '' but also reflects the fact that high inflation can gather momentum and continue beyond the time when it was started , due to the objective price/wage spiral they reject the phillips curve entirely , concluding that unemployment 's influence is only a small portion of a much larger inflation picture that includes prices of raw materials , intermediate goods , cost of raising capital , worker productivity , land , and other factors gordon of northwestern university has analyzed the phillips curve to produce what he calls the triangle model , in which the actual inflation rate is determined by the sum of demand pull inflation , cost push inflation , and built-in inflation in between these two lies the nairu , where the phillips curve does not have any inherent tendency to shift , so that the inflation rate is stable federal reserve bank of boston , '' understanding inflation and the implications for monetary policy : a phillips curve retrospective '' , frbb conference series 53 , june 9–11 , 2008 , chatham , massachusetts m friedman , ‘ the role of monetary policy ’ ( 1968 ) 58 ( 1 ) american economic review 1 e mcgaughey , 'will robots automate your job away ? full employment , basic income , and economic democracy ' ( 2018 ) ssrn , part 2 ( 1 ) a phillips , ‘ the relation between unemployment and the rate of change of money wage rates in the united kingdom 1861–1957 ’ ( 1958 ) 25 economica 283 left critique of phillips curve from dollars & sense magazine a critique of the phillips curve by charles oliver , ludwig von mises institute , february 9 , 1999 ( includes the article '' who 's afraid of a red-hot economy ?
