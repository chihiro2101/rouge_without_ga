metastasis involves a complex series of steps in which cancer cells leave the original tumor site and migrate to other parts of the body via the bloodstream , via the lymphatic system , or by direct extension it is theorized that metastasis always coincides with a primary cancer , and , as such , is a tumor that started from a cancer cell or cells in another part of the body in these cases , doctors refer to the primary tumor as '' unknown '' or '' occult , '' and the patient is said to have cancer of unknown primary origin ( cup ) or unknown primary tumors ( upt ) file : bone

the systemic venous system at the venous angle and into the brachiocephalic veins , and therefore these metastatic cells can also eventually spread through the haematogenous route the choice of treatment depends on many factors , including the type of primary cancer , the size and location of the metastases , the patient 's age and general health , and the types of treatments used previously when a second tumor is found in a patient that has been treated for cancer in the past , it is more often a metastasis than another primary tumor in lymph nodes metastasis , a common symptom is lymphadenopathy lung metastasis : cough , hemoptysis and dyspnea ( shortness of breath ) liver metastasis : hepatomegaly ( enlarged liver ) , nausea and jaundice bone metastasis : bone pain , national cancer institute : metastatic cancer : questions and answers so , if a tissue sample taken from a tumor in the lung contains cells that look like breast cells , the doctor determines that the lung tumor is a secondary tumor to do so , malignant cells break away from the primary tumor and attach to and degrade proteins that make up the surrounding extracellular matrix ( ecm ) , which separates the tumor from adjoining tissues although metastasis is widely accepted to be the result of the tumor cells migration , there is a hypothesis saying that some metastases are the result of inflammatory processes by abnormal immune cells still , the determination of the primary tumor can often be very difficult , and the pathologist may have to use several adjuvant techniques , such as immunohistochemistry , fish ( fluorescent in situ hybridization ) , and others once the cancerous tissue is examined under a microscope to determine the cell type , a doctor can usually tell whether that type of cell is normally found in the part of the body from which the tissue sample was taken the body resists metastasis by a variety of mechanisms through the actions of a class of proteins known as metastasis suppressors , of which about a dozen are known currently , three main theories have been proposed to explain the metastatic pathway of cancer : the epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( emt ) and mesenchymal-epithelial transition ( met ) hypothesis ( 1 ) , the cancer stem cell hypothesis ( 2 ) , and the macrophage–cancer cell fusion hybrid hypothesis ( 3 ) the location of the metastases is not always random , with different types of cancer tending to spread to particular organs and tissues at a rate that is higher than expected by statistical chance alone according to the '' seed and soil '' theory , it is difficult for cancer cells to survive outside their region of origin , so in order to metastasize they must find a location with similar characteristics in aggressive cancer cells , loose dna fragments from unstable chromosomes spill in the cytosol leading to the chronic activation of innate immune pathways , which are hijacked by cancer cells to spread to distant organs this hypothesis has been recently utilized to suggest several hypotheses about the life cycle of circulating tumor cells ( ctcs ) and to postulate that the patterns of spread could be better understood through a 'filter and flow ' perspective specifically , exosome vesicles secreted by tumours have been shown to home to pre-metastatic sites , where they activate pro-metastatic processes such as angiogenesis and modify the immune contexture , so as to foster a favourable microenvironment for secondary tumour growth lymphatic spread allows the transport of tumor cells to regional lymph nodes near the primary tumor and ultimately , to other parts of the body for instance , breast cancer cells look the same whether they are found in the breast or have spread to another part of the body treatment and survival is determined , to a great extent , by whether or not a cancer remains localized or spreads to other locations in the body for example , breast tumor cells , which gather calcium ions from breast milk , metastasize to bone tissue , where they can gather calcium ions from bone this is typical route of metastasis for sarcomas , but it is also the favored route for certain types of carcinoma , such as renal cell carcinoma originating in the kidney however , often it remains unclear whether simultaneously diagnosed tumors of a canalicular system are one metastatic process or in fact independent tumors caused by the same agent ( field cancerization ) studies have shown that , if simple questioning does not reveal the cancer 's source ( coughing up blood— '' probably lung '' , urinating blood— '' probably bladder '' ) , complex imaging will not either
