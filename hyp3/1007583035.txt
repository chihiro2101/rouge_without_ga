nicknamed l'avvocato ( '' the lawyer '' ) because he had a degree in law ( though he was never admitted to the order of lawyers ) , agnelli was the most important figure in italian economy , the symbol of capitalism throughout the second half of 20th century , and regarded by many as the true '' king of italy '' the social conflicts related to fiat 's policies ( some say politics ) always saw agnelli keeping the leading role ; in the 1980s , during the last important trade union action , a dramatic situation in which a strike was blocking all of fiat 's production , he was able to organise the march of 40,000 workers who broke the pickets and re-entered the factories gianni – as he was known to differentiate from his grandfather , with whom he shared his first name – inherited the command of fiat and the agnelli family assets in general in 1966 , following a period in which fiat was temporarily '' ruled '' by vittorio valletta while gianni was learning how his family 's company worked giovanni alberto agnelli , the son of gianni 's younger brother , umberto agnelli , died of a rare form of cancer in 1997 at age 33 while he was being groomed by his uncle to head the fiat group his father was the prominent italian industrialist edoardo agnelli and his mother was princess virginia bourbon del monte , daughter of carlo , 4th prince of san faustino , head of a noble family established in perugia he opened factories in many places , including russia ( at the time the soviet union ) and south america , and started international alliances and joint-ventures ( like iveco ) , which marked a new industrial mentality though agnelli continued to be involved with other women during his marriage , including the film star anita ekberg and the american fashion designer jackie rogers , the agnellis remained married until his death of prostate cancer in 2003 at the age of 81 a cultivated man of keen intelligence and a peculiar sense of humour , he was perhaps the most famous italian abroad , forming deep relationships with international bankers and politicians , largely through the bilderberg group , whose conferences he attended regularly since 1958 john elkann , the son of gianni and marella 's daughter , margherita , was expected to take over fiat after gianni 's death another longtime associate was david rockefeller ( yet another bilderberg regular ) , who appointed him to the international advisory committee ( iac ) of chase manhattan bank , of which rockefeller was chairman ; agnelli sat on this committee for thirty years he was known for wearing his wristwatch over his cuff and was regarded as conveying sprezzatura , the italian art of making the difficult look easy in the 1970s , during the international petrol crisis , he sold part of the company to lafico , a libyan company owned by colonel qaddhafi ; agnelli would later repurchase these shares , however agnelli was also closely connected with juventus , the most renowned italian football club , of which he was a fan and the direct owner gianni gave up trying to groom him to take over fiat , seeing how the boy was more interested in mysticism than making cars ( he studied religion at princeton university and took part in a world day of prayer in assisi )
