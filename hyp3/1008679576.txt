the canal company also developed large complexes of sidings along the route , built to service freight to and from the canal 's docks and nearby industrial estates , especially at : salford docks ; trafford park ; partington north coaling basin ( both sides of the canal ) ; glazebrook sidings ; and a small but busy marshalling yard east of irlam locks previously , only roach and sticklebacks could be found in the canal 's upper levels , and then only during the colder parts of the year , but an oxygenation project implemented at salford quays from 2001 , together with the gradual reduction of industrial pollutants from the mersey 's tributaries , has encouraged the migration into the canal of fish populations from further upstream the third was to the south , operated by the cheshire lines committee ( clc ) , whereby the msc railway had taken over the old and abandoned route of the clc , giving them a monopoly on traffic to the new soap works and steel mill during construction , a year after the death of walker , the directors of the canal company and walker 's trustees came to an agreement for the canal company to take ownership of the construction assets traffic reduction was added to by the 1969 closure of the cws irlam soap works ; post nationalisation british steel corporation building their own line to glazebrook to junction with br ; and severe reductions in traffic of ici 's soda ash trains , british tar products and reduced domestic coal consumption at the end of construction , the canal company left in place the original construction railway route , and eventually developed track along of the canal 's length , mainly to its north bank the through-line was officially closed to all traffic in 1978 , but many of the sidings complexes remained ; the last operational section of the msc railway , at trafford park , closed on 30 april 2009 works at partington ( both of which had their own private railways and locomotives ) , with the msc railway 's deviation route pushed south to run alongside the canal 's north bank and under the irlam viaduct episodic pollution and a lack of habitat remain problems for wildlife , although in 2005 , for the first time in living memory , salmon were observed breeding in the river goyt ( a part of the mersey 's catchment ) the water was anoxic waters , which in the latter half of the 20th century often resulted in toxic sediments normally present at the bottom of the turning basin in what is now salford quays rising to the surface during the summer months , giving the impression of solid ground a long term user of hudswell clarke , from their steam through to diesel locomotives , like many industrial railways later motive power was often provided by the purchase of refurbished former '' big-four '' operated types , with the advantage that crew were readily available to operate them however , as transshipment costs increased , and unprocessed bulk cargoes decreased in volume , the economics of road transport resulted in a gradual dwindling of traffic on the msc railway system , and hence contraction in the msc railway itself
