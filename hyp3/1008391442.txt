in the revision known as the post-vulgate cycle , and consequently in thomas malory 's english compilation le morte d'arthur ( the death of arthur ) , arthur is told prophecy by merlin about a just-born child that is to be his undoing , and so he tries to avert the fate by ordering the killing of all the may day newborns the earliest surviving mention of mordred ( referred to as medraut ) is found in an entry for the year 537 in the chronicle annales cambriae ( the annals of wales ) , which references his name in an association with the battle of camlann this episode ( reminiscent of the biblical massacre of the innocents and sometimes dubbed the '' may day massacre '' ) leads to a war between arthur and the furious king lot , believing he was mordred 's father , in which the latter king dies at the hands of arthur 's vassal king pellinore the 14th-century scottish chronicler john of fordun claimed that mordred was the rightful heir to the throne of britain , as arthur was an illegitimate child ( in his account , mordred was the legitimate son of lot and anna , who here is uther 's sister ) in early literature derived from geoffrey 's historia , mordred was considered the legitimate son of arthur 's sister or half-sister queen variably known as morgause with her husband , king lot , the king of either lothian or orkney according to boece , arthur agreed to make mordred his heir but then , on the advice of the britons who did not want mordred to rule , he made constantine his heir ; this led to the war in which arthur and mordred die malory 's telling is a variant of the original account from the vulgate mort artu , in which arthur and mordred both charge at each other on horses three times until arthur drives his lance through mordred 's body , but then fully withdraws it ( a ray of sunlight even shines through the hole ) before mordred 's sword powerfully strikes his head and they both fall from their saddles in another , he is described as the author of one of the '' three unrestrained ravagings of the isle of britain '' – he came to arthur 's court at kelliwic in cornwall , devoured all of the food and drink , and even dragged gwenhwyfar ( guinevere ) from her throne and beat her in geoffrey 's influential historia regum britanniae ( the history of the kings of britain ) , written around 1136 , modredus ( mordred ) is portrayed as the nephew of and traitor to king arthur he has been portrayed by leonard penn ( the adventures of sir galahad 1949 ) , brian worth ( the adventures of sir lancelot 1956–1957 ) , david hemmings ( camelot 1967 ) , robert addie ( excalibur 1981 ) , nickolas grace ( morte d'arthur 1984 ) , simon templeman ( the legend of prince valiant 1991–1994 ) , craig sheffer ( merlin : the return 2000 ) , hans matheson ( the mists of avalon 2001 ) , alexander vlahos and asa butterfield ( merlin 2008–2012 ) , and miyuki sawashiro ( fate/apocrypha 2017 , fate/grand order ) , among others however , he is known for his lustful habits , including even attempted rapes , as in the post-vulgate queste ( in which he is stopped by king bagdemagus who wounds him ) and in the french romance claris et laris besides him , mordred 's other brothers or half-brothers are agravain , gaheris , and gareth in the later tradition derived from the french romance cycles , beginning with the prose versions of robert de boron 's poems merlin and perceval today , however , he is best known as arthur 's own illegitimate son by morgause in the motif introduced in the vulgate cycle , in which their union happens at the time when neither of them have yet known of their blood relation however , mordred 's later characterisation as the king 's villainous son has a precedent in the figure of amhar , a son of arthur 's known from only two references in henry of huntingdon 's retelling of geoffrey 's historia , mordred is beheaded at camlann in a lone charge against him and his entire host by arthur himself , who suffers many injuries in the process the text adds that '' there was much good in mordred , and as soon as he made himself elevated go the throne , he made himself well beloved by all , '' and so they were '' ready to die to defend his honor '' once arthur returned with his army later , as it had been commanded by the dying arthur , the archbishop of canterbury constructs the tower of the dead tomb memorial , from which bleoberis hangs mordred 's head as a warning against treason and there it then remains for centuries until it is removed by the visiting ganelon this sentiment was elaborated upon by walter bower and by hector boece , who in his historia gentis scotorum goes so far as to say arthur and mordred 's brother gawain were traitors and villains and arthur usurped the throne from mordred the alliterative morte arthure has mordred grievously wound arthur with the sword clarent , stolen for him from arthur by his co-conspirator guinevere , but then arthur slashes off mordred 's sword arm and brutally skewers him up on the sword caliburn ( excalibur ) the name mordred , found as the latinised modredus in geoffrey of monmouth 's historia regum britanniae , comes from old welsh medraut ( comparable to old cornish modred and old breton modrot ) in the vulgate lancelot , mordred is the youngest of the siblings who begins his knightly career as agravain 's squire and the two later conspire together to reveal lancelot 's affair with guinevere even malory , who depicts mordred as a villain , notes that the people rallied to him because , '' with arthur was none other life but war and strife , and with sir mordred was great joy and bliss the latter comes to rescue to the young mordred on multiple occasions in the prose lancelot , such as helping save his life at the castle of the white thorn ( castel de la blanche espine ) , and mordred in turn treats lancelot as his personal hero in the historia and certain other texts , such as the alliterative morte arthure reimagination of the historia where mordred is portrayed sympathetically , mordred marries guinevere consensually after he takes the throne in such modern adaptations , morgause is often conflated with ( and into ) the character of morgan le fay , who may be mordred 's mother or alternatively his lover or wife
