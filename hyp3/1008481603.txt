st was formed in 1987 by the merger of two government-owned semiconductor companies : italian '' sgs microelettronic '' ( where sgs stands for '' società generale semiconduttori '' , '' semiconductors ' general company '' ) , and french '' thomson semiconducteurs '' , the semiconductor arm of thomson : '' sgs microelettronica '' originated in 1972 from a previous merger of two companies : ates ( '' aquila tubi e semiconduttori '' ) , a vacuum tube and semiconductor maker headquartered in l'aquila , the regional capital of abruzzo , which in 1961 changed its name to azienda tecnica ed elettronica del sud and relocated its manufacturing plant in the industrial zone of catania , in sicily ; '' società generale semiconduttori '' ( founded in 1957 by adriano olivetti ) it included : the semiconductor activities of the french electronics company thomson ; in 1985 it bought mostek , a us company founded in 1969 as a spin-off of texas instruments , from united technologies ; silec , founded in 1977 ; eurotechnique , founded in 1979 in rousset , bouches-du-rhône as a joint-venture between saint-gobain of france and us-based national semiconductor ; efcis , founded in 1977 ; sescosem , founded in 1969 the company has participated in the consolidation of the semiconductor industry since its formation , with acquisitions including : in 1989 , british company inmos known for its transputer microprocessors from parent thorn emi ; in 1994 , canada-based nortel 's semiconductor activities ; in 2000 , waferscale integration inc ( wsi , fremont , california ) , a vendor of eprom and flash memory-based programmable system-chips ; in 2002 , alcatel 's microelectronics division , which along with the incorporation of smaller ventures such as uk company , synad ltd , helped the company expand into the wireless-lan market ; in 2007 , us-based genesis microchip semiconductor market consolidation continued with st and nxp announcing on april 10 , 2008 , the creation of a new joint venture of their mobile activities , with st owning 80 % of the new company and nxp 20 % at the time of the merger of these two companies in 1987 , the newborn corporation was named '' sgs-thomson '' but took its current name in may 1998 following thomson ’ s sale of its shares on may 22 , 2007 , st and intel created a joint venture in the memory application called numonyx : this new company merged st and '' intel flash memory '' activities the site 's two major wafer fabs are a fab , opened in april 1997 by then-italian prime minister romano prodi , and a fab that has never been completed and which was transferred in its current state to '' numonyx '' in 2008 calamba city , in the province of laguna , philippines , : in 2008 , st acquired this plant from nxp semiconductors headquartered in geneva , switzerland , it was a fabless company , outsourcing semiconductor manufacturing to foundry companies by 2005 , st was ranked fifth , behind intel , samsung , texas instruments and toshiba , but ahead of infineon , renesas , nec , nxp semiconductors , and freescale shenzhen , guangdong province , china , near hong kong : in 1994 , st and the shenzhen electronics group signed a partnership to construct and jointly operate an assembly plant ( st has majority with 60 % ) as of 2010 , st employed some 1,500 people in kirkop , making it the largest private sector employer , and the country 's leading exporter on february 10 , 2009 , st ericsson , a joint venture bringing together '' st-nxp wireless '' and '' ericsson mobile platforms '' , was established in 1988 , a small group of employees from the thomson rousset plant ( including the director , marc lassus ) founded a start-up company , gemalto ( formerly known as gemplus ) which became a leader in the smartcard industry the phoenix , arizona 8 & nbsp ; inch ( 200 & nbsp ; mm ) fab , the carrollton , texas 6 & nbsp ; inch ( 150 & nbsp ; mm ) fab , and the ain sebaa , morocco fab are beginning rampdown plans , and are destined to close by 2010 all the historical wafer fab lines are now closed but the site hosts the headquarters of many divisions ( marketing , design , industrialization ) and an important r & d center , focused on silicon and software design and fab process development as part of the nationalisation , a former thomson plant in the center of aix-en-provence operating since the 1960s was closed and staff were transferred to the new rousset site the fab , known as crolles 1 , is the company 's first and was built as part of a 1991 partnership between sgs-thomson and philips to develop new manufacturing technologies the crolles site hosts a and a fab and was originally built as a common r & d center for submicrometre technologies as part of the 1990 grenoble 92 partnership between sgs-thomson and cnet , the r & d center of french telecom company france telecom stmicroelectronics is , as of 2008 , the largest private employer on the island , employing around 1,800 people this alliance of stmicroelectronics , tsmc , nxp semiconductors ( formerly philips semiconductor ) and freescale ( formerly motorola semiconductor ) partnered in 2002 to develop the facility and to work together on process development the site opened in 1979 as a fab operated by eurotechnique , a joint venture between saint-gobain of france and national semiconductor of the us ang mo kio , singapore : in 1970 , sgs created its first assembly back-end plant in singapore , in the area of toa payoh on july 10 , 2007 , st said that it would close this site , and in july 2010 the shell of the phoenix pf1 fab was bought by western digital corporation sgs 's first presence in the us was a sales office based in phoenix in the early 1980s '' st ericsson '' was a multinational manufacturer of wireless products and semiconductors , supplying to mobile device manufacturers early in 2007 , '' nxp semiconductors '' ( formerly '' philips semiconductors '' ) and '' freescale '' ( formerly '' motorola semiconductors '' ) decided to stop their participation in crolles 2 alliance owner thomson sa sold its stake in the company in 1998 when the company also listed on the italian bourse in milan as of december 31 , 2014 , the shareholders were : 68.4 % public ( new york stock exchange , euronext paris , borsa italiana ) 4.1 % treasury shares 27.6 % stmicroelectronics holding b.v the fab was closed in 2000 , however , a design , r & d centre and sales office is operating in the city ottawa , canada : in 1993 , sgs-thomson purchased the semiconductor activities of nortel which owned in ottawa an r & d center and a fab
