the services provided by the data link layer are : encapsulation of network layer data packets into frames frame synchronization in the logical link control ( llc ) sublayer : error control ( automatic repeat request , arq ) , in addition to arq provided by some transport-layer protocols , to forward error correction ( fec ) techniques provided on the physical layer , and to error-detection and packet canceling provided at all layers , including the network layer in some networks , such as ieee 802 local area networks , the data link layer is described in more detail with media access control ( mac ) and logical link control ( llc ) sublayers ; this means that the ieee 802.2 llc protocol can be used with all of the ieee 802 mac layers , such as ethernet , token ring , ieee 802.11 , etc in the itu-t g.hn standard , which provides a way to create a high-speed ( up to 1 gigabit/s ) local area network using existing home wiring ( power lines , phone lines and coaxial cables ) , the data link layer is divided into three sub-layers ( application protocol convergence , logical link control and media access control ) the tcp/ip link layer has the operating scope of the link a host is connected to , and only concerns itself with hardware issues to the point of obtaining hardware ( mac ) addresses for locating hosts on the link and transmitting data frames onto the link within the semantics of the osi network architecture , the protocols of the data link layer respond to service requests from the network layer , and perform their function by issuing service requests to the physical layer it was formulated for the purpose of illustrating the logical groups and scopes of functions needed in the design of the suite of internetworking protocols of tcp/ip , as needed for the operation of the internet arcnet atm cisco discovery protocol ( cdp ) controller area network ( can ) econet ethernet ethernet automatic protection switching ( eaps ) fiber distributed data interface ( fddi ) frame relay high-level data link control ( hdlc ) ieee 802.2 ( provides llc functions to ieee 802 mac layers ) ieee 802.11 wireless lan iÂ²c lattisnet link layer discovery protocol ( lldp ) localtalk mil-std-1553 multiprotocol label switching ( mpls ) nortel discovery protocol ( ndp ) point-to-point protocol ( ppp ) profibus spacewire serial line internet protocol ( slip ) ( obsolete ) split multi-link trunking ( smlt ) ieee 802.1aq - shortest path bridging spanning tree protocol starlan token ring udld ( udld ) uni/o 1-wire and most forms of serial communication in the internet protocol suite ( tcp/ip ) , osi 's data link layer functionality is contained within its lowest layer , the link layer in contrast to the hierarchical and routable addresses of the network layer , layer 2 addresses are flat , meaning that no part of the address can be used to identify the logical or physical group to which the address belongs in the medium access control ( mac ) sublayer : multiple access methods for channel-access control , for example csma/cd protocols for collision detection and re-transmission in ethernet bus networks and hub networks , or the csma/ca protocol for collision avoidance in wireless networks that transfer can be reliable or unreliable ; many data link protocols do not have acknowledgments of successful frame reception and acceptance , and some data link protocols might not even perform any check for transmission errors in general , direct or strict comparisons of the osi and tcp/ip models should be avoided , because the layering in tcp/ip is not a principal design criterion and in general , considered to be '' harmful '' ( rfc 3439 ) other data-link-layer protocols , such as hdlc , are specified to include both sublayers , although some other protocols , such as cisco hdlc , use hdlc 's low-level framing as a mac layer in combination with a different llc layer the receiver knows that the last number received is the error-detecting metadata and that all data before is the message , so the receiver can recalculate the above math and if the metadata matches it can be concluded that the data has been received error-free
