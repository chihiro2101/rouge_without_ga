christian was born at frederiksborg castle in denmark on 12 april 1577 as the third child and eldest son of king frederick ii of denmark–norway and sofie of mecklenburg-schwerin he was descended , through his mother 's side , from king john of denmark , and was thus the first descendant of king john to assume the crown since the deposition of king christian ii at the time , denmark was still an elective monarchy , so in spite of being the eldest son christian was not automatically heir to the throne curtailment of the monarch 's power , a danish parallel to the magna carta ) , which was an identical copy of his father 's from 1559 twelve days later , on 29 august 1596 , christian iv was crowned at the church of our lady in copenhagen by the bishop of zealand , peder jensen vinstrup ( 1549–1614 ) the danish navy , which in 1596 had consisted of but twenty-two vessels , in 1610 rose to sixty , some of them built after christian 's own designs the visit was generally judged to be a success , although the heavy drinking indulged in by english and danes alike caused some unfavourable comments : both christian and james had an ability to consume great amounts of alcohol , while remaining lucid , which most of their courtiers did not share the entertainment which was intended to crown the visit , a masque of solomon and the queen of sheba at theobalds house , was described by sir john harington as a drunken fiasco , where most of the players simply fell over from the effects of too much wine review of development and change 14 ( 1 & 2 ) : 19–40 but instead the nayak of tanjore ( now thanjavur in tamil nadu ) turned out to be interested in trading opportunities and a treaty was negotiated granting the danes the village of tranquebar ( or tarangamabadi ) on india 's south coast and the right to construct a '' stone house '' ( fort dansborg ) and levy taxes here , his objectives were twofold : first , to obtain control of the great german rivers— the elbe and the weser— & nbsp ; as a means of securing his dominion of the northern seas ; and secondly , to acquire the secularised german archdiocese of bremen and prince-bishopric of verden as appanages for his younger sons he skillfully took advantage of the alarm of the german protestants after the battle of white mountain in 1620 , to secure co-adjutorship of the see of bremen for his son frederick ( september 1621 ) christian iv had obtained for his kingdom a level of stability and wealth that was virtually unmatched elsewhere in europe lockhart , denmark , 1513–1660 : the rise and decline of a renaissance monarchy ( oxford university press , 2007 ) & nbsp ; 400–433 denmark 's intervention in the thirty years ' war was aided by france and by charles i of england , who agreed to help subsidise the war partly because christian was the uncle of both the stuart king and his sister elizabeth of bohemia through their mother , anne of denmark thus christian , as war-leader of the lower saxon circle , entered the war with an army of only 20,000 mercenaries , some of his allies from britain and a national army 15,000 strong , leading them as duke of holstein rather than as king of denmark despite the growing power of roman catholics in north germany , and the threat to the danish holdings in the schleswig-holstein duchies , christian for a time stayed his hand he had at his disposal from 19,000 to 25,000 men , and at first gained some successes but on 27 august 1626 he was routed by johan tzerclaes , count of tilly in the battle of lutter thus with the help of sweden , the superior sea-power enabled denmark to tide over her worst difficulties , and in may 1629 christian was able to conclude peace with the emperor in the treaty of lübeck , without any diminution of territory however , the treaty bound christian not to interfere in the thirty years ' war any further , removing any danish obstacles when gustavus adolphus entered the war in 1630 to compensate for lacking export revenues , and also in order to stifle the swedish advances in the thirty years ' war , christian enacted a number of increases in the sound dues throughout the 1630s christian gained both in popularity and influence at home , and he hoped to increase his external power still further with the assistance of his sons-in-law , corfitz ulfeldt and hannibal sehested , who now came prominently forward his scandinavian policy was so irritating and vexatious that swedish statesmen advocated for a war with denmark , to keep christian from interfering in the peace negotiations with the holy roman emperor , and in may 1643 , christian faced another war against sweden sweden was able , thanks to their conquests in the thirty years ' war , to attack denmark from the south as well as the east ; the dutch alliance promised to secure them at sea in may 1643 the swedish privy council decided upon war ; on 12 december the swedish field marshal lennart torstensson , advancing from bohemia , crossed the southern frontier of denmark ; and by the end of january 1644 the whole peninsula of jutland was in swedish hands as christian stood on the quarter-deck of the trinity a cannon close by was exploded by a swedish cannonball , and splinters of wood and metal wounded the king in thirteen places , blinding one eye and flinging him to the deck but the swedish fleet escaped , and the annihilation of the danish fleet by the combined navies of sweden and the netherlands , after an obstinate fight between fehmarn and lolland at the end of september , exhausted the military resources of denmark and compelled christian to accept the mediation of france and the netherlands ; and peace was finally signed with the treaty of brömsebro on 8 february 1645 here denmark had to cede gotland , ösel and ( for thirty years ) halland , while norway lost the two provinces jämtland and härjedalen , giving sweden the supremacy of the baltic sea he also restored and restructured the castle akershus , where he invited the people of norway to the official and age-old installment of the king in 1590 , and again in 1610 when the king was busy overseeing the reparations and re-building of the fortress at oslo , he lived in the country all summer , and at the same time tried to establish a centre for producing iron at eiker , buskerud during the fourteenth century the swedish kings tried to push the areas of their control towards the north , and contemporary maps depicted the now norwegian coastal areas of troms and finnmark as a part of sweden he was responsible for several witch burnings , including 21 people in iceland , and most notably the conviction and execution of maren spliid , who was victim of a witch hunt at ribe and was burned at the gallows hill near ribe on 9 november 1641 on 21 february 1648 , at his earnest request , he was carried in a litter from frederiksborg to his beloved copenhagen , where he died a week later dowland accompanied the king on his tours , and as he was employed in 1603 , rumour has it he was in norway as well christian iv is renowned for his many city ( town ) foundations , and is most likely the nordic head of state that can be accredited for the highest number of new cities in his realm a short-lived town was : christianspris , now in schleswig , germany , founded as a garrison town near kiel in the then danish territory of holstein furthermore , christian is known for erecting many important buildings in his realm , including the observatory rundetårn , the stock exchange børsen , the copenhagen fortress kastellet , rosenborg castle , workers ' district nyboder , the copenhagen naval holmen church ( holmens kirke ) , proviantgården , a brewery , the tøjhus museum arsenal , and two trinity churches in copenhagen and modern kristianstad , now known as respectively trinitatis church and holy trinity church when christian was crowned king , denmark-norway held a supremacy over the baltic sea , which was lost to sweden during the years of his reign nevertheless , christian was one of the few kings from the house of oldenburg that achieved a lasting legacy of popularity with both the danish and norwegian people christian iv also features prominently in the novel music and silence by rose tremain , which is primarily set in and around the danish court in the years 1629 and 1630 christian iv is depicted as a foul-natured person , but a good king who did a lot to make his realm flourish , by the danish alternative music band mew in their song , '' king christian '' in 1632 an english envoy to king christian iv , then aged 55 , primly remarked : '' such is the life of that king : to drink all day and to lie with a whore every night '' with his second wife , kirsten munk , he had 12 children , though the youngest , dorothea elisabeth , was rumoured to be the daughter of kirsten 's lover , otto ludwig : stillborn child ( b file : christian iv av cl jacobsen 2.jpg statue of king christian iv in oslo file : kr-iv-ks ubt.jpeg statue of christian iv in kristiansand file : nyboder 2005-03.jpg statue of christian iv in copenhagen file : frederiksborg slot - interior 20090818 03.jpg bust of christian iv at frederiksborg castle file : kong christian den fjerde i roskilde domkirke.jpg sculpture by christian iv in roskilde cathedral by bertel thorvaldsen file : chr iv rådhuset kristianstad.jpg statue of christian iv at the city hall in kristianstad by bertel thorvaldsen file : kungamöte-2.jpg sculpture of christian iv meeting the king of sweden , gustav ii adolf in halmstad in the 1621 treaty of the hague and treaty of bremen between denmark and the dutch republic , christian was styled '' lord christian the fourth , king of all denmark and norway , the goths and the wends , duke of schleswig , holstein , stormarn , and ditmarsh , count of oldenburg and delmenhorst , etc
