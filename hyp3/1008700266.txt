examples of digital channel models are : binary symmetric channel ( bsc ) , a discrete memoryless channel with a certain bit error probability binary error burst channel model , a channel '' with memory '' binary erasure channel ( bec ) , a discrete channel with a certain bit error detection ( erasure ) probability packet erasure channel , where packets are lost with a certain packet loss probability or packet error rate arbitrarily varying channel ( avc ) , where the behavior and state of the channel can change randomly z-channel ( information theory ) ( binary asymmetric channel ) , where each 0 bit is transmitted correctly , but each 1 bit has probability p of being transmitted incorrectly as a 0 the model may reflect the following channel impairments : noise model , for example additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channel , a linear continuous memoryless model phase noise model interference model , for example crosstalk ( co-channel interference ) and intersymbol interference ( isi ) distortion model , for example a non-linear channel model causing intermodulation distortion ( imd ) frequency response model , including attenuation and phase-shift group delay model modelling of underlying physical layer transmission techniques , for example a complex-valued equivalent baseband model of modulation and frequency response radio frequency propagation model , for example log-distance path loss model fading model , for example rayleigh fading , ricean fading , log-normal shadow fading and frequency selective ( dispersive ) fading doppler shift model , which combined with fading results in a time-variant system ray tracing models , which attempt to model the signal propagation and distortions for specified transmitter-receiver geometries , terrain types , and antennas mobility models , which also causes a time-variant system these are examples of commonly used channel capacity and performance measures : spectral bandwidth in hertz symbol rate in baud , pulses/s or symbols/s digital bandwidth bit/s measures : gross bit rate ( signalling rate ) , net bit rate ( information rate ) , channel capacity , and maximum throughput channel utilization link spectral efficiency signal-to-noise ratio measures : signal-to-interference ratio , eb/no , carrier-to-interference ratio in decibel bit-error rate ( ber ) , packet-error rate ( per ) latency in seconds : propagation time , transmission time delay jitter digital ( discrete ) or analog ( continuous ) channel transmission medium , for example a fibre channel multiplexing computer network virtual channel simplex communication , duplex communication or half duplex communication channel return channel uplink or downlink ( upstream or downstream channel ) broadcast channel , unicast or multicast the model can be a linear or non-linear , time-continuous or time-discrete ( sampled ) , memoryless or dynamic ( resulting in burst errors ) , time-invariant or time-variant ( also resulting in burst errors ) , baseband , passband ( rf signal model ) , real-valued or complex-valued signal model the following channels are the principal multi-terminal channels which was first introduced in the field of information theory : a point-to-multipoint channel , also known as broadcasting medium ( not to be confused with broadcasting channel ) : in this channel , a single sender transmits multiple messages to different destination nodes a storage which can communicate a message over time as well as space the portion of a storage medium , such as a track or band , that is accessible to a given reading or writing station or head statistically , a communication channel is usually modelled as a triple consisting of an input alphabet , an output alphabet , and for each pair ( i , o ) of input and output elements a transition probability p ( i , o ) relay channel : in this channel , one or several intermediate nodes ( called relay , repeater or gap filler nodes ) cooperate with a sender to send the message to an ultimate destination node since 2006 television broadcasting has switched to digital modulation ( digital television ) which uses image compression to transmit a television signal in a much smaller bandwidth , so each of these '' physical channels '' has been divided into multiple '' virtual channels '' each carrying a dtv channel multiple access channel : in this channel , multiple senders transmit multiple possible different messages over a shared physical medium to one or several destination nodes a single path provided by a transmission medium via either physical separation , such as by multipair cable or electrical separation , such as by frequency-division or time-division multiplexing a specific radio frequency , pair or band of frequencies , usually named with a letter , number , or codeword , and often allocated by international agreement for example , in wireless communications the channel is often modelled by a random attenuation ( known as fading ) of the transmitted signal , followed by additive noise : see also network topology in networks , as opposed to point-to-point communication , the communication media is shared between multiple nodes ( terminals )
