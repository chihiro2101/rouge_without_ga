further , the high costs of photomask and other manufacturing prerequisites make it essential to design the circuit to be as close to perfect as possible before the integrated circuit is first built in these cases it is common to use spice to perform monte carlo simulations of the effect of component variations on performance , a task which is impractical using calculations by hand for a circuit of any appreciable complexity circuit simulation programs , of which spice and derivatives are the most prominent , take a text netlist describing the circuit elements ( transistors , resistors , capacitors , etc spice was developed at the electronics research laboratory of the university of california , berkeley by laurence nagel with direction from his research advisor , prof cancer is an acronym for '' computer analysis of nonlinear circuits , excluding radiation '' , a hint to berkeley 's liberalism in the 1960s : life of spice at these times many circuit simulators were developed under contracts with the united states department of defense that required the capability to evaluate the radiation hardness of a circuit spice2 , also coded in fortran , is a much-improved program with more circuit elements , variable timestep transient analysis using either the trapezoidal ( second order adams-moulton method ) or the gear integration method ( also known as bdf ) , equation formulation via modified nodal analysis ( avoiding the limitations of nodal analysis ) , and an innovative fortran-based memory allocation system developed by another graduate student , ellis cohen when rohrer left berkeley , cancer was re-written and re-named to spice , released as version 1 to the public domain in may of 1972 instrumental in the decision to release spice as a public-domain computer program was professor donald pederson of berkeley , who believed that all significant technical progress happens when information is freely shared the birth of spice was named an ieee milestone in 2011 ; the entry mentions that spice '' evolved to become the worldwide standard integrated circuit simulator '' 871-874 , 10–13 may 1992 developed at georgia tech , which added mixed analog/digital '' code models '' for behavioral simulation ; cider codecs : a mixed-level circuit and device simulator , k ucb/erl m88/71 , berkeley , 1988 , ( previously codecs ) , developed by uc berkeley and oregon state university , which added semiconductor device modeling ; spice opus , developed and maintained by the university of ljubljana based on spice 3f.4 and on xspice ; and ngspice , based on spice 3f.5 , xspice and cider berkeley spice inspired and served as a basis for many other circuit simulation programs , in academia , in industry , and in commercial products spice became popular because it contained the analyses and models needed to design integrated circuits of the time , and was robust enough and fast enough to be practical to use , is it time for spice4 ? , 2004 numerical aspects of device and circuit modeling workshop , june 23–25 , 2004 , santa fe , new mexico retrieved on 2007-11-10 precursors to spice often had a single purpose : the bias program , for example , did simulation of bipolar transistor circuit operating points ; the slic program did only small-signal analyses spice combined operating point solutions , transient analysis , and various small-signal analyses with the circuit elements and device models needed to successfully simulate many circuits spice2 includes these analyses : ac analysis ( linear small-signal frequency domain analysis ) dc analysis ( nonlinear quiescent point calculation ) dc transfer curve analysis ( a sequence of nonlinear operating points calculated while sweeping an input voltage or current , or a circuit parameter ) noise analysis ( a small signal analysis done using an adjoint matrix technique which sums uncorrelated noise currents at a chosen output point ) transfer function analysis ( a small-signal input/output gain and impedance calculation ) transient analysis ( time-domain large-signal solution of nonlinear differential algebraic equations ) since spice is generally used to model nonlinear circuits , the small signal analyses are necessarily preceded by a quiescent point calculation at which the circuit is linearized however , a public-domain circuit simulator containing the modern analyses and features needed to become a successor in popularity to spice has not yet emerged spice2 includes many semiconductor device compact models : three levels of mosfet model , a combined ebers–moll and gummel–poon model , a jfet model , and a model for a diode in addition , it had many other elements : resistors , capacitors , inductors ( including coupling ) , independent voltage and current sources , ideal transmission lines , active components and voltage and current controlled sources to attempt standardization of these models so that a set of model parameters may be used in different simulators , an industry working group was formed , the compact model council , to choose , maintain and promote the use of standard models traditional photonic device simulators apply direct methods to solve maxwell 's equations for the complete structure , whereas photonic circuit simulators are based on a segmentation into logic block ( bbs ) , each of which is represented at a logic level by a photonic device , '' coupled to other bbs by guided modes of optical waveguides '' the building block netlist of both the photonic and electronic circuits , including their net and port connections , can be expressed in a spice format with some schematic editors , like the ones used for electronic design automation to make the amount of information tractable , the modulation increases of complexity , having to encode both amplitude and phase , in a way similar as in the simulation of rf circuits however , photonic integrated circuit simulators need to test multiple communication channels in match with different carrier frequencies , or equivalently more amplitudes in any single channel , a type of sophisticated signal that is unsupported on the program features and structure as described above at 2019 , spice can not be used to '' simulate photonics and electronics together in a photonic circuit simulator '' , and thus it is not yet considered as a test simulator for photonic integrated circuits
