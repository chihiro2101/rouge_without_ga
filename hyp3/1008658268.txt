the liquid is also colorless but can appear as a brownish yellow liquid due to the presence of no 2 according to the following equilibrium : : n 2 o 4 ⇌ 2 no 2 higher temperatures push the equilibrium towards nitrogen dioxide nitrogen tetroxide is made by the catalytic oxidation of ammonia : steam is used as a diluent to reduce the combustion temperature in the first step , the ammonia is oxidized into nitric oxide : : 4 nh 3 + 5 o 2 → 4 no + 6 h 2 o most of the water is condensed out , and the gases are further cooled ; the nitric oxide that was produced is oxidized to nitrogen dioxide , which is then dimerized into nitrogen tetroxide : : 2 no + o 2 → 2 no 2 : 2 no 2 ⇌ n 2 o 4 and the remainder of the water is removed as nitric acid the gas is essentially pure nitrogen dioxide , which is condensed into dinitrogen tetroxide in a brine-cooled liquefier nitrogen tetroxide is used as an oxidizer in one of the most important rocket propellants because it can be stored as a liquid at room temperature in early 1944 , research on the usability of dinitrogen tetroxide as an oxidizing agent for rocket fuel was conducted by german scientists , although the germans only used it to a very limited extent as an additive for s-stoff ( fuming nitric acid ) when used as a propellant , dinitrogen tetroxide is usually referred to simply as nitrogen tetroxide and the abbreviation nto is extensively used additionally , nto is often used with the addition of a small percentage of nitric oxide , which inhibits stress-corrosion cracking of titanium alloys , and in this form , propellant-grade nto is referred to as mixed oxides of nitrogen ( mon ) this hot nitrogen dioxide is expanded through a turbine , cooling it and lowering the pressure , and then cooled further in a heat sink , causing it to recombine into nitrogen tetroxide at the original molecular weight when exposed to oxygen , no is converted back into nitrogen dioxide : : 2 no + o 2 → 2 no 2 the resulting no 2 and n 2 o 4 can be returned to the cycle to give the mixture of nitrous and nitric acids again n 2 o 4 behaves as the salt no + no 3 − , the former being a strong oxidant : : 2 n 2 o 4 + m → 2 no + m ( no 3 ) 2 where m cu , zn , or sn
