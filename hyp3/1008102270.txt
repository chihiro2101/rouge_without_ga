'' in contrast to the relative dearth of reports on frozen ground in north america prior to world war ii , a vast literature on the engineering aspects of permafrost was available in russian life can be supported only within the active layer since growth and root establishment can occur only in soil that is fully thawed for some part of the year while a recent study that includes stores of the tibetan plateau , estimates total carbon pools in the permafrost of the northern hemisphere to be 1832 gt note the importance of the vertical 0° c line : it denotes the bottom of the active layer in the seasonally variable temperature zone and the bottom limit of permafrost as the temperature increases with depth -- - > permafrost is soil , rock or sediment that is frozen for more than two consecutive years in areas not overlain by ice , it exists beneath a layer of soil , rock or sediment , which freezes and thaws annually and is called the '' active layer '' active layer thickness varies with the season , but is 0.3 to 4 meters thick ( shallow along the arctic coast ; deep in southern siberia and the qinghai-tibetan plateau ) the extent of permafrost varies with the climate : in the northern hemisphere today , 24 % of the ice-free land area , equivalent to 19 & nbsp ; million square kilometers , is more or less influenced by permafrost alan , brown , jerry ; humlum , ole and svensson , harald ; ‘ state of the earth ’ s cryosphere at the beginning of the 21st century : glaciers , global snow cover , floating ice , and permafrost and periglacial environments ’ , p a435 most of this area is found in siberia , northern canada , alaska and greenland since all glaciers are warmed at their base by geothermal heat , glacier types , which are near the pressure-melting point throughout , may have liquid water at the interface with the ground and are therefore free of underlying permafrost thus , if the mean annual air temperature is only slightly below , permafrost will form only in spots that are sheltered—usually with a northern or southern aspect ( in north and south hemispheres respectively ) —creating discontinuous permafrost discontinuous permafrost is often further divided into extensive discontinuous permafrost , where permafrost covers between 50 and 90 percent of the landscape and is usually found in areas with mean annual temperatures between , and sporadic permafrost , where permafrost cover is less than 50 percent of the landscape and typically occurs at mean annual temperatures between exceptions occur in un-glaciated siberia and alaska where the present depth of permafrost is a relic of climatic conditions during glacial ages where winters were up to colder than those of today this extended over several glacial and interglacial cycles of the pleistocene and suggests that the present climate of prudhoe bay is probably considerably warmer than it has been on average over that period when the ice content of a permafrost exceeds 250 percent ( ice to dry soil by mass ) it is classified as massive ice , 2009 intrasedimental ice forms by in-place freezing of subterranean waters and is dominated by segregational ice which results from the crystallizational differentiation taking place during the freezing of wet sediments , accompanied by water migrating to the freezing front file : peat plateau complex.jpg thumb a peat plateau complex south of fort simpson , northwest territories file : pingos near tuk.jpg pingos near tuktoyaktuk , northwest territories , canada file : permafrost - polygon.jpg ground polygons file : permafrost stone-rings hg.jpg stone rings on spitsbergen file : ice-wedge hg.jpg ice wedges seen from top file : permafrost soil-flow hg.jpg solifluction on svalbard file : permafrost pattern.jpg contraction crack ( ice wedge ) polygons on arctic sediment the permafrost carbon cycle ( arctic carbon cycle ) deals with the transfer of carbon from permafrost soils to terrestrial vegetation and microbes , to the atmosphere , back to vegetation , and finally back to permafrost soils through burial and sedimentation due to cryogenic processes the consequence is thawing soil , which may be weaker , and release of methane , which contributes to an increased rate of global warming as part of a feedback loop caused by microbial decomposition at the last glacial maximum , continuous permafrost covered a much greater area than it does today , covering all of ice-free europe south to about szeged ( southeastern hungary ) and the sea of azov ( then dry land ) sidorchuk , aleksey , borisova olga and panin ;

alternatively , where structures are built on piles , warming can cause movement through creep because of the change of friction on the piles even as the soil remains frozen the trans-alaska pipeline system uses heat pipe permafrost cooling to prevent the pipeline from sinking and the qingzang railway in tibet employs a variety of methods to keep the ground cool , both in areas with frost-susceptible soil the melnikov permafrost institute in yakutsk , found that the sinking of large buildings into the ground can be prevented by using pile foundations extending down to or more
