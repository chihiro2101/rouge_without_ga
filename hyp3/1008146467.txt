like all islamic peripatetics , ibn rushd admits the hypothesis of the intelligence of the spheres and the hypothesis of universal emanation , through which motion is communicated from place to place to all parts of the universe as far as the supreme world & mdash ; hypotheses which , in the mind of the arabic philosophers , did away with the dualism involved in aristotle 's doctrine of pure energy and eternal matter however , in the western thought , it is generally known that it was a specific area peculiar merely to the great philosophers of islam : al-kindi ( alkindus ) , al-farabi ( alfarabi ) , avicenna ( avicenna ) , ibn bajjah ( avempace ) , averroes ( averroes ) , and ibn khaldun 980-1037 ) , internet encyclopedia of philosophy in the 12th century , ibn tufail further developed the concept of tabula rasa in his arabic novel , hayy ibn yaqzan , in which he depicted the development of the mind of a feral child '' from a tabula rasa to that of an adult , in complete isolation from society '' on a desert island he argued that the '' human intellect at birth is rather like a tabula rasa , a pure potentiality that is actualized through education and comes to know '' and that knowledge is attained through '' empirical familiarity with objects in this world from which one abstracts universal concepts '' which is developed through a '' syllogism method of reasoning ; observations lead to prepositional statements , which when compounded lead to further abstract concepts like the other abrahamic religions , islam teaches the bodily resurrection of the dead , the fulfillment of a divine plan for creation , and the immortality of the human soul ( though jews do not necessarily view the soul as eternal ) ; the righteous are rewarded with the pleasures of jannah ( heaven ) , while the unrighteous are punished in jahannam ( hell ) for saadia there was no problem as to creation : god created the world ex nihilo , just as the bible attests ; and he contests the theory of the mutakallamin in reference to atoms , which theory , he declares , is just as contrary to reason and religion as the theory of the philosophers professing the eternity of matter it became '' one of the most important books that heralded the scientific revolution '' and age of enlightenment , and the thoughts expressed in the novel can be found in '' different variations and to different degrees in the books of thomas hobbes , john locke , isaac newton , and immanuel kant from the 9th century onward , owing to caliph al-ma'mun and his successor , greek philosophy was introduced among the arabs , and the peripatetic school began to find able representatives among them ; such were al-kindi , al-farabi , avicenna , and averroes , all of whose fundamental principles were considered as criticized by the mutakallamin the influence of this reaction brought forth the two greatest philosophers that the islamic peripatetic school ever produced , namely , ibn bajjah ( avempace ) and ibn rushd ( averroes ) , both of whom undertook the defense of philosophy the philosophers maimonides ( a jew born in al andalus ) and ibn khaldun ( born in modern-day tunisia ) , the father of sociology and historiography , were also important philosophers , though the latter did not identify himself as a falsafa , but rather a kalam author with kalam , questions about the sira and hadith , as well as science ( islamic science ) and law ( fiqh and sharia ) , began to be investigated beyond the scope of muhammad 's beliefs ibn al-nafis described his book theologus autodidactus as a defense of '' the system of islam and the muslims ' doctrines on the missions of prophets , the religious laws , the resurrection of the body , and the transitoriness of the world the mutazilities , compelled to defend their principles against the orthodox islam of their day , looked for support in philosophy , and are one of the first to pursue a rational theology called ilm-al-kalam ( scholasticism ) ; those professing it were called mutakallamin it can be argued that the attacks directed against the philosophers by al-ghazali in his work , tahafut al-falasifa ( the incoherence of the philosophers ) , not only produced , by reaction , a current favorable to philosophy , but induced the philosophers themselves to profit by his criticism 74 ) , and employs the following one of their premises to justify his position : '' only a substance can be the substratum of an accident '' ( that is , of a non-essential property of things ) the concept of '' existence precedes essence '' , a key foundational concept of existentialism , can also be found in the works of averroes , as a reaction to avicenna 's concept of '' essence precedes existence '' early islamic political philosophy emphasized an inexorable link between science and religion , and the process of ijtihad to find truth - in effect all philosophy was '' political '' as it had real implications for governance for example , the ideas of the khawarij in the very early years of muslim history on khilafa and ummah , or that of shia islam on the concept of imamah are considered proofs of political thought philosophus autodidactus also developed the themes of empiricism , tabula rasa , nature versus nurture , condition of possibility , materialism , dominique urvoy , '' the rationality of everyday life : the andalusian tradition ?
