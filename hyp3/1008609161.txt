stress builds up when a fault is locked , and when it reaches a level that exceeds the strength threshold , the fault ruptures and the accumulated strain energy is released in part as seismic waves , forming an earthquake strain occurs accumulatively or instantaneously , depending on the rheology of the rock ; the ductile lower crust and mantle accumulate deformation gradually via shearing , whereas the brittle upper crust reacts by fracture – instantaneous stress release – resulting in motion along the fault a fault 's sense of slip is defined as the relative motion of the rock on each side of the fault concerning the other side . in measuring the horizontal or vertical separation , the throw of the fault is the vertical component of the separation and the heave of the fault is the horizontal component , as in '' throw up and heave out '' the vector of slip can be qualitatively assessed by studying any drag folding of strata , which may be visible on either side of the fault ; the direction and magnitude of heave and throw can be measured only by finding common intersection points on either side of the fault ( called a piercing point ) based on the direction of slip , faults can be categorized as : strike-slip , where the offset is predominantly horizontal , parallel to the fault trace ; dip-slip , offset is predominantly vertical and/or perpendicular to the fault trace ; or oblique-slip , combining strike and dip slip in a strike-slip fault ( also known as a wrench fault , tear fault or transcurrent fault ) , the fault surface ( plane ) is usually near vertical , and the footwall moves laterally either left or right with very little vertical motion each is defined by the direction of movement of the ground as would be seen by an observer on the opposite side of the fault this class is related to an offset in a spreading center , such as a mid-ocean ridge , or , less common , within continental lithosphere , such as the dead sea transform in the middle east or the alpine fault in new zealand a thrust fault has the same sense of motion as a reverse fault , but with the dip of the fault plane at less than 45° the hade angle is defined as the complement of the dip angle ; it is the angle between the fault plane and a vertical plane that strikes parallel to the fault ring faults , also known as caldera faults , are faults that occur within collapsed volcanic calderas and the sites of bolide strikes , such as the chesapeake bay impact crater all faults have a measurable thickness , made up of deformed rock characteristic of the level in the crust where the faulting happened , of the rock types affected by the fault and of the presence and nature of any mineralising fluids the main types of fault rock include : cataclasite – a fault rock which is cohesive with a poorly developed or absent planar fabric , or which is incohesive , characterised by generally angular clasts and rock fragments in a finer-grained matrix of similar composition in california , for example , new building construction has been prohibited directly on or near faults that have moved within the holocene epoch ( the last 11,700 years ) of the earth 's geological history also , faults that have shown movement during the holocene plus pleistocene epochs ( the last 2.6 million years ) may receive consideration , especially for critical structures such as power plants , dams , hospitals , and schools fault motion animations at iris consortium aerial view of the san andreas fault in the carrizo plain , central california , from '' how earthquakes happen '' at usgs landsat image of the san andreas fault in southern california , from '' what is a fault ?
