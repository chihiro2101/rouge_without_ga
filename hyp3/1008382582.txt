when howard was six , his parents became naturalised as british subjects ( now called british citizens ) , and his surname was also changed following the parents ' naturalisation with the new surname howard he was one of a cluster of conservative students at cambridge university around this time , sometimes referred to as the '' cambridge mafia '' , many of whom held high government office under margaret thatcher and john major ( see : cambridge university conservative association ) he continued his career at the bar , becoming a practising queen 's counsel in 1982 ( unlike some barrister-mps who were awarded the title as an honorific despite no longer practising at the bar ) at the conservative party conference in october 1970 , he made a notable speech commending the government for attempting to curb trade union power and also called for state aid to strikers ' families to be reduced or stopped altogether , a policy which the thatcher government pursued over a decade later in the 1970s , howard was a leading advocate of british membership of the european union and served on the board of the cross-party britain in europe group in june 1982 , howard was selected to contest the constituency of folkestone and hythe in kent after the sitting conservative mp , sir albert costain , decided to retire after a period as minister for water and planning in 1988–89 , during which he was responsible for implementing water privatization in england and wales , howard was promoted to the cabinet as secretary of state for employment in january 1990 following the resignation of norman fowler he subsequently guided through legislation abolishing the closed shop , and campaigned vigorously for thatcher in the first ballot of the 1990 conservative party leadership contest , although he told her a day before she resigned that he felt she was n't going to win and that john major was better placed to defeat michael heseltine in this capacity he encouraged the united states to participate in the earth summit in rio de janeiro , but shortly afterwards he was appointed home secretary in a 1993 reshuffle precipitated by the sacking of norman lamont as chancellor howard repeatedly clashed with judges and prison reformers as he sought to clamp down on crime through a series of 'tough ' measures , such as reducing the right to silence of defendants in their police interviews and at their trials as part of 1994 's criminal justice and public order act the increased minimum term was overturned in 1997 by the house of lords , which ruled it was substantively '' ultra vires '' , and therefore '' unlawful '' , for the home secretary to decide on minimum sentences for young offenders the high court and european court of human rights have since ruled that , though parliament may set minimum and maximum terms for individual categories of crime , it is the responsibility of the trial judge , with the benefit of all the evidence and argument from both prosecution and defence counsel , to determine the minimum term in individual criminal cases shortly after the 1997 newsnight interview , ann widdecombe , his former minister of state at the home office , made a statement in the house of commons about the dismissal of then-director of the prison service , derek lewis , and remarked of howard that there is '' something of the night '' about him this much quoted comment is thought to have contributed to the failure of his 1997 bid for the conservative party leadership , including by howard and widdecombe , extract from crick 's book in search of michael howard following the 1997 resignation of john major , howard and william hague ran on the same ticket , with howard as leader and hague as deputy leader and party chairman after the conservative defeat at the 2001 general election , howard was recalled to frontline politics when the conservative party 's new leader , iain duncan smith , appointed him shadow chancellor of the exchequer after duncan smith was removed from the leadership , howard was elected unopposed as leader of the party in november 2003 he avoided repeating such managerial missteps as duncan smith 's firing of david davis as conservative party chairman and imposed discipline quickly and firmly : for example , he removed the party whip from ann winterton after she joked about 23 chinese migrants ' deaths the piece , which purported to show that members of the public could not identify howard and that those who recognised him did not support him , was the subject of an official complaint from the conservative party at the 2005 general election , howard 's conservative party suffered a third consecutive defeat , although the conservatives gained 33 seats ( including five from the liberal democrats ) and labour 's majority shrank from 167 to 66 the day after the election , howard stated in a speech in the newly gained conservative seat in putney that he would not lead the party into the next general election as , already aged 63 , he would be '' too old '' by that stage , and that he would stand down '' sooner rather than later '' , following a revision of the conservative leadership electoral process despite labour winning a third term in government , howard described the election as '' the beginning of a recovery '' for the conservative party following labour 's landslide victories in 1997 and 2001 howard 's own constituency of folkestone and hythe had been heavily targeted by the liberal democrats as the most sought after prize of their failed '' decapitation '' strategy of seeking to gain seats from prominent conservatives in the lead up to the election campaign , howard continued to impose strong party discipline , controversially forcing the deselection of danny kruger ( sedgefield ) , robert oulds and adrian hilton ( both slough ) and howard flight ( arundel & south downs ) despite his impending resignation after the 2005 general election , howard performed a substantial reshuffle of the party 's front bench in which several rising star mps were given their first shadow portfolios , including george osborne and david cameron this move cleared the way for cameron ( who had worked for howard as a special advisor when the latter was home secretary ) to stand for the conservative party leadership he also oversaw blair 's first parliamentary defeat , when the conservative party , the liberal democrats and sufficient labour party rebels voted against government proposals to extend to 90 days the period that terror suspects could be held for without charge on 28 may 2010 , howard was included in the 2010 dissolution honours to become a conservative life peer in the house of lords with the title of baron howard of lympne , of lympne in the county of kent in 2010 , david cameron wanted howard to join his cameron–clegg coalition , possibly as lord chancellor , via the house of lords as part of david cameron 's appeal to rightwing tories
