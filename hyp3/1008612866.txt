the olympic bidding process begins with the submission of a city 's application to the international olympic committee ( ioc ) by its national olympic committee ( noc ) and ends with the election of the host city by the members of the ioc during an ordinary session besides the initial nine applicant cities , other cities also wished to bid for the 2012 summer olympics , but the bids were not internally selected by the noc ( in case of more than one bidding city from the same country ) , were not put forward to the ioc , or were withdrawn before filing the necessary paperwork even though the panorama reporters clearly stated that the london bid was nowhere associated with the investigation , the bid officials made further statements claiming the team had no knowledge and involvement , hoping to distance themselves from the scandal : '' what i have to make clear is that london 2012 knew nothing about this—we have nothing to hide , '' said alan pascoe , a london 2012 vice chairman , committing to '' do everything we can to co-operate with the ioc enquiry and take this story off the running order '' the chairmen of the commonwealth games federation and the british olympic association , and spokesmen from downing street and london 2012 denied any violation of the ioc 's ethical code , insisting that blair 's comments were taken out of context as there was no intention to promote the bid the olympic emblem ( olympic rings ) is a copyrighted logo of the international olympic committee ( ioc ) ; the organization exclusively permits candidate cities , those high-scoring cities chosen from the applicant cities list , to use the olympic emblem in their bid logos on 23 december 2005 , alex gilady , an israeli ioc member and a member of the ioc 's london 2012 co-ordination commission , suggested that madrid should have tied for second spot with paris in the third round of voting , but did not do so because greek member lambis nikolaou pressed the wrong button in the united states , the city of new york was picked by the united states olympic committee ( usoc ) over san francisco , although several other cities submitted candidatures to become the american candidate for the 2012 olympics ; these included houston , washington d.c through analysis of the questionnaires , the ioc gave a weighted average score to each city based on the scores obtained in each of the questionnaire 's eleven themes : political and social support , general infrastructure , sports venues , olympic village , environment , accommodation , transport , security , past experience , finance , and legacy in recent history , however , the 2004 summer olympics and the 2006 winter olympics were both awarded to european nations , and president jacques rogge has said that back-to-back olympics in the same continent were not out of the question for future games on 4 august 2004 , bbc 's panorama broadcast the results of a year-long investigation in which the reporters posed as consultants from a fictitious firm '' new london ventures '' , which was supposed to represent businesses interested in bringing the 2012 olympics to london on 18 may 2004 , the ioc announced the cities accepted as candidates : paris — scored 8.5 ( bid details ) madrid — scored 8.3 ( bid details ) london — scored 7.6 ( bid details ) new york city — scored 7.5 ( bid details ) moscow — scored 6.5 ( bid details ) leipzig — scored 6.0 rio de janeiro — scored 5.1 istanbul — scored 4.8 havana — scored 3.7 in south america , the brazilian olympic committee chose rio de janeiro over são paulo , and if rio de janeiro had been selected by the ioc , it would have been the first olympiad staged in south america ( four years on , rio de janeiro did land the 2016 summer olympics ) knowing about the accusation , slavkov argued that he attended the meeting with the purpose of trying to frame the supposed corrupters , however the ethics commission report further stated that '' at no point does it emerge from the meeting that mr slavkov 's sole intention was to catch in the act these corrupters of ioc members following the announcement of the host city , the successful bid delegation signs the '' host city contract '' with the ioc , which delegates the responsibilities of the games organisation to the city and respective noc the paris bid team considered submitting a complaint against london bid consultants jim sloman and rod sheard after they stated that the stade de france was not adequate for athletics , an action that goes against the ioc rules which forbid any bid to make statements about a rival bid the undercover team secretly filmed its encounter with one of these agents , goran takac , who presented them to ivan slavkov , an ioc member and the bulgarian olympic committee 's president the voting is conducted in a succession of rounds until one bid achieves an absolute majority of votes ; if this does not happen in the first round , the bid with the fewest votes is eliminated and another voting round begins at no time and in no way did mr slavkov object to this discussion of the terms of a contract to secure a candidate city the votes of ioc members whom he and mr takac were likely to be able to influence ''
