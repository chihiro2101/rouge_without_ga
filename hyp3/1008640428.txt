these personnel are ordinarily assigned to the brigade 's headquarters and headquarters company in the argentinian army , the typical brigade is composed of an hq company , two or three battalions ( called '' regiments '' for historical reasons ) of the brigadeÂ´s main branch ( infantry or armoured cavalry ) , which give the brigade its denomination ( mechanized , armoured , airborne , mountain or jungle ) , plus one battalion of the other branch , plus one or two artillery groups , an engineers battalion or company , a signals company , and intelligence company , an army aviation section and a logistics battalion before 1922 , british army brigades were normally commanded by general officers holding the rank of brigadier-general ( equivalent to a '' one-star '' rank in the us army ) ; after that date , the brigade commander was an appointment for officers with the rank of brigadier , which were then classified as field officers not general officers it was decided in 2016 to again form two divisions ( 1st and 3rd ) made up of four and three brigades for a total of seven brigades : two armored , two '' intermediate '' , two light brigades ( alpine and parachute ) and the franco-german brigade another theory for derivation of the term brigade derives from italian , as used for example in the introduction to the decameron , where it refers only to a group of ten , or old french meaning '' company '' of an undefined size , which in turn derives from a celtic root , which means '' strife '' the main core of the norwegian army is the brigade nord , consisting of eight battalions of which four are combat battalions ( one infantry , one mechanized infantry , one artillery and one armored ) and the rest are various types of support battalions the fairly large size of the combat ready support contingent is also intended to complement the heimevernet ( translates as '' home defense '' ) which is a large reserve infantry force , as well as act in a support capacity for an international cooperation force ( e.g in france , marshal turenne ( 1611-1675 ) copied the brigade organization ; he made it a permanent standing unit , requiring the creation in 1667 of a permanent rank of ( literally translating to '' brigadier of the armies of the king '' ) in the australian army , the brigade has always been the smallest tactical formation , since regiments are either administrative groupings of battalions ( in the infantry ) or battalion-sized units ( in the cavalry ) in 1938 , the royal artillery adopted the term '' regiment '' for this size of unit , and '' brigade '' became used in its normal sense , particularly for groups of anti-aircraft artillery regiments commanded by a brigadier the meb organizational structure consists of a minimum of three regimental-equivalent sized units and a command element ( a regimental combat team , a composite marine aircraft group , a marine logistics regiment , and a meb headquarters group ) , brigades not permanently assigned to a division , were commanded by brigadier generals the brigade : a history : its organization and employment in the us army , chapter 6 , the early modern brigade , 1958-1972 , road brigades and airmobile brigades , p '' the brigade as a military unit came about starting in the 15th century when the british army and militia developed a unit to control more than one infantry regiment or cavalry squadron '' the meu consists of three battalion-equivalent sized units and a command element ( a battalion landing team , a marine medium tilt-rotor squadron ( reinforced ) , a combat logistics battalion , and a meu headquarters group ) , colonel , lieutenant colonel , or major ) or battery commander ( usually a captain ) reporting directly to the field force or '' army '' commander a typical brigade may consist of approximately 5,500 personnel between two mechanised infantry battalions , an armoured regiment , an armoured artillery regiment , and other logistic and engineering units as such a '' field army '' became larger , the number of subordinate commanders became unmanageable for the officer in general command of said army , usually a major general , to effectively command the invention of the brigade overcame the lack of coordination inherent in the traditional army structure consisting of independent regiments of infantry and units of supporting arms ( viz the canadian army currently has three regular force brigade groups , designated as canadian mechanized brigade groups ( cmbg ) : 1 cmbg , 2 cmbg , which contain the regular army 's anglophone units , and 5 cmbg , the regular francophone formation the brigade is usually commanded by an officer holding the rank of brigadier , who is referred to as the '' brigade commander ''
