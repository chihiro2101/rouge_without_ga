it was , however , only one of the many different ways that the customs officer 's name was rendered , even in official documents he may have been born earlier than this , since one of amerike 's daughters , joan , was married to a future lawyer , john broke , by april 1479 1–13 peter fleming and kieran costello , discovering cabot 's bristol ( bristol , 1998 ) amerike prospered as a merchant and , after 1485 , as a gentleman and an officer of the crown unfortunately when amerike shipped on the trinity of bristol for a voyage to andalucia in 1480 the purser , whose private accounts survive , failed to record the mark of amerike , or indeed of any other merchant shipping 86 , mark 480 in 1485 richard amerike was appointed to the customs service in bristol 's neighbouring port of bridgwater , with the post of controller of customs in september 1486 amerike became one of the customs officials in bristol , holding the post of king 's customs officer , known as a 'customer ' , from 1486 until december 1502 during his period of office he was several times accused of malpractice , including false accounting , and was obliged to pay a substantial sum of money to the king , henry vii , for his pardon under the authority of king henry vii of england john cabot led three voyages of discovery from bristol in search of new lands and a route to the supposed riches of the east the second , in 1497 , was the famous expedition in the matthew of bristol , which found 'new land ' that cabot thought was part of asia but was probably the modern newfoundland however , no list of sponsors has ever been found , and the only proven funding , in amounts insufficient for a voyage , came from the london branch of the florentine banking house of the bardi and , in 1498 , from henry vii the idea that richard amerike was an important supporter of cabot gained currency in the late 20th century among popular historians , as did the notion that amerike was owner and main funder of the matthew , cabot 's ship of 1497 indeed , they suggest that ap meryk may have been hostile to cabot because the terms of the explorer 's royal patent would have made it difficult for the port 's customs officers to profit from any trade established to new lands this may explain why the customs officers created problems for the explorer by refusing to pay the initial instalment of the pension he was granted in december 1497 , despite the existence of an order from the king stating that this should happen amerike , and his fellow customs officer , arthur kemys , were the paymasters for the pension of £20 a year granted by henry vii to john cabot on 13 december 1497 cabot 's grant specified that he was to be paid out of revenues arising from the customs dues payable to the crown on goods exported and imported in the port of bristol by way of merchandise local payment in bristol made a lot of sense for the explorer and , provided all the documentation was in order , amerike and kemys would then be able to claim the payment to cabot as a legitimate expense when they accounted for their revenues in the exchequer at the end of the accounting year in the mid-1890s edward scott , a 'keeper ' or senior archivist at the british museum , and from 1891 keeper of the muniments in westminster abbey , discovered a stray exchequer document that showed this process and two years-worth of pension payments to cabot by amerike and his colleague in 1497–1499 in 1908 , the local bristol antiquarian alfred hudd first proposed the theory that the word america had evolved from amerike or ap meryk hudd proposed his theory in a paper which was read at 21 may 1908 meeting of the clifton antiquarian club , and which appeared in volume 7 of the club 's proceedings while hudd 's speculation has found support from more than one 21st century author , who expanded hudd 's argument by speculations about the matthew , and with theories supposing a connection between the ap meric coat of arms and the design of the stars and stripes , there is no hard proof to substantiate the theory that cabot named america after richard ameryk rodney broome , terra incognita : the true story of how america got its name , ( us 2001 : rodney broome , amerike : the briton who gave america its name , ( uk 2002 : felipe fernández-armesto , amerigo , the man who gave his name to america , ( uk 2006 : evan t
