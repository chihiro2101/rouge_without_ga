vaudreuil and others had expressed their concern at the possibility of l'anse-au-foulon being vulnerable , but montcalm dismissed them , saying 100 men would hold off the army until daylight , remarking , '' it is not to be supposed that the enemies have wings so that they can in the same night cross the river , disembark , climb the obstructed acclivity , and scale the walls , for which last operation they would have to carry ladders while the regular french forces were approaching from beauport and quebec , the canadian militia and native sharpshooters engaged the british left flank , sheltering in the trees and scrub ; the militia held these positions throughout the battle and fell back on this line during the general retreat , eventually holding the bridge over the st volunteer james henderson , with the louisbourg grenadiers , had been tasked with holding the hill , and reported afterwards that within moments of the command to fire , wolfe was struck with two shots , one low in the stomach and the second , a mortal wound in the chest . thumb wolfe , positioned with the 28th foot and the louisbourg grenadiers , had moved to a rise to observe the battle ; he had been struck in the wrist early in the fight , but had wrapped the injury and continued on on the morning of 13 september , wolfe 's army formed a line first with their backs to the river , then spread out across the plains with its right anchored by the bluff along the st . though he might have awaited reinforcement by bougainville 's column ( allowing simultaneous frontal and rear attacks on the british position ) or avoided battle while he concentrated his forces , or even yielded the city to wolfe , he instead elected to confront wolfe 's force directly though his regular regiments ( the '' troupes de terre '' or '' metropolitans '' ) were adept at such formal warfare , in the course of the campaign their ranks had been replenished by less professional militiamen , whose talents at forest warfare emphasised the individual : they tended to fire early and then drop to the ground to reload , thus reducing the effect of concentrated fire at close range . when the boats , loaded with the first wave of british troops , were challenged , a french-speaking officer , either a captain fraser or captain donald mcdonald of the 78th fraser highlanders , was able to answer the challenge in excellent french , allaying suspicion image : battlefields park tables and martello tower.jpg thumb martello tower ( constructed by the british 1808–1812 ) in the battlefields park , quebec city in 2009 , a number of activities were proposed to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the battle of the plains of abraham a plan to hold a reenactment of the battle itself ( as well as a reenactment of the subsequent french victory of 1760 at the battle of sainte-foy ) was cancelled due to threats of public disorder he quickly formed up two battalions from the confused troops on the field and turned them to meet the oncoming french , a day-saving manoeuvre ; instead of attacking with a well rested and ready force , bougainville retreated while the rest of montcalm 's army slipped back across the st such actions required a disciplined soldiery , painstakingly drilled for as long as 18 months on the parade ground , trained to march in time , change formation at a word , and retain cohesion in the face of bayonet charges and musket volleys thus , by the time the sun rose over the plains of abraham , wolfe 's army had a solid foothold at the top of the cliffs of the promontory of quebec in total , montcalm had 13,390 regular troops , troupes de la marine , and militia available in quebec city and along the beauport shore , as well as 200 cavalry , 200 artillery ( including the guns of quebec ) , 300 first nations ( including many odawa under charles de langlade the treaty of paris was signed in 1763 to end the war and gave possession of parts of new france to great britain , including canada and the eastern half of french louisiana—lying between the mississippi river and the appalachian mountains watercolour by charles william jefferys ( 1869–1951 ) as french troops arrived from beauport , montcalm , one of few mounted men on the field , decided that a swift assault was the only way to dislodge the british from their position british army en potence on the right flank – 35th regiment of foot in reserve – 48th regiment of foot protecting rear – the light infantry ( 80th regiment of light-armed foot ) main line under major general james wolfe louisbourg grenadiers ( 3 companies ) 22nd regiment of foot ( only grenadier and light infantry companies ) 40th regiment of foot ( only grenadier and light infantry companies ) 45th regiment of foot right wing under brigadier general robert monckton 28th regiment of foot 43rd regiment of foot 1 light field gun provided by royal artillery centre under brigadier general james murray 47th regiment of foot 58th regiment of foot ( also guarding the landing place ) fraser 's highlanders 1 light field gun provided by royal artillery left flank under brigadier general george townshend 15th regiment of foot 2nd battalion , 60th ( royal american ) regiment of foot 3rd battalion , 60th ( royal american ) regiment of foot colonials the light infantry ( 80th regiment of light-armed foot ) ( protecting the rear ) 6 companies of american rangers . the success of the french army 's offensive against quebec in the spring of 1760 had depended on the dispatch of a french armada , with fresh troops and supplies left the plateau was undefended save for vergor 's camp , as vaudreuil had ordered one of the french regiments to relocate to the east of the city not long before the landing decided to abandon quebec and the beauport shore , ordering all of his forces to march west and eventually join up with bougainville , leaving the garrison in quebec under the command of jean-baptiste nicolas roch de ramezay a group of 24 volunteers led by colonel william howe with fixed bayonets were sent to clear the picket along the road , and climbed the slope , a maneuver that allowed them to come up behind vergor 's camp and capture it quickly . the first notice of the landing came from a runner who had fled from vergor 's camp , but one of montcalm 's aides felt the man was mad and sent him away , then went back to bed . as wolfe 's men waited for the defenders , the steady fire became intense enough that wolfe ordered his men to lie down amid the high grass and brush . captain john knox , serving with the 43rd foot , wrote in his journal that as the french came within range , the regiments '' gave them , with great calmness , as remarkable a close and heavy discharge as i ever saw ''
