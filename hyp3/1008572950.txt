thumb according to the primary chronicle , oleg was a relative ( likely brother-in-law ) of the first ruler , rurik , and was entrusted by rurik to take care of both his kingdom and his young son igor oleg gradually took control of the dnieper cities , seizing the power in kiev by tricking and slaying askold and dir , and naming kiev the capital of his newly created state kievan rus ' the primary chronicles brief account of oleg 's life contrasts with other early sources , specifically the novgorod first chronicle , which states that oleg was not related to rurik , and was rather a scandinavian client-prince who served as igor 's army commander in the primary chronicle , oleg is known as the prophet ( вещий ) , an epithet alluding to the sacred meaning of his norse name ( '' priest '' ) oleg 's death has been interpreted as a distorted variant of the threefold death theme in indo-european myth and legend , with prophecy , the snake and the horse representing the three functions : the prophecy is associated with sovereignty , the horse with warriors , and the serpent with reproduction x : x ) a document written by a jewish khazar , a contemporary of romanus i lecapenus , describes the activities of a rus ' warlord named hlgw ( hebrew : , usually transcribed as '' helgu '' mosin proposed that hlgw was a different person from oleg and was an independent prince in tmutarakan ; the existence of an independent rus ' state in tmutarakan in the first half of the tenth century is rejected by virtually all modern scholars recently , however , scholars such as david christian and constantine zuckerman have suggested that the schechter letter 's account is corroborated by various other russian chronicles , and suggests a struggle within the early rus ' polity between factions loyal to oleg and to the rurikid igor , a struggle that oleg ultimately lost among zuckerman 's beliefs and those of others who have analyzed these sources are that the khazars did not lose kiev until the early 10th century ( rather than 882 , the traditional date pritsak 60-71 ; shahmatov xxxii-xxxiii ; ) , that igor was not rurik 's son but rather a more distant descendant , and that oleg did not immediately follow rurik , but rather that there is a lost generation between the legendary varangian lord and his documented successors of particular interest is the fact that the schechter letter account of oleg 's death ( namely , that he fled to and raided frs , tentatively identified with persia , pavel kokovtsov , when publishing a russian translation of the letter in 1932 , argued that frs may refer to thrace , where the rus ' forces were defeated by the armies of lecapenus ( online ) and was slain there ) bears remarkable parallels to the account of arab historians such as ibn miskawayh , who described a similar rus ' attack on the muslim state of arran in the year 944/5 furthermore , scholars have pointed out that if oleg succeeded rurik in 879 ( as the east slavic chronicles assert ) , he could hardly have been active almost 70 years later , unless he had a life-span otherwise unheard of in medieval annals to solve these difficulties , it has been proposed that the pagan monarch-priests of rus ' used the hereditary title of helgu , standing for '' holy '' in the norse language , and that igor and others held this title petrukhin speculated that helgu-oleg of the 940s was one of the vernacular princes of chernigov , whose ruling dynasty maintained especially close contacts with khazaria , as the findings at the black grave , a large royal kurgan excavated near chernigov , seem to testify
