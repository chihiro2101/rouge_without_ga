modern surfboards are usually made of foam using one of the following construction materials : polyurethane ( pu foam ) with polyester resin have been used in surfboards since the 1950s , and is , therefore , the oldest of the modern construction methods since the late 1960s when gordon clark found the optimum formulation of urethane foam , many of the surfboards in common use have been of the shortboard variety between in length with a pointed nose and a rounded or squarish tail , typically with three '' skegs '' ( fins ) but sometimes with two or as many as five the main inspiration , apart from beauty , is that this is a more environmentally friendly method of construction ( compared to epoxy and polyurethane methods ) which uses fast-growing plantation wood such as paulownia , cedar , spruce , redwood , and , of course , balsa the construction is referred to as a sandwich as it consists of the top skin , fiberglass or other composite cloth , the eps core , fiberglass or other composite cloth , and the bottom skin , the cross section of which appears as a sandwich with the different layers surfers generally find a shortboard quick to maneuver compared with other types of surfboards , but because of a lack of flotation due to the smaller size , the shortboard is harder to catch waves with , often requiring steeper , larger and more powerful waves and very late takeoffs , where the surfer catches the wave at the critical moment before it breaks this construction method entails hand- or machine-shaping a foam blank from eps foam and then vacuum-bagging or hand-laminating a more dense layer of foam , wood , or carbon onto the bottom and deck of the eps foam core , usually separating the two layers with lightweight fiberglass cloth ( 2 & nbsp ; oz & nbsp ; pr note , any type of board ( such as shortboard or mini-longboard ) can have a fish tail , and these are commonly referred to as a '' fish '' , but they lack the other properties of a traditional , or '' retro '' fish as described here depending , amongst other things , on : boardcave australia the surfers corner skill , fitness and surfing style expected wave conditions body dimensions of the surfer ( height and weight ) traditionally board lengths have been sized according to the height of the surfer , meaning in general that longer boards would be recommended for taller surfers the best beginner surfboard is the funboard the funboard 's design allows waves to be caught more easily than a shortboard , yet with a shape that makes it more maneuverable than a longboard ; hence it is a popular type of surfboard , especially among beginners or those transitioning from longboarding to the more difficult shortboarding hollow wooden surfboards are made of wood and epoxy or oil ( as a sustainable alternative to epoxy ) , and are a reversion to using wood after the foam became dominant in the 1950s classic tricks that can be performed on a malibu are '' hang fives '' and '' hang tens '' whereby the surfer walks to the nose of the board and hangs 5 or 10 toes over the nose , the '' soul arch '' , drop knee turns , head dips , switch stance maneuvers , and so on in the proper conditions , a skilled surfer can ride a wave standing on the nose of a longboard with their toes over the nose 's edge : in this way , with the '' toes on the nose '' , the surfer can '' hang ten '' in construction , the stringer can have no special parts , or can embed a stiff , thin , vertical slat , usually of wood but sometimes of carbon fiber , running from nose to tail a drawback to eps is that it is difficult to shape by hand , and eps boards are therefore typically made using machines where the shaping of the foam is near completed after the molding itself the nose rocker or flip is the curve between the front tip and the middle or flattest portion of the board , and the tail rocker or kick is that between the tail and the middle/ flattest portion the camber is angled front in and top in , directing energy from the incoming wave to lift the board and straighten it , not dissimilar from the force vectoring provided by the geometry of a rocket 's nozzle the surfers corner - pu or epoxy : which one is best ? '' as most of us can ’ t afford a large quiver of boards , one really solid option you can consider is looking at having your board made with pu foam and epoxy resin the purpose of winglets , as in airplane design , is to increase lift ( horizontal turning force in the case of surfboard fins ) while reducing drag , by reducing the fin-tip vortex the reason epoxy resin is used exclusively instead of polyester resin on these boards , is that the polystyrene foam reacts chemically upon contact with polyester resin , causing the ps foam to melt the parallel profile system was developed from cold molded ( double diagonal ) boat building , and uses at least four layers of material laminated over a male mold into a curved blank , including enough wood for rails , which are then shaped most concaves on the modern shortboard begin about back from the nose of the board on the bottom and then carry out through the middle to the tail of the surfboard the soft skin is vacuumed to the cloth and epoxy so that the soft shell is exposed -- - meaning the hard glass and resin are protected inside , and under , the soft cush skin this will give you the trusty feel and performance of your standard board , but with the added strength of epoxy resin instead of polyester '' pu is still the most used material in surf board construction today modern leashes comprise a urethane rope where one end has a band with a velcro strap attached to the surfer 's trailing foot , and the opposite has a velcro strap attached to the tail end of the surfboard some drawbacks are the toxicity of the material , that it is non-recyclable and that the pu foam is more flexible than some alternatives , making the board less stiff so that it can bend and twist more during use the american surfer tom blake was the first to experiment with adding a fin to a surfboard , fastening the keel from an old speedboat to a surfboard in 1935 a bonzer is a surfboard designed by the campbell brothers that can have three or five fins and is punctuated with a large center fin and 2-4 smaller side fins ( side bites ) these systems provided surfers with the ability to alter the riding characteristics of a surfboard , by changing the size and shape of fins used the '' skin '' , made of a gloss coated foam , is stretched and adhered while vacuumed over the surface of the entire epoxy surfboard the purpose of the cush is for dampening of chatter , absorption of impact landings , airs , grip , and overall added protection for a light epoxy board the energy is lost as the board goes up the wave because the fins are now vectoring energy from the oncoming water toward the back of the board , bleeding speed in malibu ( in los angeles county ) , the beach was so popular amongst the early surfers that it lent its name to the type of longboard , the malibu surfboard finally , the board is covered in one or more layers of fiberglass cloth and resin there are several names for this piece of foam applied to the top of a surfboard to increase the grip and allow surfers to have more control and perform more high performance maneuvers in the early days , surfers would stabilize the board by hanging the toes of their back foot over the edge of the board and would steer by putting their foot in the water jack o'neill lost his left eye in a surf leash accident as the surgical tubing used in the early designs allowed the leash to overstretch , causing the surfboard to fly back towards the surfer gault-williams , malcolm ( 2003 ) “ woody 'spider ' brown ” legendary surfers : a definitive history of surfing 's culture and heroes , volume 1 , chapter 24 ( originally : “ woody brown : pilot , surfer , sailor , ” the surfer 's journal , v:3 , fall 1996 surfing magazine may 1979 volume 15 number 5 , page 9 in october 1980 , after seeing a twin fin surfboard with a '' trigger point '' fin simon anderson had the idea for a new , equal size , version of the existing three fin prototypes which was later dubbed the '' thruster '' polystyrene ( ps foam ) with epoxy has a lower weight , but is not as strong as the more traditional pu foam primarily a twin fin set up with a swallow tail shape and popular in smaller waves , the fish enjoyed a resurgence in popularity in the early 2000s after legendary surfer tom curren rode one during an asp event at hossegor the fins of the 2+1 take the rigid stability of a classic longboard , and fuses with the strength and drive of a tri-fin larger , fuller rails contain a greater volume of foam giving the board increased buoyancy along the edge , while sharper , narrower rails have less volume , making the board easier to '' sink '' and '' lean on edge '' the funboard combines elements of both shortboards and longboards and are generally midsized , usually have a length of , thickness of and width of but many surfers live by a philosophy of finding the joy of surfing a mix of boards and surfing styles to suit the waves of the day about one or two years later , woody brown ( surfer ) independently developed a similar design , but brown himself gave blake precedence : '' ( i made my first surfboard keel ) about '36 or '37 , somewhere in there ; about the same time one of the most recent modern advancements in surfboard technology is the creation of high performance boards which are wrapped in a stretchable soft skin which does not absorb water some older and more traditional surfboards along with many modern boards that take inspiration from these older boards utilize a convex rather than concave design on the bottom of the surfboard in the 1960s , the introduction of the shortboard , averaging , allowed surfers to make tighter turns , quicker maneuvers , and achieve faster speeds , thus radically changing the way people surfed the additional fins ensure that even what riding down the line , two , or at least one , vertical control surface is in black water ( not unstable foam ) allows riders better turning capabilities a rounded rail is called '' soft '' , while a more squared-off rail is called '' hard '' , and rails that are in between are termed '' 50/50 '' ( '' fifty-fifty '' ) additionally , there is a revival of stand-up paddle-based surfing with boards up to in length ( for stability ) in the 1960s , the longboard continued to remain popular as its material changed from balsa wood to fiberglass and polyurethane foam the chambering method follows a system in which planks of paulownia wood are selected and the rocker of the board is cut into each why do sups have air vents ? difference between hassle free air vents & screw type air vents on stand up paddle boards extruded polystyrene ( xps foam ) is somewhat heavier than eps , and usually weighs as much as pu or more there are several brands of surfboard traction pads on the market , but the most popular brands include ; dakine , pro-lite , waxmat , cush , oam and famous more recently however , the weight of the surfer has also started to be taken into account , meaning in general that a heavier surfer would be recommended a board with more volume
