sharpe ( 1964 ) , john lintner ( 1965a , b ) and jan mossin ( 1966 ) independently , building on the earlier work of harry markowitz on diversification and modern portfolio theory fischer black ( 1972 ) developed another version of capm , called black capm or zero-beta capm , that does not assume the existence of a riskless asset an investor in a large , diversified portfolio ( such as a mutual fund ) , therefore , expects performance in line with the market the risk of a portfolio comprises systematic risk , also known as undiversifiable risk , and specific risk which is also known as idiosyncratic risk or diversifiable risk depending on the market , a portfolio of approximately 30–40 securities in developed markets such as the uk or us will render the portfolio sufficiently diversified such that risk exposure is limited to systematic risk only therefore , the required return on an asset , that is , the return that compensates for risk taken , must be linked to its riskiness in a portfolio context—i.e the capm assumes that the risk-return profile of a portfolio can be optimized—an optimal portfolio displays the lowest possible level of risk for its level of return additionally , since each additional asset introduced into a portfolio further diversifies the portfolio , the optimal portfolio must comprise every asset , ( assuming no trading costs ) with each asset value-weighted to achieve the above ( assuming that any asset is infinitely divisible ) in their 2004 review , economists eugene fama and kenneth french argue that '' the failure of the capm in empirical tests implies that most applications of the model are invalid '' this would be implied by the assumption that returns are normally distributed , or indeed are distributed in any two-parameter way , but for general return distributions other risk measures ( like coherent risk measures ) will reflect the active and potential shareholders ' preferences more adequately indeed , risk in financial investments is not variance in itself , rather it is the probability of losing : it is asymmetric in nature the model assumes that all active and potential shareholders have access to the same information and agree about the risk and expected return of all assets ( homogeneous expectations assumption ) this possibility is studied in the field of behavioral finance , which uses psychological assumptions to provide alternatives to the capm such as the overconfidence-based asset pricing model of kent daniel , david hirshleifer , and avanidhar subrahmanyam ( 2001 ) either that fact is itself rational ( which saves the efficient-market hypothesis but makes capm wrong ) , or it is irrational ( which saves capm , but makes the emh wrong – indeed , this possibility makes volatility arbitrage a strategy for reliably beating the market ) the model assumes that given a certain expected return , active and potential shareholders will prefer lower risk ( lower variance ) to higher risk and conversely given a certain level of risk will prefer higher returns to lower ones the market portfolio should in theory include all types of assets that are held by anyone as an investment ( including works of art , real estate , human capital ) in practice , such a market portfolio is unobservable and people usually substitute a stock index as a proxy for the true market portfolio unfortunately , it has been shown that this substitution is not innocuous and can lead to false inferences as to the validity of the capm , and it has been said that due to the inobservability of the true market portfolio , the capm might not be empirically testable the basic insights of the model are extended and generalized in the intertemporal capm ( icapm ) of robert merton , and the consumption capm ( ccapm ) of douglas breeden and mark rubinstein the irrationality refers to the capm proclaimed ‘ revision of prices ’ resulting in identical discount rates for the ( lower ) amount of covariance risk only as for the ( higher ) amount of total risk ( i.e the capital asset pricing model ( capm ) , short-sale restrictions and related issues , journal of finance , 32 ( 177 ) stone , bernell k
