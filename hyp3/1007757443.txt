in such an order , the reserve powers are thought to be the means by which the monarch and his or her viceregal representatives can legitimately exist as '' constitutional guardians '' or '' umpires '' , tasked with guaranteeing that cabinet and parliament adhere to the fundamental constitutional principles of the rule of law and responsible government itself some constitutional scholars , such as george winterton , have stated that reserve powers are a good thing in that they allow for a head of state to handle an unforeseen crisis and that the use of convention to limit the use of reserve powers allows for more gradual and subtle constitutional evolution than is possible through formal amendment of a written constitution evatt felt that the reserve powers could be codified and still serve their intended function in a responsible government system , as they do in ireland , japan , and sweden in belgium a constitutional provision explicitly states that no act of the monarch is valid without the signature of a member or members of the government , which thereby becomes solely responsible , hence excluding any reserve power for the crown within the dominions , until the 1920s , most reserve powers were exercised by a governor-general on the advice of either the local or the british government , though the latter took precedence for example , the first governor-general of the irish free state , tim healy , was instructed by the british dominions office in 1922 to withhold the royal assent on any bill passed by the two houses of the oireachtas ( the irish parliament ) that attempted to change or abolish the oath of allegiance while the reserve power to dismiss a government has not been used in the united kingdom since 1834 , this power has been exercised more recently in australia , on two occasions : on 13 may 1932 , when the governor of new south wales philip game lang dismissal crisis in queensland in 1987 , during a tense period of leadership succession , the governor of queensland , sir walter campbell , exercised reserve power in declining to follow the advice of the premier , sir joh bjelke-petersen owen dixon society ejournal ( gold coast , queensland : bond university , 2007 ) there was speculation on the potential exercise of vice-regal reserve power by campbell , in dismissing the premier in the absence of a parliamentary motion of no confidence the reserve powers in canada fall within the royal prerogative and belong specifically to the monarch , as the constitution act , 1867 , vests all executive power in the country 's sovereign '' the reserve power of dismissal has never been used in canada , although other reserve powers have been employed to force the prime minister to resign on two occasions : the first took place in 1896 , when the prime minister , sir charles tupper , refused to step down after his party did not win a majority in the house of commons during that year 's election , leading governor general the earl of aberdeen to no longer recognize tupper as prime minister and disapprove of several appointments tupper had recommended on the second occasion , which took place in 1925 and came to be known as the king-byng affair , prime minister william lyon mackenzie king , facing a non-confidence motion in the house of commons , advised the governor general , the viscount byng of vimy , to dissolve the new parliament , but byng refused peter hogg , a constitutional scholar , has opined that '' a system of responsible government can not work without a formal head of state who is possessed of certain reserve powers though the power of appointment is listed among the reserve powers , in fact the governor-general abides by strict conventions , and has always appointed the leader of the dominant party in the house of representatives the governor-general retains the theoretical power to appoint as prime minister a member of the house of representatives who clearly does not have the support of a majority of mps , but no governor-general has sought to use this power since new zealand gained responsible government , though some cabinets in the 19th century proved extremely short-lived however , all elections since responsible government was introduced , including snap elections , have been requested by the incumbent premier or prime minister , and are accordingly not examples of use of the reserve powers if a prime minister has been defeated by a vote of no confidence , a refusal by the governor-general to dissolve parliament would , in effect , force the prime minister to resign and make way for a successor a constitutional crisis occurred in saint kitts and nevis in 1981 , when the governor , sir probyn inniss , used his reserve powers to refuse assent to a bill passed by the government of sir kennedy simmonds , the country 's premier the constitution of tuvalu provides , in article 52 , that the governor-general exercises his powers '' only in accordance with the advice of ( a ) the cabinet ; or ( b ) the prime minister the opposition immediately called for the government to reconvene parliament , so that a motion of no confidence could be introduced , and a new government formed in the uk , the monarch has numerous theoretical personal prerogatives , but beyond the appointment of a prime minister , there are in practice few circumstances in modern british government where these prerogatives could be justifiably exercised ; they have rarely been exercised in the last century to summon and prorogue parliament to command the armed forces to dismiss and appoint ministers to commission officers in the armed forces to appoint queen 's counsel to issue and withdraw passports to create corporations via royal charter to appoint bishops and archbishops of the church of england to grant honours to grant the prerogative of mercy to delay a bill 's assent through the use of his or her reserve powers in near-revolutionary situations , thereby vetoing the bill to refuse the royal assent of a parliamentary bill on the advice of ministers , thomas erskine may 's parliamentary practice , page 373 , 2nd edition , 1851 last exercised by queen anne when she withheld royal assent from the scottish militia bill 1708 to declare war and peace to deploy the armed forces overseas to ratify and make treaties to refuse the '' queen 's consent queen 's king 's consent '' , where direct monarchical assent is required for a bill affecting , directly or by implication , the prerogative , hereditary revenues—including ultimus haeres , treasure trove , and bona vacantia—or the personal property or interests of the crown to be heard in parliament following japan 's defeat in world war ii , the emperor 's role is defined in chapter i of the 1947 constitution of japan , as decided by the foreign powers that had defeated japan in the war it states that the sovereignty of japan rests with the people , not the emperor , and that the emperor is merely the symbol of the state and of the unity of the people the constitution of spain does not specifically grant emergency powers to the government , though does state in article 56 that the monarch '' arbitrates and moderates the regular functioning of the institutions '' , and invests the monarch with the responsibility of overseeing that the forms of the constitution are observed he arbitrates and moderates the regular functioning of the institutions , assumes the highest representation of the spanish state in international relations , especially with the nations of its historical community , and exercises the functions expressly conferred on him by the constitution and the laws the spanish constitution of 1978 , title ii the crown , article 62 , delineates the powers of the king , while title iv government and administration , article 99 , defines the king 's role in government to be informed of the affairs of state and , for this purpose , to preside over the meetings of the council of ministers whenever , he sees fit , at the president of the government 's request following the general election of the cortes generales ( cortes ) , and other circumstances provided for in the constitution , the king meets with and interviews the political party leaders represented in the congress of deputies , and then consults with the congress of deputies ( spain ) ( officially , presidente de congreso de los diputados de españa , who , in this instance , represents the whole of the cortes generales ) before nominating his candidate for the presidency , according to section 99 of title iv title iv government and administration section 99 ( 1 ) & ( 2 ) ( 1 ) after each renewal of the congress and the other cases provided for under the constitution , the king shall , after consultation with the representatives appointed by the political groups with parliamentary representation , and through the speaker of the congress , nominate for the presidency of the government under the constitution of sweden , the supreme executive authority is the government ( composed of the prime minister and other cabinet ministers ) , which is responsible to the riksdag the king , however , is not subordinate to the government and thus could play an independent role as moral authority , but the prevailing convention , expressed in the preparatory works of the 1974 instrument of government , is that the king should stay away from anything which could reasonably be interpreted as courtyard speech reserve powers can also be written into a republican constitution that separates the offices of head of state and head of government this was the case in germany under the weimar republic and is still the case in the french fifth republic , the italy republic , and the republic of ireland in most states , the head of state 's ability to exercise reserve powers is explicitly defined and regulated by the text of the constitution during the regime of the caretaker government , the president 's power expanded dramatically ; effectively ( s ) he is no longer a ceremonial head of state article 81 of the german constitution states the possibility that the president can by this means keep a government capable of action even in case of loss of a constructive majority in the bundestag the president of ireland does not possess executive powers : executive powers are held by the government , which is headed by a taoiseach ( prime minister ) , who is chosen by and accountable to dáil éireann ( house of representatives ) for the most part , these ceremonial duties may be performed only on the authority , and with the binding advice , of the government however , the president has certain reserve powers , also known as '' discretionary powers '' in ireland , which can be exercised by the president at his or her discretion – without , or even contrary to , the government 's advice the question of whether or not the taoiseach has lost the confidence of the dáil could be a discretionary matter for the president to decide – in principle , the president could refuse to dissolve the dáil on the advice of a taoiseach who has not yet been defeated in a vote of no-confidence , but who appears likely to be defeated were such a vote to be held in addition to these powers , the president has various other discretionary powers in the constitution , which are of lesser political significance ( in normal circumstances ) generally , owing to the way in which the seanad is elected , the government 's coalition controls a majority of the seats , and strong party discipline means that senators rarely go against their own party , so getting seanad support for a referendum is difficult however , prior to their exercise , the president is bound , in most cases , to consult the council of state , an advisory body consisting of a mixture of senior ex-officio and nominated members the president of the republic : can send official messages to the chambers of parliament ; appoints the prime minister of italy ; may appoint up to five senator for life ; appoints a third of the judges of the constitutional court ; can grant pardons and commutation of sentence ; can call for new elections for both or only one of the chambers , except during the last six months of his term
