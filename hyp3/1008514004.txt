the first step to understanding the importance of macrophages in muscle repair , growth , and regeneration is that there are two '' waves '' of macrophages with the onset of damageable muscle use & nbsp ; – subpopulations that do and do not directly have an influence on repairing muscle as secretory cells , monocytes and macrophages are vital to the regulation of immune responses and the development of inflammation ; they produce a wide array of powerful chemical substances ( monokines ) including enzymes , complement proteins , and regulatory factors such as interleukin-1 in contrast , the m2 '' repair '' designation ( also referred to as alternatively activated macrophages ) broadly refers to macrophages that function in constructive processes like wound healing and tissue repair , and those that turn off damaging immune system activation by producing anti-inflammatory cytokines like il-10 macrophages can be protective in different ways : they can remove dead tumor cells ( in a process called phagocytosis ) following treatments that kill these cells ; they can serve as drug depots for some anticancer drugs ; they can also be activated by some therapies to promote antitumor immunity this role is important in chronic inflammation , as the early stages of inflammation are dominated by neutrophils , which are ingested by macrophages if they come of age ( see cd31 for a description of this process ) the antigen presentation on the surface of infected macrophages ( in the context of mhc class ii ) in a lymph node stimulates th1 ( type 1 helper t cells ) to proliferate ( mainly due to il-12 secretion from the macrophage ) t cells that express the t cell receptor which recognizes the antigen-mhcii complex ( with co-stimulatory factors- cd40 and cd40l ) cause the b-cell to produce antibodies that help opsonisation of the antigen so that the bacteria can be better cleared by phagocytes after digesting a pathogen , a macrophage will present the antigen ( a molecule , most often a protein found on the surface of the pathogen and used by the immune system for identification ) of the pathogen to the corresponding helper t cell the removal of dying cells is , to a greater extent , handled by fixed macrophages , which will stay at strategic locations such as the lungs , liver , neural tissue , bone , spleen and connective tissue , ingesting foreign materials such as pathogens and recruiting additional macrophages if needed m1 macrophages are the dominating phenotype observed in the early stages of inflammation and are activated by four key mediators : interferon-γ ( ifn-γ ) , tumor necrosis factor ( tnf ) , and damage associated molecular patterns ( damps ) m1 macrophages : as mentioned earlier ( previously referred to as classically activated macrophages ) , m1 '' killer '' macrophages are activated by lps and ifn-gamma , and secrete high levels of il-12 and low levels of il-10 macrophages are stimulated by the low oxygen content of their surroundings to produce factors that induce and speed angiogenesis and they also stimulate cells that re-epithelialize the wound , create granulation tissue , and lay down a new extracellular matrix eventually , the antigen presentation results in the production of antibody that attach to the antigens of pathogens , making them easier for macrophages to adhere to with their cell membrane and phagocytose m2 & nbsp ; macrophages can remove cholesterol from blood vessels , but when the cholesterol is oxidized , the m2 & nbsp ; macrophages become apoptosis foam cells contributing to the atheroma of atherosclerosis in order to minimize the possibility of becoming the host of an intracellular bacteria , macrophages have evolved defense mechanisms such as induction of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen intermediates , which are toxic to microbes for example , macrophages may have cytotoxic activity to kill tumor cells directly ; also the co-operation of t-cells and macrophages is important to suppress tumors the presentation is done by integrating it into the cell membrane and displaying it attached to an mhc class ii molecule ( mhcii ) , indicating to other white blood cells that the macrophage is not a pathogen , despite having antigens on its surface within the fat ( adipose ) tissue of ccr2 deficient mice , there is an increased number of eosinophils , greater alternative macrophage activation , and a propensity towards type 2 cytokine expression for example , they participate in the formation of granulomas , inflammatory lesions that may be caused by a large number of diseases when at the site , the first wave of neutrophils , after the process of aging and after the first 48 hours , stimulate the appearance of the macrophages whereby these macrophages will then ingest the aged neutrophils it is thought that macrophages release soluble substances that influence the proliferation , differentiation , growth , repair , and regeneration of muscle , but at this time the factor that is produced to mediate these effects is unknown moreover , macrophages serve as a source for many pro-angiogenic factors including vascular endothelial factor ( vegf ) , tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( tnf-alpha ) , macrophage colony-stimulating factor and il-1 and il-6 contributing further to the tumor growth infection of macrophages in joints is associated with local inflammation during and after the acute phase of chikungunya ( caused by chikv or chikungunya virus ) melanophages are a subset of tissue-resident macrophages able to absorb pigment , either native to the organism or exogenous ( such as tattoos ) , from extracellular space there has yet to be a determined mechanism for the alteration of the intestinal macrophages by recruitment of new monocytes or changes in the already present intestinal macrophages because macrophages can regulate tumor progression , therapeutic strategies to reduce the number of these cells , or to manipulate their phenotypes , are currently being tested in cancer patients in cases where systemic iron levels are raised , or where inflammation is present , raised levels of hepcidin act on macrophage ferroportin channels , leading to iron remaining within the macrophages this co-operation involves not only the direct contact of t-cell and macrophage , with antigen presentation , but also includes the secretion of adequate combinations of cytokines , which enhance t-cell antitumor activity the initial wave is a phagocytic population that comes along during periods of increased muscle use that are sufficient to cause muscle membrane lysis and membrane inflammation , which can enter and degrade the contents of injured muscle fibers however , macrophages are also involved in antibody mediated cytotoxicity ( adcc ) and this mechanism has been proposed to be important for certain cancer immunotherapy antibodies though very similar in structure to tissue macrophages , intestinal macrophages have evolved specific characteristics and functions given their natural environment , which is in the digestive tract intestinal macrophages have been shown to play a role in inflammatory bowel disease ( ibd ) , such as crohn 's disease ( cd ) and ulcerative colitis ( uc ) like macrophages , intestinal macrophages are differentiated monocytes , though intestinal macrophages have to coexist with the microbiota in the intestines along with dendritic cells , they are foremost among the cells that present antigens , a crucial role in initiating an immune response however , dysregulation occurs as the m1 macrophages are unable/do not phagocytose neutrophils that have undergone apoptosis leading to increased macrophage migration and inflammation these resident macrophages are sessile ( non-migratory ) , provide essential growth factors to support the physiological function of the tissue ( e.g the neutrophils are at first attracted to a site , where they perform their function and die , before they are phagocytized by the macrophages some tumors can also produce factors , including m-csf/csf1 , ccl2 and angiotensin ii , that trigger the amplification and mobilization of macrophages in tumors in a healthy gut , intestinal macrophages limit the inflammatory response in the gut , but in a disease-state , intestinal macrophage numbers and diversity are altered
