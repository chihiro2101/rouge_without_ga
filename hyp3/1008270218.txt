the nature and meaning of individual gestures varies between groups , but a widely adopted core set of hand signals include : wiggling of the fingers on both hands , a gesture sometimes referred to as '' twinkling '' , to indicate agreement ; raising a fist or crossing both forearms with hands in fists to indicate a block or strong disagreement ; and making a '' t '' shape with both hands , the '' time out '' gesture , to call attention to a point of process or order in consensus is not unanimity , consensus practitioner and activist leader starhawk wrote : confusion between unanimity and consensus , in other words , usually causes consensus decision-making to fail , and the group then either reverts to majority or supermajority rule or disbands in the quaker model , as with other consensus decision-making processes , articulating the emerging consensus allows members to be clear on the decision in front of them the common roles in a consensus meeting are : facilitator : as the name implies , the role of the facilitator is to help make the process of reaching a consensus decision easier critics of consensus blocking often observe that the option , while potentially effective for small groups of motivated or trained individuals with a sufficiently high degree of affinity , has a number of possible shortcomings , notably preservation of the status quo : in decision-making bodies that use formal consensus , the ability of individuals or small minorities to block agreement gives an enormous advantage to anyone who supports the existing state of affairs although the name and nature of these roles varies from group to group , the most common are the facilitator , consensor , a timekeeper , an empath and a secretary or notes taker the lack of legitimate consensus process in the unanimous conviction of jesus by corrupt priests in an illegally held sanhedrin court ( which had rules preventing unanimous conviction in a hurried process ) strongly influenced the views of pacifist protestants , including the anabaptists ( mennonites/amish ) , quakers and shakers in this method each member of the group can hold up a fist to indicate blocking consensus , one finger to suggest changes , two fingers to discuss minor issues , three fingers to indicate willingness to let issue pass without further discussion , four fingers to affirm the decision as a good idea , and five fingers to volunteer to take a lead in implementing the decision a type of unanimous consent , the liberum veto originally allowed any member of a sejm to veto an individual law by shouting sisto activitatem ! ( latin : '' i stop the activity ! '' ) or nie pozwalam ! ( polish : '' i do not allow ! '' ) facilitators accept responsibility for moving through the agenda on time ; ensuring the group adheres to the mutually agreed-upon mechanics of the consensus process ; and , if necessary , suggesting alternate or additional discussion or decision-making techniques , such as go-arounds , break-out groups or role-playing in aceh and nias cultures ( indonesian ) , family and regional disputes , from playground fights to estate inheritance , are handled through a musyawarah consensus-building process in which parties mediate to find peace and avoid future hostility and revenge the united states bureau of land management 's policy is to seek to use collaborative stakeholder engagement as standard operating practice for natural resources projects , plans , and decision-making except under unusual conditions such as when constrained by law , regulation , or other mandates or when conventional processes are important for establishing new , or reaffirming existing , precedent although stand asides do not halt a motion , it is often regarded as a strong '' nay vote '' and the concerns of group members standing aside are usually addressed by modifications to the proposal when there is potential for a block to a group decision , both the group and dissenters in the group are encouraged to collaborate until agreement can be reached consensor : the team of consensors is responsible for accepting those relevant proposals which conform with the un charter on human rights ; for displaying an initial list of these options ; for drawing up a balanced list of options to represent the entire debate ; to analyse the preferences cast in any subsequent mbc ballot ; and , if need be , to determine the composite decision from the two most popular options they may be symptoms of a systemic bias , a rigged process ( where an agenda is not published in advance or changed when it becomes clear who is present to consent ) , fear of speaking one 's mind , a lack of creativity ( to suggest alternatives ) or even a lack of courage ( to go further along the same road to a more extreme solution that would not achieve unanimous consent ) '' one tradition in support of rough consensus is the tradition of humming rather than ( countable ) hand-raising ; this allows a group to quickly discern the prevalence of dissent , without making it easy to slip into majority rule studies of effective consensus process usually indicate a shunning of unanimity or '' illusion of unanimity '' that does not hold up as a group comes under real-world pressure ( when dissent reappears ) additionally , opponents of majority rule claim that it can lead to a '' tyranny of the majority '' , a scenario in which a majority places its interests so far above those of an individual or minority group as to constitute active oppression the facilitator ( '' clerk '' or '' convenor '' in the quaker model ) identifies areas of agreement and names disagreements to push discussion deeper additionally , the time commitment required to engage in the consensus decision-making process can sometimes act as a barrier to participation for individuals unable or unwilling to make the commitment each member of the group usually must actively state whether they agree or consent , stand aside , or object , often by using a hand gesture or raising a colored card , to avoid the group warnock 's dilemma consensus-building and direct democracy experimentation was a feature of voter registration projects by the student nonviolent coordinating committee ( sncc ) in the american south ; the economic research and action project ( erap ) of students for a democratic society ( mid-1960s ) , some women 's liberation groups ( late 1960s to early 1970s ) and anti-nuclear and peace movement groups ( late 1970s and early 1980s ) to ensure the agreement or consent of all participants is valued , many groups choose unanimity or near-unanimity as their decision rule characteristics of consensus decision-making include : collaboration : participants contribute to a shared proposal and shape it into a decision that meets the concerns of all group members as much as possible should some dissenter 's perspective not harmonize with the others , that dissenter may '' stand aside '' to allow the group to proceed , or may opt to '' block '' in the xulu and xhosa ( south african ) process of indaba , community leaders gather to listen to the public and negotiate red line ( phrase ) towards an acceptable compromise '' instead , a working group ( wg ) chair or bof chair is supposed to articulate the '' sense of the group furthermore , '' opposing such obstructive behavior can be construed as an attack on freedom of speech and in turn harden resolve on the part of the individual to defend his or her position empath or vibe watch : the empath , or 'vibe watch ' as the position is sometimes called , is charged with monitoring the 'emotional climate ' of the meeting , taking note of the body language and other non-verbal cues of the participants the facilitator articulates the sense of the discussion , asks if there are other concerns , and proposes a '' minute '' of the decision consensus voting , in contrast , the modified borda count , mbc , can identify the consensus of any electorate , whenever such a consensus exists defusing potential emotional conflicts , maintaining a climate free of intimidation and being aware of potentially destructive power dynamics , such as sexism or racism within the decision-making body , are the primary responsibilities of the empath another method to promote agreement is to use a voting process under which all members of the group have a strategic incentive to agree rather than block '' consensus in supreme court voting , particularly the extreme consensus of unanimity , has often puzzled court observers who adhere to ideological accounts of judicial decision making the referees decide which option , or which composite of the two leading options , is the outcome in the abilene paradox , a group can unanimously agree on a course of action that no individual member of the group desires because no one individual is willing to go against the perceived will of the decision-making body some decision-making bodies rotate these roles through the group members in order to build the experience and skills of the participants , and prevent any perceived concentration of power the basic model for achieving consensus as defined by any decision rule involves : collaboratively generating a proposal identifying unsatisfied concerns modifying the proposal to generate as much agreement as possible all attempts at achieving consensus begin with a good faith attempt at generating full-agreement , regardless of decision rule threshold cooperation : participants in an effective consensus process should strive to reach the best possible decision for the group and all of its members , rather than competing for personal preferences formation of a proposal : based on the discussion a formal decision proposal on the issue is presented to the group
