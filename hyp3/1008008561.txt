inuit hero 'nanook ' from the silent documentary film nanook of the north ( 1922 ) wearing whale bone snow-goggles retrieved december 5 , 2014 in many different forms and with many different materials , the indigenous peoples of north america and northern asia crafted highly efficient equipment to protect their eyes against the damaging effects of strong sunlight in snowy circumstances sunglasses made from flat panes of smoky quartz , which offered no corrective powers but did protect the eyes from glare , were used in china in the 12th century or possibly earlier yellow/amber and brown-tinted spectacles were also a commonly prescribed item for people with syphilis in the 19th and early 20th centuries because sensitivity to light was one of the symptoms of the disease '' it stated that 20 million sunglasses were sold in the united states in 1937 , but estimated that only about 25 % of american wearers needed them to protect their eyes the most widespread protection is against ultraviolet radiation , which can cause short-term and long-term ocular problems such as arc eye , snow blindness , cataracts , pterygium , and various forms of eye cancer medical experts advise the public on the importance of wearing sunglasses to protect the eyes from uv ; for adequate protection , experts recommend sunglasses that reflect or filter out 99 % or more of uva and uvb light , with wavelengths up to 400 nm this is slightly more protection than the widely used standard of the european union ( see below ) , which requires that 95 % of the radiation up to only 380 & nbsp ; nm must be reflected or filtered out more recently , high-energy visible light ( hev ) has been implicated as a cause of age-related macular degeneration ; before , debates had already existed as to whether '' blue blocking '' or amber tinted lenses may have a protective effect some manufacturers already design glasses to block blue light ; the insurance company suva , which covers most swiss employees , asked eye experts around charlotte remé ( eth zürich ) to develop norms for blue blocking , leading to a recommended minimum of 95 % of the blue light article by charlotte remé , who also developed the guidelines/norms for switzerland : sunglasses are especially important for children , as their ocular lenses are thought to transmit far more hev light than adults ( lenses '' yellow '' with age ) the only way to assess the protection of sunglasses is to have the lenses measured , either by the manufacturer or by a properly equipped optician several standards for sunglasses ( see below ) allow a general classification of the uv protection ( but not the blue light protection ) , and manufacturers often indicate simply that the sunglasses meet the requirements of a specific standard rather than publish the exact figures the lenses should fit close enough to the face that only very little '' stray light '' can reach the eye from their sides , or from above or below , but not so close that the eyelashes smear the lenses inadequate dark lenses are even more harmful than inadequate light lenses ( or wearing no sunglasses at all ) because they provoke the pupil to open wider regarding blue light , the color gives at least a first indication : blue blocking lenses are commonly yellow or brown , whereas blue or gray lenses can not offer the necessary blue light protection while non-tinted glasses are very rarely worn without the practical purpose of correcting eyesight or protecting one 's eyes , sunglasses have become popular for several further reasons , and are sometimes worn even indoors or at night they can make eye contact impossible , which can be intimidating to those not wearing sunglasses ; the avoided eye contact can also demonstrate the wearer 's detachment , which is considered desirable ( or '' cool '' ) in some circles in all cases , hiding one 's eyes has implications for nonverbal communication ; this is useful in poker , and many professional poker players wear heavily tinted glasses indoors while playing , so that it is more difficult for opponents to read tells which involve eye movement and thus gain an advantage the relevance of sunglasses within the fashion industry has included prominent fashion editors ' reviews of annual trends in sunglasses as well as runway fashion shows featuring sunglasses as a primary or secondary component of a look fashion trends can also draw on the '' cool '' image of sunglasses and association with a particular lifestyle , especially the close connection between sunglasses and beach life the assumption is that it may be more comfortable for another person not to see the hidden eyes rather than see abnormal eyes or eyes which seem to look in the wrong direction people may also wear sunglasses to hide dilated or contracted pupils , bloodshot eyes due to drug use , chronic dark circles or crow 's feet , recent physical abuse ( such as a black eye ) , exophthalmos ( bulging eyes ) , a cataract , or eyes which jerk uncontrollably ( nystagmus ) 4 of 2005 ) , retrieved 6 april 2017 the five ratings for transmittance ( filter ) under this standard are based on the amount of absorbed light , 0 to 4 , with '' 0 '' providing some protection from uv radiation and sunglare , and '' 4 '' indicating a high level of protection , but not to be worn when driving the european standard en 1836:2005 has four transmittance ratings : '' 0 '' for insufficient uv protection , '' 2 '' for sufficient uhv protection , '' 6 '' for good uhv protection and '' 7 '' for '' full '' uhvv protection , meaning that no more than 5 % of the 380 & nbsp ; nm rays are transmitted there is no european rating for transmittance protection for radiation of up to 400 & nbsp ; nm ( '' uv400 '' ) , as required in other countries ( incl the current european standard , en 1836:2005 , was preceded by the older standards en 166:1995 ( personal eye protection – specifications ) , en167 : 1995 ( personal eye protection – optical test methods ) , and en168 : 1995 ( personal eye protection – non-optical test methods ) , which in 2002 were republished as a revised standard under the name of en 1836:1997 ( which included two amendments ) in addition to filtering , the standard also lists requirements for minimum robustness , labeling , materials ( non-toxic for skin contact and not combustible ) and lack of protrusions ( to avoid harm when wearing them ) categories for the european standard , which are required to be marked on the frame : category 0 – 80 % -100 % transmission – for fashion , indoor use , or cloudy days category 1 – 43 % -80 % transmission – low sun exposure category 2 – 18 % -43 % transmission – medium sun exposure category 3 – 8 % -18 % transmission – strong brightness , light reflected of water or snow category 4 – 3 % -8 % transmission – intense sunshine for high mountains , glaciers ; not for use when driving or on the road according to this standard , the lens should have a uvb ( 280 to 315 & nbsp ; nm ) transmittance of no more than one per cent and a uva ( 315 to 380 & nbsp ; nm ) transmittance of no more than 0.3 times the visual light transmittance in the basic impact test , a 1 in ( 2.54 & nbsp ;

'' , retrieved 6 april 2017 slowing and limiting the reaction of the lenses and making them unsuitable for driving as they could become too dark or too light for the conditions lenses with light transmission less than 75 % are unsuitable for night driving , and lenses with light transmission less than 8 % ( category 4 ) are unsuitable for driving at any time ; they should by uk law be labelled 'not suitable for driving and road use ' even though some of these glasses are proven good enough for driving at night , it is strongly recommended not to do so , due to the changes in a wide variety of light intensities , especially while using yellow tinted protection glasses polarised glasses are undesirable as aircraft windscreens are often polarised , intentionally or unintentionally , showing moiré patterns on looking through the windscreen ; and some lcds used by instruments emit polarised light , and can dim or disappear when the pilot turns to look at them they need shatterproof and impact-resistant lenses ; a strap or other fixing is typically used to keep glasses in place during sporting activities , and they have a nose cushion for water sports , so-called water sunglasses ( also : surf goggles or water eyewear ) are specially adapted for use in turbulent water , such as the surf or whitewater in addition to the features for sports glasses , water sunglasses can have increased buoyancy to stop them from sinking should they come off , and they can have a vent or other method to eliminate fogging mountain climbing or traveling across glaciers or snowfields requires above-average eye protection , because sunlight ( including ultraviolet radiation ) is more intense in higher altitudes , and snow and ice reflect additional light they typically have very dark round lenses and leather blinders at the sides , which protect the eyes by blocking the sun 's rays around the edges of the lenses special shaded visors were once allowed in american football ; jim mcmahon , quarterback for the chicago bears and san diego chargers , famously used a sun visor during his professional football career due to a childhood eye injury and almost always wears dark sunglasses when not wearing a football helmet reliable fit is particularly important when wearing corrective glasses underneath tight helmets and in space suits : once inside the spacesuit , slipped glasses can not be touched to push them back into place , sometimes for up to ten hours frames and glasses must be designed so that small pieces of the glasses such as screws and glass particles can not become dislodged , then float and be inhaled while some blue blocking sunglasses ( see above ) are produced as regular sunglasses for exposure to bright sunlight , others—especially for macular degeneration patients—do not block light or other colors in order to function well in regular daylight and even dim sunlight amber or yellow , are sometimes recommended to treat insomnia ; they are worn in artificial lighting after dark , to reestablish the circadian rhythm and treat delayed sleep phase disorder some models have polarized lenses , made of polaroid polarized plastic sheeting , to reduce glare caused by light reflected from non-metallic surfaces such as water ( see brewster 's angle for how this works ) as well as by polarized diffuse sky radiation ( skylight ) this mirrored coating deflects some of the light when it hits the lens so that it is not transmitted through the lens , making it useful in bright conditions ; however , it does not necessarily reflect uv radiation as well any of the above features , color , polarization , gradation , mirroring , and materials , can be combined into the lens for a pair of sunglasses an alternative is to use the corrective glasses with a secondary lenses such as oversize sunglasses that fit over the regular glasses , clip-on lens that are placed in front of the glasses , and flip-up glasses which feature a dark lens that can be flipped up when not in use ( see below ) there are two styles of frameless glasses : those that have a piece of frame material connecting the two lenses , and those that are a single lens with ear stems on each side the reasons are that the cost of a set of lenses is less than the cost of a separate pair of glasses , and carrying extra lenses is less bulky than carrying multiple pairs of glasses a traditional , conservative style based on mid-20th century design , browlines were adapted into sunglasses form in the 1980s and rapidly became one of the most popular styles ; it has ebbed and sprung in popularity in the decades that have followed analogous to inuit goggles ( see above ) , the principle is not to filter light , but to decrease the amount of sun rays falling into the wearer 's eyes to provide uv protection , shutter shades sometimes use lenses in addition to the shutters ; if not , they provide very insufficient protection against ultraviolet radiation and blue light '' teashades '' was also used to describe glasses worn to hide the effects of recreational drugs such as marijuana ( conjunctival injection ) or heroin ( pupillary constriction ) or just bloodshot eyes these were mostly popular in the late 1950s and during the 1960s ( being linked to the rock-and-roll/blues and mod cultures ) , before plastic glasses were displaced by metallic rims popular among the counter-culture in the late 1970s , the rise of new wave music , new romanticism and the popularity of the blues brothers aside from 50s and 1960s nostalgia and the anti-disco backlash later on brought the model out of near-retirement , becoming the most sold model between 1980 and 1999 aided by a lucrative 1982 product placement deal , which put it on many movies and tv shows such as the breakfast club and moonlighting 1980s nostalgia and the influence of the hipster subculture and the television series mad men boosted wayfarers once again after a slump in the 1990s and 2000s , also aided by a 2000 redesign ( new wayfarer ) , surpassing aviators since 2012 they may have a single curved semi-circular lens that covers both eyes and much of the same area of the face covered by protective goggles , usually with a minimal plastic frame and single piece of plastic serving as a nosepiece thumb clip-on glasses are a form of tinted glasses that can be clipped on to eyeglasses for protection from the sun glints is a term for glasses originating from the '' glint '' that is noticeable when somebody wearing glasses moves their head
