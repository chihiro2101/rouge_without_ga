larger aircraft would have to be longer , higher ( such as a double-deck ) , or wider in order to accommodate a greater number of passenger seats by adding a second aisle , the wider aircraft could accommodate as many as 10 seats across , but could also be easily converted to a freighter and carry two eight-by-eight freight pallets abreast the engineers also opted for creating '' stretched '' versions of the dc-8 ( 61 , 62 and 63 models ) , as well as longer versions of boeing 's 707 ( -320b and 320c models ) and 727 ( -200 model ) ; and douglas ' dc-9 ( -30 , -40 , and -50 models ) , all of which were capable of accommodating more seats than their shorter predecessor versions after the success of the early wide-body aircraft , several subsequent designs came to market over the next two decades , including the boeing 767 and 777 , the airbus a330 and a340 , and the mcdonnell douglas md-11 in the '' jumbo '' category , the capacity of the boeing 747 was not surpassed until october 2007 , when the airbus a380 entered commercial service with the nickname '' superjumbo '' both the boeing 747 and airbus a380 '' jumbo jets '' have four engines each ( quad-jets ) , but the upcoming boeing 777x ( '' mini jumbo jet '' ) is a twinjet the production of the large boeing 747-8 and airbus a380 four-engine , long-haul jets is being cut back as airlines are now preferring the smaller , more efficient a350 , 787 and 777 twin-engine , long-range airliners although wide-body aircraft have larger frontal areas ( and thus greater form drag ) than narrow-body aircraft of similar capacity , they have several advantages over their narrow-body counterparts , such as : a larger cabin space for passengers , giving a more open feeling a lower ratio of surface area to volume , and thus lower drag per passenger or cargo volume twin aisles that accelerate loading , unloading , and evacuation compared to a single aisle ( wide-body airliners typically have 3.5 to 5 seats abreast per aisle , compared to 5â€“6 on most narrow-body aircraft ) reduced overall aircraft length for a given capacity , improving ground manoeuvrability and reducing the risk of tailstrike greater under-floor freight capacity better structural efficiency for larger aircraft than would be possible with a narrow-body design british and russian designers had proposed wide-body aircraft similar in configuration to the vickers vc10 and douglas dc-9 , but with a wide-body fuselage the british three-eleven project never left the drawing board , while the russian il-86 wide-body proposal eventually gave way to a more conventional wing-mounted engine design , most likely due to the inefficiencies of mounting such large engines on the aft fuselage the interiors of aircraft , known as the aircraft cabin , have been undergoing evolution since the first passenger aircraft in some of the largest single-deck wide-body aircraft , such as the boeing 777 , the extra space above the cabin is used for crew rest areas and galley storage due to their weight , all current wide-body aircraft are categorized as '' heavy '' , or in the case of the a380 in u.s in some countries , such as the united states , it is a requirement to suffix the aircraft 's call sign with the word heavy ( or super ) when communicating with air traffic control in certain areas some wide-body aircraft are used as flying command posts by the military like the ilyushin il-80 or the boeing e-4 , while the boeing e-767 is used for airborne early warning and control
