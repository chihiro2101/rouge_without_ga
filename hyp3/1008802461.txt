the swedish naturalist and arachnologist carl jakob sundevall ( 1801–1875 ) honored the naturalist martin lister ( 1638–1712 ) by adopting lister 's term opiliones for this order , known in lister 's days as '' harvest spiders '' or '' shepherd spiders '' , from latin opilio , '' shepherd '' ; lister characterized three species from england ( although not formally describing them , being a pre-linnean work ) an urban legend claims that the harvestman is the most venomous animal in the world , but possesses fangs too short or a mouth too round and small to bite a human , rendering it harmless ( the same myth applies to pholcus phalangioides and the cranefly , which are both also called a '' daddy longlegs '' ) 4-eyed daddy longlegs helps explain arachnid evolution however , some species are eyeless , such as the brazilian caecobunus termitarum ( grassatores ) from termite nests , giupponia chagasi ( gonyleptidae ) from caves , most species of cyphophthalmi , and all species of the guasiniidae the most easily discernible difference between harvestmen and spiders is that in harvestmen , the connection between the cephalothorax and abdomen is broad , so that the body appears to be a single oval structure carl friedrich roewer described about a third ( 2,260 ) of today 's known species from the 1910s to the 1950s , and published the landmark systematic work die weberknechte der erde ( harvestmen of the world ) in 1923 , with descriptions of all species known to that time most species are nocturnal and colored in hues of brown , although a number of diurnal species are known , some of which have vivid patterns in yellow , green , and black with varied reddish and blackish mottling and reticulation multiple species within the laniatores and dyspnoi possess stridulation organs , which are used as animal communication and have also been shown to be used as a second line of defense when restrained by a predator suborder cyphophthalmi simon 1879 (

in the phalangioidea despite being similar in appearance to , and often confused with , spiders , they are probably closely related to the scorpions , pseudoscorpions , and solifuges ; these four orders form the clade dromopoda texella cokendolpheri from a cave in central texas and calicina minor , microcina edgewoodensis , microcina homi , microcina jungi , microcina leei , microcina lumi , and microcina tiburona from around springs and other restricted habitats of central california are being considered for listing as endangered species , but as yet receive no protection as in all arachnida , the body in the opiliones has two tagmata , the anterior cephalothorax or prosoma , and the posterior 10-segmented abdomen or opisthosoma typical body length does not exceed , and some species are smaller than 1 & nbsp ; mm , although the largest known species , trogulus torosus ( trogulidae ) , grows as long as these include pachyloidellus fulvigranulatus , which is found only on top of cerro uritorco , the highest peak in the sierras chicas chain ( provincia de cordoba ) and pachyloides borellii is in rainforest patches in northwest argentina which are in an area being dramatically destroyed by humans the oldest known harvestman , from the 410-million-year-old devonian rhynie chert , displayed almost all the characteristics of modern species , placing the origin of harvestmen in the silurian , or even earlier a unique feature of harvestmen is that some species practice parental care , in which the male is solely responsible for guarding the eggs resulting from multiple partners , often against egg-eating females , and cleaning the eggs regularly most opiliones , except for cyphophthalmi , have a single pair of eyes in the middle of the head , oriented

mazon creek , u.s indeed , one species discovered in china , mesobunus martensi , fossilized by fine-grained volcanic ash around 165 million years ago , is hardly discernible from modern-day harvestmen and has been placed in the extant family sclerosomatidae thanatosis is used as a second line of defense when detected by a potential predator and is commonly observed within the dyspnoi and laniatores suborders , with individuals becoming rigid with legs either retracted or stretched this can be a deceiving mechanism to avoid predation when they are in a large aggregation of individuals , which are all trembling at the same time in some highly derived species , the first five abdominal segments are fused into a dorsal shield called the scute , which in most such species is fused with the carapace none of the known species of harvestmen has venom glands ; their chelicerae are not hollowed fangs but grasping claws that are typically very small and not strong enough to break human skin no fossils of the cyphophthalmi or laniatores much older than 50 million years are known , despite the former presenting a basal clade , and the latter having probably diverged from the dyspnoi more than 300 mya the legs continue to twitch after they are detached because 'pacemakers ' are located in the ends of the first long segment ( femur ) of their legs cellar spiders ( pholcidae ) that are commonly mistaken for daddy long-legs ( opiliones ) also exhibit this behavior when their webs are disturbed or even during courtship four species of opiliones are on the brazilian national list of endangered species , all of them cave-dwelling : giupponia chagasi , iandumoema uai , pachylospeleus strinatii and spaeleoleptes spaeleus this strategy can be costly because harvestmen do not regenerate their legs , and leg loss reduces locomotion , speed , climbing ability , sensory perception , food detection , and territoriality fossils from the devonian rhynie chert , 410 million years ago , already show characteristics like tracheae and sexual organs , indicating that the group has lived on land since that time trogulus longipes haupt , 1956 ( dyspnoi : trogulidae ) — geiseltal ,
