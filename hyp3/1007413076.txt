in duke 's road , euston , the donmar warehouse in covent garden , the barbican theatre and the pit at the barbican centre in the city of london the critic michael billington , summarising these events , wrote : '' in 1960 the twenty-nine-year-old peter hall formally took charge at stratford-upon-avon and set about turning a star-laden , six-month shakespeare festival into a monumental , year-round operation built around a permanent company , a london base and contemporary work from home and abroad to provide balance , simon trowbridge in a royal shakespeare company book , published in 2017 , is highly critical of aspects of the boyd years , including his decision to redevelop the royal shakespeare theatre as a second swan theatre following a deal with prince littler , managing director of associated theatre properties , the rsc established the aldwych theatre as its london base for productions transferred from stratford to london , its stage redesigned to match the rst 's apron stage there have also been seasons at the mermaid theatre , the almeida theatre ( 1988 and 1989 ) , the roundhouse in camden , the young vic , the playhouse theatre , the novello theatre and the gielgud theatre the rsc was formally established on 20 march 1961 with the royal announcement that the shakespeare memorial theatre would henceforth be known as the royal shakespeare theatre and the company as the royal shakespeare company in 1962 , strong opposition to the establishment of a london base for the rsc came from the royal national theatre which – led by viscount chandos and laurence olivier – wished to be the sole subsidised company operating in london at the insistence of sir trevor nunn ( who had taken over as artistic director in 1968 ) , the company hired the place off the euston road in london and constructed its own theatre space for an audience of 330 , seated on raked wooden benches there have been theatrical performances in stratford-upon-avon since at least shakespeare 's day , though the first recorded performance of a play written by shakespeare himself was in 1746 when parson joseph greene , master of stratford grammar school , organised a charitable production to fund the restoration of shakespeare 's funerary monument at the royal shakespeare theatre , terry hands and actor alan howard had a marathon year working on henry v , a virtually uncut , henry vi , part 1 , henry vi , part 2 and henry vi , part 3 and coriolanus twenty years later , in the summer of 1982 , the company took up london residence in both the barbican theatre and the pit studio space in the barbican centre under the auspices of the city of london addenbrooke ( 1974 ) on 14 january 1960 , hall 's first policy statement as director also proposed the acquisition of a second theatre , in london , to be used as a city outlet for selected stratford productions the theatre was launched on 8 may 1986 with a production of the two noble kinsmen by william shakespeare and john fletcher ( not published until 1634 and thought to be shakespeare 's last work for the stage ) later it came under the direction of sir barry jackson in 1945 , state of the nation : british theatre since 1945 by michael billington , faber ( 2007 ) anthony quayle from 1948 to 1956 and glen byam shaw 1957–1959 , with an impressive roll-call of actors hands took the decision to suspend the rsc 's residency at the barbican theatre and the pit during the winter season of 1990–91 , thus vacating the capital for the first time in 30 years the project began with shakespeare 's richard ii , starring david tennant , in november 2013 , and followed up with henry iv parts 1 and 2 and the two gentlemen of verona in 2014 nunn ( who had been appointed to follow hall 's tenure at the national theatre in 1968 ) ceded his rsc executive directorship in 1986 to his co-artistic director terry hands , who bore the brunt of media hostility during a difficult few years for the company live from stratford-upon-avon , a new project to broadcast the company 's productions in cinemas around the world and stream them into schools was announced in may 2013 rsc the histories cycle talking of these achievements with typical modesty he told the evening standard in december 2007 ( 'the man who remade the rsc ' ) : '' there was a bit of gardening to do , but we are now beginning to show signs of walking the walk in march 2008 , the rsc launched a manifesto 'stand up for shakespeare ' , a campaign to promote a positive experience of shakespeare for children and young people
