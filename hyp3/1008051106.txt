larceny laws in the united states have their roots in common law , pursuant to which larceny involves the trespassory taking ( caption ) and carrying away ( asportation , removal ) of the tangible personal property of another with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of its possession punishment for larceny whilst section 117 of the new south wales crimes act ( 1900 ) specifies the punishment for larceny , it is silent on the elements of the offence , leaving them to be articulated by the common law furthermore , it has two elements which must be met : the actual taking of the property , even if momentarily ( actus reus ) , and the culpable intent to deprive another of their property ( mens rea ) theft act ( northern ireland ) 1969 ( c.16 ) , section 30 it has been replaced by the broader offence of theft under section 1 ( 1 ) of the theft act ( northern ireland ) 1969 for example , north carolina general statutes section 14 - 72 ( b ) ( 1 ) makes the crime of larceny a felony '' without regard to value '' if the larceny is ( 1 ) from the person ( 2 ) committed pursuant to certain types of breaking or enterings ( 3 ) of any explosive or incendiary device or ( 4 ) of any firearm to say that the taking was not trespassory is to say that the person ( s ) performing the embezzlement had the right to possess , use , and/or access the assets in question , and that such person ( s ) subsequently secreted and converted the assets for an unintended and/or unsanctioned use for example , if a person stole the coca-cola formula , the crime would be larceny but the grade of the offense would be determined by the value of the paper on which the formula was recorded not the value of the recipe ( lexis 2001 ) a person has possession of property when he has actual physical control over the property ( actual possession ) or he has the right to exercise considerable control over the disposition or use of the property ( constructive possession ) the common law offence of larceny was abolished the criminal justice ( theft and fraud offences ) act 2001 ( no.50 ) , section 3 ( 2 ) irishstatutebook.ie on 1 august 2002 acts of common law larceny can not be committed against intangible things , such as love or affection , identity ( identity theft is a type of fraud ) , or intellectual property , such as information and ideas if a person picks up a package of steaks intending to steal them then changes her or his mind and puts the steak back in the meat counter , the crime of larceny has been committed but the state will have a difficult time proving it however , as perkins notes , the purpose of the statute was not to create a new offense but was merely to confirm that the acts described in the statute met the elements of common law larceny it has corporeal presence and it can be moved around as witnessed by the fact that the technician picked it up at the warehouse , loaded it into his truck , drove it to the house , unloaded it , placed it in the basement and hooked it up to the house the common law offence of larceny was abolished theft act ( northern ireland ) 1969 ( c.16 ) ( n.i in the state of new south wales , the common law offence of larceny is punishable with up to 5 years ' imprisonment under many states ' larceny statutes , including california , larceny can include the taking of '' money , labor , or real or personal property this limitation existed because larceny 's original purpose was to punish breaches of peace rather than violations of property interests under the common law , it was not sufficient if the offender simply deprived the victim of possession ; the offender must have gained control over the property however , if the person disconnected the air conditioner , left the premises to find someone to help him move the unit , returned and loaded the unit on his truck and left , the crime would be larceny theft act 1968 ( c.60 ) , section 32 it has been replaced by the broader offence of theft under section 1 ( 1 ) of the theft act 1968 it was abolished the theft act 1968 ( c.60 ) , section 32 ( 1 ) ( a ) legislation.gov.uk on 1 january 1969 , the theft act 1968 ( c.60 ) , section 35 ( 1 ) legislation.gov.uk for all purposes not relating to offences committed before that date the subject matter of larceny has been tangible personal property , for example , one can steal a person 's social security card and use the information to obtain a credit card and make transactions if a third party transfers possession of property to an employee for delivery to his employer , the employee has possession of the property and his conversion of the property would be embezzlement rather than larceny the chief impediment to conviction was the doctrine of possessorial immunity which said that a person who had acquired possession lawfully , that is with the consent of the owner , could not be prosecuted for larceny however , officers , managers and employees who have significant authority over the disposition or use of the employer 's property have possession rather than custody and the misappropriation of the property would likely be embezzlement rather than larceny 573 , 58 p.2d 523 ( 1936 ) however , it is not a defense that the defendant did not know that the property belonged to the true owner , only that he knew that it did not belong to him the court held that the defendant 's acts did not satisfy the asportation element of larceny because the movement of the wheelbarrow had merely been preparatory to the carrying away examples of custody would be a store customer examining the goods of a merchant , or an employee who has been given the property of his employer to be used in his employment however , once the teller transfers possession of the money to his employer , by placing the money in the till for example , the subsequent taking would be larceny rather than embezzlement a person who takes property of another under the mistaken belief that the property belongs to him does not have the requisite intent to steal ; nor does a person '' intend to steal '' property when he takes property intending to make temporary use of it and then return the property to the owner within a reasonable time larceny involves the trespassory taking of property from possession of another , with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of that property they reasoned , therefore , that asportation was an irrelevant requirement because in modern criminal law , like the model penal code , ยง5.01 the sentencing consequences between an attempted and completed crime are negligible however , the common law stated that if the severance and carrying away of a fixture were one continuous act , no larceny would occur it is important to make clear that embezzlement is not always a form of theft or an act of stealing , since those definitions specifically deal with taking something that does not belong to the perpetrator ( s ) the offense was grand larceny if the value of the property taken was greater than twelve pence , approximately the value of a sheep in the thirteenth century this limitation means that acts of common law larceny can not be committed against land 4 blackstone at 232 or items attached to or forming part of land , such as buildings , trees or shrubbery , crops growing in the field , or minerals however , one of the remarkable qualities of property is its shiftiness : its ability to change its character often and quickly , from real to personal and from personal to real some states may also charge certain types of larceny as '' robbery '' , '' burglary '' , '' theft '' , '' shoplifting '' , '' conversion '' , and other terms the court read asportation as merely a corroborative element of possession and control , and thus not necessary to establish possession and control of a car because transportation is the purpose of a car services and labor , as well as intangible personal property ( incorporeal rights ) such as contract rights and chose , singer & lafond , criminal law ( aspen 1987 ) , at 256 ancient roman law ( first 50 years of written university law , possibly borrowing from greek law there is no copy of ) was more lax about '' simple possession '' ; it was assumed '' borrowing '' if there was no one to ask : unless or until other mitigating factors arose ( such as refusal to return promptly when asked ) however , the punishment for grand larceny was death while the punishment for petit larceny was forfeiture of property to the crown and whipping for example , if a customer of a bank delivers money to a teller to deposit in the customer 's account , the teller had possession of the property and his misappropriation would be embezzlement rather than larceny therefore , it is possible for the person who has title to the property to steal the property from a person who had lawful possession an example of conversion is when a person logs checks in a check register or transaction log as being used for one specific purpose and then explicitly uses the funds from the checking account for another and completely different purpose
