homer , iliad , 18.376 it is more often used to describe non-electronic moving machines , especially those that have been made to resemble human or animal actions , such as the jacks on old public striking clocks , or the cuckoo and any other animated figures on a cuckoo clock there are many examples of automata in greek mythology : hephaestus created automata for his workshop ; him she found sweating with toil as he moved to and fro about his bellows in eager haste ; for he was fashioning tripods , twenty in all , to stand around the wall of his well-builded hall , and golden wheels had he set beneath the base of each that of themselves they might enter the gathering of the gods at his wish and again return to his house , a wonder to behold numerous water-powered automata were built by ktesibios , a greek inventor and the first head of the great library of alexandria , for example he '' used water to sound a whistle and make a model owl move this tradition continued in alexandria with inventors such as the greek mathematician hero of alexandria ( sometimes known as heron ) , whose writings on hydraulics , pneumatics , and mechanics described siphons , a fire engine , a water organ , the aeolipile , and a programmable cart the clockwork is thought to have come originally from rhodes , where there was apparently a tradition of mechanical engineering ; the island was renowned for its automata ; to quote pindar 's seventh olympic ode : : the animated figures stand : adorning every public street : and seem to breathe in stone , or : move their marble feet according to jewish legend , solomon used his wisdom to design a throne with mechanical animals which hailed him as king when he ascended it ; upon sitting down an eagle would place a crown upon his head , and a dove would bring him a torah scroll on his visit to constantinople in 949 ambassador liutprand of cremona described automata in the emperor theophilos ' palace , including which includes a puppet of a camelid driven by a clothed primate twice the height of a human being and an automaton of mary magdalene in 1454 , duke philip created an entertainment show named the extravagant feast of the pheasant , which was intended to influence the duke 's peers to participate in a crusade against the ottomans but ended up being a grand display of automata , giants , and dwarves the monk is driven by a key-wound spring and walks the path of a square , striking his chest with his right arm , while raising and lowering a small wooden cross and rosary in his left hand , turning and nodding his head , rolling his eyes , and mouthing silent obsequies a new attitude towards automata is to be found in rené descartes when he suggested that the bodies of animals are nothing more than complex machines - the bones , muscles and organs could be replaced with cogs , pistons and cams thus , in 1649 , when louis xiv was still a child , an artisan named camus designed for him a miniature coach , and horses complete with footmen , page and a lady within the coach ; all these figures exhibited a perfect movement he also constructed the tambourine player and the digesting duck , a mechanical duck that - apart from quacking and flapping its wings - gave the false illusion of eating and defecating , seeming to endorse cartesian ideas that animals are no more than machines of flesh in 1769 , a chess-playing machine called the turk , created by wolfgang von kempelen , made the rounds of the courts of europe purporting to be an automaton michel foucault , discipline and punish , new york , vintage books , 1979 , p.136 : '' the classical age discovered the body as object and target of power the great book of man-the-machine was written simultaneously on two registers : the anatomico-metaphysical register , of which descartes wrote the first pages and which the physicians and philosophers continued , and the technico-political register , which was constituted by a whole set of regulations and by empirical and calculated methods relating to the army , the school and the hospital , for controlling or correcting the operations of the body these two registers are quite distinct , since it was a question , on one hand , of submission and use and , on the other , of functioning and explanation : there was a useful body and an intelligible body the celebrated automata of the 18th century were not only a way of illustrating an organism , they were also political puppets , small-scale models of power : frederick , the meticulous king of small machines , well-trained regiments and long exercises , was obsessed with them hidden inside the chair were levers , connecting rods and compressed air tubes , which made the automaton 's lips and fingers move on the flute according to a program recorded on a cylinder similar to those used in player pianos contemporary automata are represented by the works of cabaret mechanical theatre in the united kingdom , dug north and chomick+meder , thomas kuntz , arthur ganson , joe jones , and nico cox in the united states , le défenseur du temps by french artist jacques monestier ( artiste ) , and françois junod in switzerland in 2016 , the nasa innovative advanced concepts program studied a rover , the automaton rover for extreme environments , designed to survive for an extended time in venus ' environmental conditions unlike other modern automata , aree is an automaton instead of a robot for practical reasons — venus 's harsh conditions , particularly its surface temperature of , make operating electronics there for any significant time impossible
