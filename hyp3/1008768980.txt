the hierarchy of the bajoran faith has never been explained in great detail , though a certain amount is known : titles in the bajoran religion include a '' prylar '' ( roughly equivalent to a christian monk ) , '' ranjen '' ( a rank falling between prylars and the next rank , and responsible for a variety of tasks ) , '' mylar '' ( priest or minister , mentioned in '' ties of blood and water '' ) , '' vedek '' ( cardinal , bishop ) and '' kai '' ( equivalent to the pope in catholic theology or patriarch in the eastern orthodox theology ) in similarity to christianity , the non-canon deep space nine relaunch novels reveal the existence of a form of excommunication from the bajoran faith : when kira nerys interferes in a growing civil war , despite being ordered not to do so by the vedek assembly , she is declared '' attainted '' and can no longer attend bajoran services , set foot in a temple , or study from an orb or the bajoran sacred texts later , at the beginning of the dominion war , captain sisko convinced kai winn , as well as the council of ministers , to sign a non-aggression treaty with the dominion ; sisko wanted to ensure bajor was kept out of the fighting so everything they had accomplished in the past five years would n't be destroyed by the war in 2369 , the cardassian civilian authorities ordered the military to withdraw from bajor , after which the bajoran provisional government invited the united federation of planets to set up base on the former cardassian mining station of terok nor , renaming it deep space nine , and requesting membership into the federation at the start of the dominion war , bajor officially declared their neutrality ( '' call to arms '' ) , although many bajorans joined starfleet and , as well , a new resistance to the occupation of deep space nine is formed similarly to christianity 's satan , kosst amojan ( '' the evil one '' ) was a prophet who was forced out of the celestial temple after a failed attempt to seize control , with the other pagh wraiths , which are similar to fallen angels in christianity in the series finale , '' what you leave behind '' , dukat and winn adami attempt to free the pagh

characters felt the provisional government would collapse within a matter of weeks , leading to civil war ( which the cardassians might use as an excuse to return to '' restore order '' ) there are some orthodox groups within the religion who take a rather dim view of science ( more specifically a scientific interpretation of the wormhole ) and the beliefs of other species , but this is a small minority , with relatively little support among the people a three-part arc , '' the homecoming '' , '' the circle '' , and '' the siege '' , featured a story about the provisional government and its inability to resolve an explosive political revolution flag officers wear a more elaborate version of the normal duty uniform officers of the militia were usually graduates of the bajoran military academy , although many commissions were awarded on the basis of demonstrated skills and merit of the soldiers who were part of the resistance against the occupation it was said in the star trek : deep space nine episode '' rapture '' that if bajor joins the united federation of planets , most of the bajoran militia would be absorbed into starfleet like many aliens on star trek , the bajorans are human-like in appearance , but have a distinctive symmetrical facial feature : a series of horizontal ridges on the bridge of the nose between the eyes the wraiths , also known as kosst amojan ( bajoran for '' to be expelled '' ) , work against the prophets , trying to enforce their own claim that they are the true gods of bajor the prophets , or '' the wormhole aliens '' ( as they are

prophets ( the gods ) —each of which has a unique ability such as the orb of time , which allows those viewing it to revisit past events in the deep space nine premiere episode '' emissary '' ,
