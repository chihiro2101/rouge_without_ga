with magic items , they wanted the effects of these items to be a mystery on each run through , and thus would initially present the items to the player only by a descriptor such as by color , and only later in the game give the true name of the item once the player experimented or used another means to identify the item after crafting a few games using curses to learn the library , they came up with the idea of an adventure game in the flavor of dungeons & dragons but to address their concerns with the static nature of adventure games , wanted to include elements that would change every time the game was played the two came up with a narrative , that of an adventurer setting out to explore and find treasures in the dungeons of doom , specifically the amulet of yendor ( the name '' rodney '' spelled backwards , which they envisioned as renowned wizard in the games narration ) toy wanted to move away from the notion of simply learning the right sequence of steps to complete within adventure games , and instead make the player focus on finding the right moves to avoid the character 's death at that moment ; wichman later called this idea '' consequence persistence '' wichman , still enrolled at ucsc , continued to help develop rogue for a time , such as adding armor elements , but the logistics of working over the distance made it difficult for him to keep up , and he let toy fully take over development initially , a rogue game had to be completed in one sitting , but by demand of playtesters , toy and wichman added the ability to save the state of the game , so that players could continue a game across sessions around 1982 , toy 's attention to rogue and computer games caused him to suffer poor academic performance , and he was kicked out of the school , shortly finding employment at university of california , berkeley ( ucb ) in their computer lab with its popularity on the ucb servers , rogue was selected as one of the game titles included in the 1983 distribution of 4.2 bsd , which spread across arpanet and quickly gained popularity among colleges and facilities with access to this hardware in the original text-based versions , all aspects of the game , including the dungeon , the player character , and monsters , are represented by letters and symbols within the ascii character set wichman was initially cautious due to the fact that his credit for rogue in the pc version had been cast as a '' contribution '' equal to the ucsc playtesters rather than as equal to toy , arnold , or lane for monsters , they wanted to have more advanced intelligence routines as the player got to deeper depths of the dungeons , but had started running into memory limits on the vax-11 , and simply made the monsters stronger with more health to pose more of a challenge rogue by mastertronic from world of spectrum numerous clones exist for modern operating systems such as microsoft windows , rogue for windows from prankster.com mac os x , rogue for os x from sourceforge palm os , roguelikes for palmos from sourceforge linux , with various versions of rogue bsd oss , and ios however , as neither toy , wichman , nor arnold released the source code of the game , these efforts generally required the programmers to craft the core game elements from scratch to mimic rogue they found a solution through procedural generation , where each level would start on the idea of a 3x3 tic tac toe grid , with each room of various size occupying one space in this grid , and then creating the hallways to connect the rooms the history of rogue : have you , you deadly z 's from gamasutra by bill loguidice and matt barton rogue 1984 â€“ the dos game , the history , the science rogue central coredumpcentral.org information , documentation , screenshots , and various versions for download and online play rogues distribution in 4.2 bsd did not include its source code , so after toy and arnold separately left ucb , they took the code with them , making it difficult for anyone to build off it around 1984 , robert borch , the vice president of publishing at epyx discovered that rogue had become popular by several of epyx 's employees and that they suggested that epyx should help fund ports to other systems one such program , rog-o-matic , was developed in 1981 to play and win the game , by four graduate students in the computer science department at carnegie-mellon university in pittsburgh : andrew appel , leonard harney , guy jacobson and michael loren mauldin they also took steps to avoid potential copyright issues with tsr , the company that owned dungeons & dragons at that time , by changing the names of monsters like kobolds that were unique to that game besides the competition from more graphically-interesting games , wichman attributed the failure to the fact that the commercial version of rogue was essentially the same game previously offered for free via bsd and did not pose a new challenge toy left ucb sometime before 1984 and took a consulting position with olivetti , an italian typewriter company that at the time were starting development of their own computer based on the ibm personal computer ( ibm pc ) operating system toy and lane initially funded the publishing , distribution , and promotion of the ibm pc version themselves , and though they continued to gain sales , they were only able to break even as they lacked the power of a larger distributor adventure , considered the first text-based adventure game , challenged the player to explore a cave system through descriptions given by the computer and commands issued by the player none of toy , wichman , arnold , or lane profited greatly from rogue , though they became renowned in the industry for their participation on the game wichman came up with the name rogue , based on the idea that unlike the party-based systems of dungeons & dragons , the player 's character was going at this alone
