although mexico ceded alta california and santa fe de nuevo méxico , the text of the treaty did not list territories to be ceded , and avoided the disputed issues that were causes of war : the validity of the 1836 secession of the republic of texas , texas 's unenforced boundary claims as far as the rio grande , and the 1845 texas annexation by the united states from east to west , the border consisted of the rio grande northwest from its mouth to the point where it strikes the southern boundary of new mexico ( roughly 32 degrees north ) , as shown in the disturnell map , then due west from this point to the 110th meridian west , then north along the 110th meridian to the gila river and down the river to its mouth unlike the new mexico segment of the boundary , which depended partly on unknown geography , '' in order to preclude all difficulty in tracing upon the ground the limit separating upper from lower california '' , a straight line was drawn from the mouth of the gila to one league ( unit ) south of the southernmost point of the port of san diego , slightly north of the the californias border at rosarito beach comparing the boundary in the adams–onís treaty to the guadalupe hidalgo boundary , mexico conceded about 55 % of its pre-war , pre-texas territorial claims and now has an area of 1,972,550 & nbsp ; km² ( 761,606 sq mi ) in the united states , the 1.36 million km² ( 525,000 square miles ) of the area between the adams-onis and guadalupe hidalgo boundaries outside the claimed by the republic of texas is known as the mexican cession that is to say , the mexican cession is construed not to include any territory east of the rio grande , while the territorial claims of the republic of texas included no territory west of the rio grande the mexican cession included essentially the entirety of the former mexican territory of alta california , but only the western portion of santa fe de nuevo mexico , and includes all of present-day california , nevada and utah , most of arizona , and western portions of new mexico and colorado article xii engaged the united states to pay , '' in consideration of the extension acquired '' , 15 million dollars ( equivalent to million today ) , in annual installments of 3 million dollars it provided that the united states would prevent and punish raids by indians into mexico , prohibited americans from acquiring property , including livestock , taken by the indians in those raids , and stated that the u.s the land that the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo brought into the united states became , between 1850 and 1912 , all or part of ten states : california ( 1850 ) , nevada ( 1864 ) , utah ( 1896 ) , and arizona ( 1912 ) , as well as , depending upon interpretation , the entire state of texas ( 1845 ) , which then included part of kansas ( 1861 ) ; colorado ( 1876 ) ; oklahoma ( 1907 ) ; and new mexico ( 1912 ) the remainder ( the southern parts ) of new mexico and arizona were peacefully purchased under the gadsden purchase , which was carried out in 1853 however , the american civil war delayed construction of such a route , and it was not until 1881 that the southern pacific railroad finally was completed as a second transcontinental railroad , fulfilling the purpose of the acquisition most of that land was too dry ( low rainfall ) and too mountainous to support many people , until the advent of new technology after about 1880 : means for damming and distributing water from the few rivers to irrigation ; the telegraph ; the railroad ; the telephone ; and electrical power about 80,000 mexicans inhabited california , new mexico , arizona , and texas during the period 1845 to 1850 , with far fewer in nevada , southern and western colorado , and utah the united kingdom and france , both of which recognized the independence of the republic of texas , repeatedly tried to dissuade mexico from declaring war against its northern neighbor earlier in that year , mexico had broken off diplomatic relations with the united states , based partly on its interpretation of the adams–onís treaty of 1819 , under which newly independent mexico claimed it had inherited rights after the thornton affair of 25–26 april , when mexican forces attacked an american unit in the disputed area , with the result that 11 americans were killed , five wounded and 49 captured , congress passed a declaration of war , which polk signed on 13 may 1846 but president polk 's state of the union address in december 1847 upheld mexican independence and argued at length that occupation and any further military operations in mexico were aimed at securing a treaty ceding california and new mexico up to approximately the 32nd parallel north and possibly baja california and transit rights across the isthmus of tehuantepec the mexicans proposed peace terms that offered only sale of alta california north of the 37th parallel north & nbsp ; — north of santa cruz , california and madera , california and the southern boundaries of today 's utah and colorado this territory was already dominated by anglo-american settlers , but perhaps more importantly from the mexican point of view , it represented the bulk of pre-war mexican territory north of the missouri compromise line of parallel 36°30′ north & nbsp ; — lands that , if annexed by the u.s while the mexican government could not reasonably have expected the polk administration to accept such terms , it would have had reason to hope that a rejection of peace terms so favorable to northern interests might have the potential to provoke sectional conflict in the united states , or perhaps even a civil war that would fatally undermine the u.s cuevas , bernardo couto and miguel atristain as plenipotentiary representatives of mexico on 2 february 1848 , at the main altar of the old basilica of guadalupe at villa hidalgo ( within the present city limits ) as u.s article viii guaranteed that mexicans who remained more than one year in the ceded lands would automatically become full-fledged united states citizens ( or they could declare their intention of remaining mexican citizens ) ; however , the senate modified article ix , changing the first paragraph and excluding the last two among the changes was that mexican citizens would '' be admitted at the proper time ( to be judged of by the congress of the united states ) '' instead of '' admitted as soon as possible '' , as negotiated between trist and the mexican delegation senate by a vote of 38 to 14 on 10 march 1848 and by mexico through a legislative vote of 51 to 34 and a senate vote of 33 to 4 , on 19 may 1848 on 30 may 1848 , when the two countries exchanged ratifications of the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo , they further negotiated a three-article protocol to explain the amendments the protocol further noted that said explanations had been accepted by the mexican minister of foreign affairs on behalf of the mexican government , and was signed in querétaro by a in addition to the sale of land , the treaty also provided for the recognition of the rio grande as the boundary between the state of texas and mexico the land boundaries were established by a survey team of appointed mexican and american representatives , and published in three volumes as the united states and mexican boundary survey the southern border of california was designated as a line from the junction of the colorado and gila rivers westward to the pacific ocean , so that it passes one spanish league south of the southernmost portion of san diego bay nonetheless , racially tinged tensions persisted in the era following annexation , reflected in such things as the greaser act in california , as tens of thousands of mexican nationals suddenly found themselves living within the borders of the united states states of arizona , california , colorado , nevada , new mexico , utah , and wyoming from the treaty the desire to expand the territory of the united states continued unabated and mexico 's economic problems persisted , the u.s.-mexico border : the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo , john c the shifting of the rio grande since the signing of the treaty of guadalupe caused a dispute over the boundary between the states of new mexico and texas , a case referred to as the country club dispute that was decided by the u.s the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo led to the establishment in 1889 of the international boundary and water commission to maintain the border , and pursuant to newer treaties to allocate river waters between the two nations , and to provide for flood control and water sanitation
