anemonefish are endemic to the warmer waters of the indian ocean , including the red sea and pacific oceans , the great barrier reef , southeast asia , japan , and the indo-malaysian region anemonefish are omnivore and can feed on undigested food from their host anemones , and the feces matter from the anemonefish provides nutrients to the sea anemone anemonefish primarily feed on small zooplankton from the water column , such as copepods and tunicate larvae , with a small portion of their diet coming from algae , with the exception of pink skunk clownfish , which primarily feeds on algae anemonefish and sea anemones have a symbiosis relationship , each providing many benefits to the other the individual species are generally highly host specific , and especially the genera heteractis and stichodactyla , and the species bubble-tip anemone are frequent anemonefish partners the sea anemone protects the anemonefish from predators , as well as providing food through the scraps left from the anemone 's meals and occasional dead anemone tentacles and functions as a safe nest site growth , reproduction and survival of a tropical sea anemone ( actiniaria ) : benefits of hosting anemonefish , 2005 , cited in blogspot.com the nitrogen excreted from anemonefish increases the number of algae incorporated into the tissue of their hosts , which aids the anemone in tissue growth and regeneration the activity of the anemonefish results in greater water circulation around the sea anemone , and it has been suggested that their bright coloring might lure small fish to the anemone , which then catches them several theories are given about how they can survive the sea anemone poison : the mucus coating of the fish may be based on sugars rather than proteins anemonefish are the best known example of fish that are able to live among the venomous sea anemone tentacles , but several others occur , including juvenile threespot dascyllus , certain cardinalfish ( such as banggai cardinalfish ) , gobius incognitus , and juvenile painted greenling if the female anemonefish is removed from the group , such as by death , one of the largest and most dominant males becomes a female depending on the species , they can lay hundreds or thousands of eggs for example , by purposefully modifying their growth rate to remain small and submissive , the juveniles in a colony present no threat to the fitness of the adult male , thereby protecting themselves from being evicted by the dominant fish fecundity , or reproductive rate , of the females , usually ranges from 600 to 1500 eggs depending on her size in contrast to most animal species , the female-only occasionally takes responsibility for the eggs , with males expending most of the time and effort historically , anemonefish have been identified by morphological features and color pattern in the field , while in a laboratory , other features such as scalation of the head , tooth shape , and body proportions are used tricintus are in the same clade , with six species , a
