according to lee , '' the history of mankind was , from the earliest period of his life , a subject of the most indefatigable application ; and long lists of sovereigns , princes , and the driest chronological facts , once arranged in his memory , were never forgotten cuvier 's german education exposed him to the work of the geologist abraham gottlob werner ( 1750 - 1817 ) , whose neptunism and emphasis on the importance of rigorous , direct observation of three-dimensional , structural relationships of rock formations to geological understanding provided models for cuvier 's scientific theories and methods arriving in the spring of 1795 , at the age of 26 , he soon became the assistant of jean-claude mertrud ( 1728–1802 ) , who had been appointed to the chair of animal anatomy at the jardin des plantes in this paper , he analyzed skeletal remains of indian and african elephants , as well as mammoth fossils , and a fossil skeleton known at that time as the 'ohio animal ' cuvier 's analysis established , for the first time , the fact that african and indian elephants were different species and that mammoths were not the same species as either african or indian elephants , so must be extinct in this latter capacity , he visited the south of france , but in the early part of 1803 , he was chosen permanent secretary of the department of physical sciences of the academy , and he consequently abandoned the earlier appointment and returned to paris cuvier then devoted himself more especially to three lines of inquiry : ( i ) the structure and classification of the mollusca ; ( ii ) the comparative anatomy and systematic arrangement of the fishes ; ( iii ) fossil mammals and reptiles and , secondarily , the osteology of living forms belonging to the same groups during his lifetime , cuvier served as an imperial councilor under napoleon , president of the council of public instruction and chancellor of the university under the restored bourbons , grand officer of the legion of honour , a peer of france , minister of the interior , and president of the council of state under louis philippe cuvier was critical of theories of evolution , in particular those proposed by his contemporaries lamarck and geoffroy saint-hilaire , which involved the gradual transmutation of one form into another he studied the mummified cats and ibises that geoffroy had brought back from napoleon 's invasion of egypt , and showed they were no different from their living counterparts ; cuvier used this to support his claim that life forms did not evolve over time moreover , his commitment to the principle of the correlation of parts caused him to doubt that any mechanism could ever gradually modify any part of an animal in isolation from all the other parts ( in the way lamarck proposed ) , without rendering the animal unable to survive de lamarck ) , cuvier wrote that lamarck 's theory of evolution instead , he said , the typical form makes an abrupt appearance in the fossil record , and persists unchanged to the time of its extinction cuvier 's claim that new fossil forms appear abruptly in the geological record and then continue without alteration in overlying strata was used by later critics of evolution to support creationism , to whom the abruptness seemed consistent with special divine creation ( although cuvier 's finding that different types made their paleontological debuts in different geological strata clearly did not ) the lack of change was consistent with the supposed sacred immutability of '' species '' , but , again , the idea of extinction , of which cuvier was the great proponent , obviously was not in his essay on the theory of the earth , he did say , '' no human bones have yet been found among fossil remains '' , but he made it clear exactly what he meant : '' when i assert that human bones have not been hitherto found among extraneous fossils , i must be understood to speak of fossils , or petrifactions , properly so called '' ; english translation quoted from he was not dogmatic in this claim , however ; when new evidence came to light , he included in a later edition an appendix describing a skeleton that he freely admitted was an '' instance of a fossil human petrifaction '' the harshness of his criticism and the strength of his reputation , however , continued to discourage naturalists from speculating about the gradual transmutation of species , until charles darwin published on the origin of species more than two decades after cuvier 's death early in his tenure at the national museum in paris , cuvier published studies of fossil bones in which he argued that they belonged to large , extinct quadrupeds his first two such publications were those identifying mammoth and mastodon fossils as belonging to extinct species rather than modern elephants and the study in which he identified the megatherium as a giant , extinct species of sloth cuvier wrote of his paleontological method that '' the form of the tooth leads to the form of the condyle , that of the scapula to that of the nails , just as an equation of a curve implies all of its properties ; and , just as in taking each property separately as the basis of a special equation we are able to return to the original equation and other associated properties , similarly , the nails , the scapula , the condyle , the femur , each separately revel the tooth or each other ; and by beginning from each of them the thoughtful professor of the laws of organic economy can reconstruct the entire animal '' however , cuvier 's actual method was heavily dependent on the comparison of fossil specimens with the anatomy of extant species in the necessary context of his vast knowledge of animal anatomy and access to unparallelled natural history collections in paris ultimately , his repeated identification of fossils as belonging to species unknown to man , combined with mineralogical evidence from his stratigraphical studies in paris , drove cuvier to the proposition that the abrupt changes the earth underwent over a long period of time caused some species to go extinct however , cuvier 's theory of extinction is still justified in the case of mass extinctions that occurred in the last 600 million years , when approximately half of all living species went completely extinct within a short geological span of two million years , due in part by volcanic eruptions , asteroids , and rapid fluctuations in sea level near the end of his 1796 paper on living and fossil elephants , he said : : all of these facts , consistent among themselves , and not opposed by any report , seem to me to prove the existence of a world previous to ours , destroyed by some kind of catastrophe this led cuvier to become an active proponent of the geological school of thought called catastrophism , which maintained that many of the geological features of the earth and the history of life could be explained by catastrophic events that had caused the extinction of many species of animals he wrote about these ideas many times , in particular he discussed them in great detail in the preliminary discourse ( an introduction ) to a collection of his papers , recherches sur les ossements fossiles de quadrupèdes ( researches on quadruped fossil bones ) , on quadruped fossils published in 1812 the 'preliminary discourse ' became very well known and , unauthorized translations were made into english , german , and italian ( and in the case of those in english , not entirely accurately ) after cuvier 's death , the catastrophic school of geological thought lost ground to uniformitarianism , as championed by charles lyell and others , which claimed that the geological features of the earth were best explained by currently observable forces , such as erosion and volcanism , acting gradually over an extended period of time the increasing interest in the topic of mass extinction starting in the late twentieth century , however , has led to a resurgence of interest among historians of science and other scholars in this aspect of cuvier 's work along with william smith 's work during the same period on a geological map of england , which also used characteristic fossils and the principle of faunal succession to correlate layers of sedimentary rock , the monograph helped establish the scientific discipline of stratigraphy in 1800 and working only from a drawing , cuvier was the first to correctly identify in print , a fossil found in bavaria as a small flying reptile , which he named the ptero-dactyle in 1809 , ( later latinized as pterodactylus antiquus ) —the first known member of the diverse order of pterosaurs this speculation was confirmed over the two decades following his death by a series of spectacular finds , mostly by english geologists and fossil collectors such as mary anning , william conybeare , william buckland , and gideon mantell , who found and described the first ichthyosaurs , plesiosaurs , and dinosaurs he writes : : if an animal 's teeth are such as they must be , in order for it to nourish itself with flesh , we can be sure without further examination that the whole system of its digestive organs is appropriate for that kind of food , and that its whole skeleton and locomotive organs , and even its sense organs , are arranged in such a way as to make it skillful at pursuing and catching its prey cuvier hoped that his principles of anatomy would provide the law-based framework that would elevate natural history to the truly scientific level occupied by physics and chemistry thanks to the laws established by isaac newton ( 1643 - 1727 ) and antoine lavoisier ( 1743 - 1794 ) , respectively he expressed confidence in the introduction to le règne animal that some day anatomy would be expressed as laws as simple , mathematical , and predictive as newton 's laws of physics , and he viewed his principle as an important step in that direction see discussion in in the same 1798 paper on the fossil remains of an animal found in plaster quarries near paris , cuvier emphasizes the predictive power of his principle , writing , today comparative anatomy has reached such a point of perfection that , after inspecting a single bone , one can often determine the class , and sometimes even the genus of the animal to which it belonged , above all if that bone belonged to the head or the limbs this is because the number , direction , and shape of the bones that compose each part of an animal 's body are always in a necessary relation to all the other parts , in such a way that—up to a point—one can infer the whole from any one of them and vice versa though cuvier believed that his principle 's major contribution was that it was a rational , mathematical way to reconstruct fossils and make predictions , in reality it was difficult for cuvier to use his principle in 1798 , cuvier published his first independent work , the tableau élémentaire de l'histoire naturelle des animaux , which was an abridgment of his course of lectures at the école du pantheon and may be regarded as the foundation and first statement of his natural classification of the animal kingdom in palaeontology , cuvier published a long list of memoirs , partly relating to the bones of extinct animals , and partly detailing the results of observations on the skeletons of living animals , specially examined with a view toward throwing light upon the structure and affinities of the fossil forms he produced an even larger body of work on fossils , dealing with the extinct mammals of the eocene beds of montmartre and other localities near paris , such as the buttes chaumont , the fossil species of hippopotamus , palaeotherium , a marsupial ( which he called didelphys gypsorum ) , the megalonyx , the megatherium , the cave hyena , the pterodactyl , the extinct species of rhinoceros , the cave bear , the mastodon , the extinct species of elephant , fossil species of manatee and seals , fossil forms of crocodile , turtle , fish , birds , etc if his identification of fossil animals was dependent upon comparison with the osteology of extant animals whose anatomy was poorly known , cuvier would often publish a thorough documentation of the relevant extant species ' anatomy before publishing his analyses of the fossil specimens the results of cuvier 's principal palaeontological and geological investigations ultimately were given to the world in the form of two separate works : recherches sur les ossemens fossiles de quadrupèdes ( paris , 1812 ; later editions in 1821 and 1825 ) ; and discours sur les revolutions de la surface du globe ( paris , 1825 ) cuvier 's racial studies held the supposed features of polygenism , namely fixity of species ; limits on environmental influence ; unchanging underlying type ; anatomical and cranial measurement differences in races ; physical and mental differences between distinct races apart from his own original investigations in zoology and paleontology cuvier carried out a vast amount of work as perpetual secretary of the national institute , and as an official connected with public education generally ; and much of this work appeared ultimately in a published form thus , in 1808 he was placed by napoleon upon the council of the imperial university , and in this capacity he presided ( in the years 1809 , 1811 , and 1813 ) over commissions charged to examine the state of the higher educational establishments in the districts beyond the alps and the rhine that had been annexed to france , and to report upon the means by which these could be affiliated with the central university in his capacity , again , of perpetual secretary of the institute , he not only prepared a number of éloges historiques on deceased members of the academy of sciences , but was also the author of a number of reports on the history of the physical and natural sciences , the most important of these being the rapport historique sur le progrès des sciences physiques depuis 1789 , published in 1810 cuvier is commemorated in the naming of several animals ; they include cuvier 's beaked whale ( which he first thought to be extinct ) , cuvier 's gazelle , cuvier 's toucan , cuvier 's bichir , cuvier 's dwarf caiman , and galeocerdo cuvier ( tiger shark ) tableau élémentaire de l'histoire naturelle des animaux ( 1797–1798 ) leçons d'anatomie comparée ( 5 volumes , 1800–1805 ) essais sur la géographie minéralogique des
