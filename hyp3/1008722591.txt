the english spelling bokeh was popularized in 1997 in photo techniques magazine , when mike johnston , the editor at the time , commissioned three papers on the topic for the may/june 1997 issue ; he altered the spelling to suggest the correct pronunciation to english speakers , saying '' it is properly pronounced with bo as in bone and ke as in kenneth , with equal stress on either syllable '' this is derived as a noun form of the verb bokeru , which is written in several ways , with additional meanings and nuances : refers to being blurry , hazy or out-of-focus , whereas the and spellings refer to being mentally hazy , befuddled , childish , senile , or playing stupid recently , photographers have exploited the shape of the bokeh by creating a simple mask out of card with shapes such as hearts or stars , that the photographer wishes the bokeh to be , and placing it over the lens by using barcodes as small as 3 & nbsp ; mm with a small lens over them , if the barcode is viewed out of focus through an ordinary camera focused at infinity , the resulting image is large enough to scan the information in the barcode an alternative mechanical mechanism has been proposed for generating bokeh in small aperture cameras such as compacts or cellphone cameras , called image destabilisation , in which both the lens and sensor are moved in order to maintain focus at one focal plane , while defocusing nearby ones both of these phones use dual cameras to detect edges and create a '' depth map '' of the image , which the phone uses to blur the out-of-focus portions of the photo unlike conventional convolution , this convolution has a kernel that depends on the distance of each image point and & nbsp ; – at least in principle & nbsp ; – has to include image points that are occluded by objects in the foreground image : circles of confusion lens diagram.svg thumb right 280px the depth of field is the region where the size of the circle of confusion is less than the resolution of the human eye the related verb hōkeru shares spelling with these and has the same meanings ; in addition , that form acts as compound verb suffix , indicating that the subject is absorbed into the action denoted by the main verb : for instance , asobihōkeru , combining asobu and hōkeru , expresses being absorbed in play the nikon 105 mm dc-nikkor and 135 mm dc-nikkor lenses ( dc stands for '' defocus control '' ) have a control ring that permits the overcorrection or undercorrection of spherical aberration to change the bokeh in front of and behind the focal plane image : faux-bokeh-comparison.jpg thumb 500px right bokeh can be simulated by convolving the image with a kernel that corresponds to the image of an out-of-focus point source taken with a real camera when used in portrait photography ( for their '' natural '' perspective ) , the photographer usually wants a shallow depth of field , so that the subject stands out sharply against a blurred background the term comes from the japanese word boke or , which means '' blur '' or '' haze '' , or boke-aji , the '' blur quality '' to a first approximation , defocus blur is convolution by a uniform disk , a more computationally intensive operation than the '' standard '' gaussian blur ; the former produces sharp circles around highlights whereas the latter is a much softer effect the first , a 20 mp lens , uses a 1/2.78 '' sensor with f/2.0 aperture , while the second , an 8 mp f/2.0 lens , captures depth information for conventional lens designs ( with bladed apertures ) , when a lens is stopped down smaller than its maximum aperture size ( minimum f-number ) , out-of-focus points are blurred into the polygonal shape formed by the aperture blades the use of anamorphic lenses will cause bokeh to appear differently along the horizontal and vertical axes of the lens , becoming ellipsoidal compared to those in a spherical lens
