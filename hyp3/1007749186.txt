an early example of parliamentary government developed in today 's netherlands and belgium during the dutch revolt ( 1581 ) , when the sovereign , legislative and executive powers were taken over by the states general of the netherlands from the monarch , king philip ii of spain later , in the 17th century , the parliament of england pioneered some of the ideas and systems of liberal democracy culminating in the glorious revolution and passage of the bill of rights 1689 the gradual democratisation of parliament with the broadening of the voting franchise increased parliament 's role in controlling government , and in deciding whom the king could ask to form a government other countries gradually adopted what came to be called the westminster model of government , with an executive answerable to parliament , and exercising , in the name of the head of state , powers nominally vested in the head of state such a system became particularly prevalent in older british dominions , many of which had their constitutions enacted by the british parliament ; such as australia , new zealand , canada , the irish free state and the union of south africa some of these parliaments were reformed from , or were initially developed as distinct from their original british model : the australian senate , for instance , has since its inception more closely reflected the us senate than the british house of lords ; whereas since 1950 there is no upper house in new zealand democracy and parliamentarism became increasingly prevalent in europe in the years after world war i , partially imposed by the democratic victors , the united states , great britain and france , on the defeated countries and their successors , notably weimar germany and the new austrian republic a bicameral parliament usually consists of a directly elected lower house with the power to determine the executive government , and an upper house which may be appointed or elected through a different mechanism from the lower house some parliaments in this model are elected using a plurality voting system ( first past the post ) , such as the united kingdom , canada , and india , while others use some form of proportional representation , such as ireland and new zealand implementations of the parliamentary system can also differ as to how the prime minister and government are appointed and whether the government needs the explicit approval of the parliament , rather than just the absence of its disapproval some countries such as india also require the prime minister to be a member of the legislature , though in other countries this only exists as a convention while in practice most prime ministers under the westminster system ( including australia , canada , india , new zealand and the united kingdom ) are the leaders of the largest party in parliament , technically the appointment of the prime minister is a prerogative exercised by the monarch , the governor-general , or the president no parliamentary vote takes place on who is forming a government , but since parliament can immediately defeat the government with a motion of no confidence , the head of state is limited by convention to choosing a candidate who can command the confidence of parliament , and thus has little or no influence in the decision example : under the swedish instrument of government ( 1974 ) , the power to appoint someone to form a government has been moved from the monarch to the speaker of parliament and the parliament itself furthermore , there are variations as to what conditions exist ( if any ) for the government to have the right to dissolve the parliament : in some countries , such as denmark , malaysia , australia and new zealand , the prime minister has the de facto power to call an election , at will since 2011 in the united kingdom , the house of commons may be dissolved early only by a vote of two-thirds of its members , or if a vote of non-confidence passes and no alternative government is formed in the next fourteen days the parliamentary system can be contrasted with a presidential system which operates under a stricter separation of powers , whereby the executive does not form part of—nor is appointed by—the parliamentary or legislative body parliamentary systems like that found in the united kingdom are widely considered to be more flexible , allowing rapid change in legislation and policy as long as there is a stable majority or coalition in parliament , allowing the government to have 'few legal limits on what it can do ' due to the first-past-the-post 'this system produces the classic '' westminster model '' with the twin virtues of strong but responsive party government' in a presidential system , all executive power is vested in one person , the president , whereas power is more divided in a parliamentary system with its collegial executive it can be argued that power is more evenly spread out in parliamentary government , as the government and prime minister do not have the power to make unilateral decisions , as the entire government cabinet is answerable and accountable to parliament parliamentary systems are less likely to allow celebrity-based politics to fully dominate a society , unlike what often happens in presidential systems , where name-recall and popularity can catapult a celebrity , actor , or popular politician to the presidency despite such candidate 's lack of competence and experience bagehot considered the four-year election rule of the united states to be unnatural , as it can potentially allow a president who has disappointed the public with a dismal performance in the second year of his term to continue on until the end of his four-year term ) thus , by a shrewd timing of elections , in a parliamentary system , a party can extend its rule for longer than is feasible in a functioning presidential system
