according to thomas nagel in his paper what is it like to be a bat ? , consciousness can refer to the ability of any entity to have subjective perceptual experiences , or as some philosophers refer to them , '' qualia '' —in other words , the ability to have states that it feels like something to be in according to damasio , sentience is a minimalistic way of defining consciousness , which otherwise commonly and collectively describes sentience plus further features of the mind and consciousness , such as creativity , intelligence , sapience , self-awareness , and intentionality ( the ability to have thoughts about something ) data losses inherent in all information transfer from more precise systems to less precise systems are also argued to make it impossible for any imprecise system to use a more precise system as an '' emissary '' , as a less precise system would not be able to tell whether the outdata from the more precise system was in the interest of the less precise system or not it defines sentience as the relationship between the information processing rate of each individual processing unit ( neuron ) , the weight/size of a single unit , and the total number of processing units ( expressed as mass ) the claim that precise recognition exists as specific attention to some details in a modular mind is criticized both with regard to data loss as a small system of disambiguating synapses in a module physically can not make as precise distinctions as a interferometry encompassing the whole brain , and for energy loss as having one system for motivation that needs some built-in cognition to recognize anything anyway and another cognitive system for making strategies would cost more energy than integrating it all in one system that use the same synapses see the four most popular ai textbooks ( or wikipedia 's survey of their contents ) , none of which mention '' sentience '' at all : it is sometimes used in popular accounts of ai to describe '' human level or higher intelligence '' ( or artificial general intelligence ) the term sentient beings is translated from various sanskrit terms ( jantu , bahu jana , jagat , sattva ) and '' conventionally refers to the mass of living things subject to illusion , suffering , and rebirth ( saṃsāra ) '' it was proposed as a measure for the sentience of all living beings and computers from a single neuron up to a hypothetical being at the theoretical computational limit of the entire universe regarding animal consciousness , according to the animal consciousness , which was publicly proclaimed on 7 july 2012 at the cambridge university , consciousness is that which requires specialized nervous system , chiefly neuroanatomical , neurochemical , and neurophysiological substrates , which manifests in more complex organisms as the central nervous system , to exhibit consciousness water , for example , is a sentient being of the first order , as it is considered to possess only one sense , that of touch sugunasiri is founder of nalanda college of buddhist studies , toronto , canada jeremy bentham - introduction to the principles of morals and legislation book about a theory of sentience readership : philosophers , psychologists , and neuroscientists interested in sensation and perception in mahayana buddhism , which includes zen and tibetan buddhism , the concept is related to the bodhisattva , an enlightened being devoted to the liberation of others it is shown that both brain size and brain-wide connectivity contribute to make perception more discriminating , as predicted by the theory of a brain-wide perception system but not by the theory of separate systems for emotion and cognition the documentary earthlings argues that while animals do not have all the desires and ability to comprehend as do humans , they do share the desires for food and water , shelter and companionship , freedom of movement and avoidance of pain these further features of consciousness may not be necessary for sentience , which rests on the capacity to feel sensations and emotions
