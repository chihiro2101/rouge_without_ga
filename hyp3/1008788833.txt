the navigation meanders in a broadly west to east direction between chelmsford and maldon , through countryside which is largely arable , and although it passes near to a number of villages , all of them are set back some distance from the waterway prior to the actual construction of the navigation , there had been almost 120 years of proposals for such a scheme , and opposition from the port of maldon , which anticipated that its revenues would fall if vessels could travel to chelmsford in july 1733 , john hore , who was involved in the kennet , stroudwater , and the avon navigation at bristol , proposed two schemes , one to make the river navigable , and another to create a new cut between chelmsford and maldon yeoman had a high standing as a civil engineer , and the opponents to the scheme tried to engage a suitable engineer to counter the proposal , but many of the obvious choices , including james brindley , declined because they were too busy finally in 1792 , with navigations in other parts of the country bringing increased prosperity to the towns they served , the people of chelmsford decide to avoid the opposition of maldon by bypassing it , and terminating the navigation at heybridge , on the river blackwater below maldon despite spirited opposition by maldon , the bill became an act of parliament on 17 june 1793 , creating the company of the proprietors of the chelmer and blackwater navigation , with powers to raise £40,000 by the issuing of shares , and a further £20,000 if required the port of maldon now tried to mitigate their loss , and with advice from benjamin latrobe , produced a plan to improve the blackwater through maldon to its junction with the chelmer at beeleigh , which was submitted to parliament in 1793 the navigation is unusual in that it was not nationalised in 1948 when most of the other waterways in the uk were , and remained under the control of the original company of proprietors of the chelmer & blackwater navigation ltd prior to the cessation of commercial traffic in 1972 , pleasure craft were prohibited from using the locks , and for a short period , the only boats to use the navigation were the company work boats and canoes '' the construction of housing and restaurants around the springfield basin site took place , including coates quay and waterfront place , which meant that the basin became accessible to the public for the first time , and lockside marina was built just above springfield lock after negotiations with the administrator , the inland waterways association ( iwa ) signed a maintenance and operating agreement in november 2005 to take over responsibility for the running of the navigation through a wholly owned subsidiary called essex waterways ltd waterways , issue 223 , ( spring 2009 ) , inland waterways association while essex waterways manage the navigation from day to day , it is still owned by the company of proprietors on 18 february 2016 , the chelmsford civic society held a meeting at the essex record office to consider the option of extending the canal from springfield basin to a new destination nearer to the town centre although the leader of the council actively opposed the concept , the idea of a better destination for the navigation had been a long standing dream , having first been proposed in 1985 in a report by the iwa , and embraced by the council in 2002 the link was downgraded to an '' aspiration '' following a 2008 planning enquiry , although it remained on the town centre development plans , and the replacement essex record office building was sited so that it would overlook the link the link ceased to be a favoured option in 2020 , after decisions to build a new link road between parkway and the site of the old gas works , which was being redeveloped as housing since 1995 , it had been maintained by the environment agency , but they decided that they could no longer justify the costs of maintaining the structure , which consists of two radial gates at either side of a central tilting gate , with a control building on the north bank of the river some 970 new homes are expected to be provided in the chelmsford waterside neighbourhood , and the council has obtained a grant of £10.7 million from the government ’ s housing infrastructure fund , enabling it to address issues of access , contamination of the land , and the presence of gas mains which currently hinder the development its maintenance is unusual , in that the northumbrian water group has a statutory obligation to maintain the mitre gates and the sea gate at the eastern end of the lock the construction of hanningfield reservoir was authorised in 1950 as a joint project between southend waterworks company and the south essex waterworks company , both of which are now part of essex and suffolk water , which is itself part of the northumbrian water group when the hanningfield water order 1950 was passed by parliament , it included a clause that made the water companies responsible for the lock gates , because water from the navigation would be pumped to the reservoir , and they needed to esnure that it would not become contaminated with salt this arrangement was modified by the chelmer navigation agreement 1964 , which moved the responsibility for carrying out repairs to the chelmer and blackwater company , but required the water companies to fund the work once its extent was agreed over time , the steelwork degraded , and the mechanism for controlling the flow of water into and out of the gate to alter its buoyancy ceased to operate , resulting in the rollers on which it moved seizing up
