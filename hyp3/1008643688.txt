in the early 1980s , most home computers manufactured in japan such as the nec pc-6001 and pc-8000 series , fujitsu 's fm-7 and fm-8 , and hitachi 's basic master featured a variant of the microsoft basic interpreter integrated into their on-board roms other japanese consumer electronics firms such as panasonic , canon , casio , yamaha , pioneer , and sanyo were searching for ways to enter the new home computer market inspired by the success of vhs as a standard for video cassette recorders , many japanese electronic manufacturers along with goldstar , philips and spectravideo built and promoted msx computers the history of spectravideo samdal.com , retrieved 2012-12-20 the standard consisted primarily of several off-the-shelf parts ; the main cpu was a 3.58 & nbsp ; mhz zilog z80 , the texas instruments tms9918 graphics chip with 16 & nbsp ; kb of dedicated vram , the sound and partial i/o support was provided by the ay-3-8910 chip manufactured by general instrument ( gi ) , and an intel 8255 programmable peripheral interface chip was used for the parallel i/o such as the keyboard this was a choice of components that was shared by many other home computers and games consoles of the period , such as the colecovision and sega sg-1000 video game systems spectravideo 's msx enjoyed very little success , and yamaha 's cx5m model , built to interface with various types of midi equipment , was billed more as a digital music tool than a standard personal computer the first three , msx ( 1983 ) , msx2 ( 1985 ) , and msx2+ ( 1988 ) , were all 8-bit computers based on the z80 microprocessor & nbsp ; 90 ) in its place , the msx turbor was released , which used the new custom 16-bit r800 microprocessor developed by ascii corporation intended for the msx3 , but features such as dma and 24-bit addressing were disabled classrooms full of networked yamaha msx computers were used for teaching informatics in schools in some arab countries , the soviet union , and cuba , where they were widely used in public schools , which allowed the cuban government to educate students in computer subjects before the msx 's lack of success in these markets became apparent , us manufacturer commodore business machines overhauled its product line in the early 1980s and introduced models such as the plus/4 and commodore 16 that were intended to better compete with the features of msx computers the apple ii sold 6 & nbsp ; million units , the zx spectrum over 5 million units , the atari 8-bit sold at least 4 & nbsp ; million units , the amstrad cpc sold 3 & nbsp ; million units , and the tandy trs-80 model 1 sold 250,000 & nbsp ; units the system msx most closely resembled was the spectravideo sv-328 home computer ( spectravideo even claimed to be '' msx compatible '' in advertisements before the actual launch of msx systems , but it was in fact not completely compatible with it ) it was also very common to port games from the zx spectrum to the msx , since both have the same cpu , the spectrum 128 had the same soundchip , and the zx spectrum 's graphic mode could be easily emulated on the msx 's screen-2 mode while msx has full application software compatibility at the firmware ( bios ) level , due to minor hardware differences , replacement of the bios with another from different pc may render incorrect scan code translations and thus incorrect behaviour of the keyboard subsystem for the application software several popular video game franchises were established on the msx : antarctic adventure and penguin adventure aleste and zanac ( the latter developed and released alongside the original fds version ) bomberman eggerland metal gear parodius puyo puyo others received various installments on the msx , including several titles unique to the system or largely reworked versions of games on other formats : castlevania ( as vampire killer ) contra dragon quest dragon slayer final fantasy gradius ( nemesis ) r-type wizardry xak xevious : fardraut saga ys ; msx : spectravideo , philips , al alamiah , sony , sanyo , mitsubishi , toshiba , hitachi , national/panasonic , canon , casio , pioneer , fujitsu , yamaha , jvc , yashica-kyocera , goldstar , samsung/fenner , daewoo , gradiente , sharp/epcom , talent woomb.net was the english counterpart of this and other japanese services offered by d4 enterprise , which also announced in august 2006 the launch of a new msx2 compatible system called the '' 1chipmsx '' , a system based on an altera cyclone ep1c12q240c8 fpga the new msx system is housed in a box made out of transparent blue plastic , and can be used with a standard monitor ( or tv ) and a pc keyboard on june 7 , 2008 , the msx resource center foundation reported that the msx trademark had moved from msx association to the msx licensing corporation , referring to a benelux trademark register page of msx , which names the msx licensing corporation as entitled entity till 28-10-2013 at that time , the website of the msx licensing corporation that they linked to as source , had a text saying 'we are planning to revitalize msx , the innovative computer platform however , the website was later changed to contain only the logo of itny & partners , and a link to itny & partners english and japanese websites and has no mention of the msx licensing corporation at all on , bazix reported on their website 's front page that they are no longer the representative of msx association , due to being unable to achieve their goals of '' bringing about the commercial msx revival beyond the japanese borders '' and '' the transfer of the msx trademark from msx association to msx licensing corporation '' and '' no outlook on any progress in the western one chip msx project any time soon '' on july 4 , 2008 , msx association 's european contact website , which states to be the '' only official contact place for msx association in europe '' , reports that the msx trademark and copyright has been under the msx licensing corporation holding ever since 1983 according to the same article , d4 enterprise '' refuse to pay royalties to msx association for the use of ese artists ' factory 's work in 1chipmsx and the software licenses in project egg '' , thus they deal with kazuhiko nishi 'directly ' through the msx licensing corporation in 2011 , age labs announced the launch of a msx kit called gr8bit - the do-it-yourself computer for learning purposes , which was licensed by the msx licensing corporation
