the cork is produced by the cork cambium which is a layer of meristematically active cells which serve as a lateral meristem for the periderm the cork cambium , which is also called the phellogen , is normally only one cell layer thick and it divides periclinally to the outside producing cork the phelloderm , which is not always present in all barks , is a layer of cells formed by and interior to the cork cambium , the cork cambium and the vascular cambium , are the only parts of a woody stem where cell division occurs ; undifferentiated cells in the vascular cambium divide rapidly to produce secondary xylem to the inside and secondary phloem to the outside in stems the cortex is between the epidermis layer and the phloem , in roots the inner layer is not phloem but the pericycle from the outside to the inside of a mature woody stem , the layers include : bark periderm cork ( phellem or suber ) , includes the rhytidome cork cambium ( phellogen ) phelloderm cortex phloem vascular cambium wood ( xylem ) sapwood ( alburnum ) heartwood ( duramen ) pith ( medulla ) in young stems , which lack what is commonly called bark , the tissues are , from the outside to the inside : epidermis , which may be replaced by periderm cortex primary and secondary phloem vascular cambium secondary and primary xylem the epidermis is a layer of cells that cover the plant body , including the stems , leaves , flowers and fruits , that protects the plant from the outside world often a secondary covering called the periderm forms on small woody stems and many non-woody plants , which is composed of cork ( phellem ) , the cork cambium ( phellogen ) , and the phelloderm as the stem grows , the cork cambium produces new layers of cork which are impermeable to gases and water and the cells outside the periderm , namely the epidermis , cortex and older secondary phloem die it is composed mostly of dead cells and is produced by the formation of multiple layers of suberin periderm , cortical and phloem tissue bark tissues make up by weight between 10â€“20 % of woody vascular plants and consists of various biopolymers , tannins , lignin , suberin , suberan and polysaccharides it has been proposed that , in the cork layer ( the phellogen ) , suberin acts as a barrier to microbial degradation and so protects the internal structure of the plant image : rindenmulch016.jpg thumb right barkdust cork , sometimes confused with bark in colloquial speech , is the outermost layer of a woody stem , derived from the cork cambium some barks can be removed in long sheets ; the smooth surfaced bark of birch trees has been used as a covering in the making of canoes , as the drainage layer in roofs , for shoes , backpacks etc the inner bark ( phloem ) of some trees is edible ; in scandinavia , bark bread is made from rye to which the toasted and ground innermost layer of bark of scots pine or birch is added the sami people of far northern europe used large sheets of pinus sylvestris bark that were removed in the spring , prepared and stored for use as a staple food resource and the inner bark was eaten fresh , dried or roasted bark contains strong fibres known as bast , and there is a long tradition in northern europe of using bark from coppiced young branches of the small-leaved lime ( tilia cordata ) to produce rope and rope , used for example in the rigging of viking age longships file : bark nunniong.jpg eucalypt bark file : close-up of living bark on a tree in england.jpg close-up of living bark on a tree in england file : acer capillipes ( snakebark maple )
