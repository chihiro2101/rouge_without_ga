middle mongol ( depending on classification spoken from the 13th century until the early 15th century or late 16th century ; given the almost entire lack of written sources for the period in between , an exact cutoff point can not be established ) classical mongolian , from approximately 1700 to 1900 mongolian language the standard mongolian language has been in official use since 1919 , and this form of the language is used in the economic , political , and social fields.the script for standard mongolian uses a version of the russian alphabet called the mongolian cyrillic alphabet '' for tabghach , the language of the founders of the northern wei dynasty , for which the surviving evidence is very sparse , and khitan , for which evidence exists that is written in the two khitan scripts ( large and small ) which have as yet not been fully deciphered , a direct affiliation to mongolic can now be taken to be most likely or even demonstrated proto-mongolic , the ancestor language of the modern mongolic languages , is very close to middle mongol , the language spoken at the time of genghis khan and the mongol empire juha janhunen ( 2006 ) classified the khitan language into the '' para-mongolic '' family , meaning that it is related to the mongolic languages as a sister group , rather than as a direct descendant of proto-mongolic in the case of early pre-proto-mongolic , certain loanwords in the mongolic languages point to early contact with oghur ( pre-proto-bulgaric ) turkic , also known as r-turkic another problem lies in the sheer comparability of terminology , as western linguists use language and dialect , while mongolian linguists use the grimmian trichotomy language ( kele ) , dialect ( nutuγ-un ayalγu ) and mundart ( aman ayalγu ) a less common subdivision of central mongolic is to divide it into a central dialect ( khalkha , chakhar , ordos ) , an eastern dialect ( kharchin , khorchin ) , a western dialect ( oirat , kalmyk ) , and a northern dialect ( consisting of two buryat varieties ) ( 2005:167–168 ) the broader delimitation of mongolian may be based on mutual intelligibility , but an analysis based on a tree diagram such as the one above faces other problems because of the close contacts between , for example , buryat and khalkha mongols during history , thus creating or preserving a dialect continuum the chuvash language , spoken by 1 million people in european russia , is the only living representative of oghur turkic which split from proto turkic around the 1st century ad ; mongolic dagur ( 96,000 speakers ) central mongolic khamnigan ( 2,000 speakers ) buryat ( 330,000 speakers ) mongolian proper ( 5.2 million speakers ) eastern and central dialect khalkha chakhar khorchin ordos ( 123,000 speakers ) oirat ( including kalmyk ) ( 360,000 speakers ) southern mongolic ( part of a gansu–qinghai sprachbund ) shira yugur ( 4,000 speakers ) shirongolic monguor ( 150,000 speakers ) bonan ( 6,000 speakers ) santa ( dongxiang ) ( 200,000 speakers ) kangjia ( 1,000 speakers ) moghol ( 200 speakers ) alexander vovin ( 2007 ) identifies the extinct tabγač or tuoba language as a mongolic language ( 2005:193–194 ) there is a tendency to call central mongolian a language consisting of mongolian proper , oirat and buryat , while ordos ( and implicitly also khamnigan ) is seen as a variety of mongolian proper the stages of historical mongolic are : pre-proto-mongolic , from approximately the 4th century ad until the 12th century ad , influenced by common turkic , and previously by bulgar turkic
