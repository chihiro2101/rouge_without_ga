like many other small birds , it has in the past been trapped in rural areas at its night roosts as an easily available addition to the diet , and in medieval times the practice of placing live birds under a pie crust just before serving may have been the origin of the familiar nursery rhyme : sing a song of sixpence , a pocket full of rye ; four and twenty blackbirds baked in a pie ! when the pie was opened the birds began to sing , oh , was n't that a dainty dish to set before the king ? the common blackbird 's melodious , distinctive song is mentioned in the poem adlestrop by edward thomas ; and for that minute a blackbird sang close by , and round him , mistier , farther and farther , all the birds of oxfordshire and gloucestershire the common blackbird is the national bird of sweden , which has a breeding population of 1–2 million pairs , and was featured on a 30 & nbsp ; öre christmas postage stamp in 1970 ; it has also featured on a number of other stamps issued by european and asian countries , including a 1966 4d british stamp and a 1998 irish 30p stamp in the western palearctic , populations are generally stable or increasing , p1215–1218 but there have been local declines , especially on farmland , which may be due to agricultural policies that encouraged farmers to remove hedgerows ( which provide nesting places ) , and to drain damp grassland and increase the use of pesticides , both of which could have reduced the availability of invertebrate food the common blackbird was introduced to australia by a bird dealer visiting melbourne in early 1857 , and its range has expanded from its initial foothold in melbourne and adelaide to include all of southeastern australia , including tasmania and the bass strait islands this is partly because it is more difficult for ticks to find another host on lawns and gardens in urban areas than in uncultivated rural areas , and partly because ticks are likely to be commoner in rural areas , where a variety of tick hosts , such as foxes , deer and boar , are more numerous this species is occasionally a host of parasitic cuckoos , such as the common cuckoo ( cuculus canorus ) , but this is minimal because the common blackbird recognizes the adult of the parasitic species and its mimicry eggs in the english christmas carol '' the twelve days of christmas '' , the line commonly sung today as '' four calling birds '' is believed to have originally been written in the 18th century as '' four colly birds '' , an archaism meaning '' black as coal '' that was a popular english nickname for the common blackbird thomas wrote that there is '' a suggestion of dark places about it '' , and it symbolised resignation in the 17th century tragic play the duchess of malfi ; an alternate connotation is vigilance , the bird 's clear cry warning of danger the introduced merula blackbird in new zealand , where the cuckoo does not occur , has , over the past 130 years , lost the ability to recognize the adult common cuckoo but still rejects non-mimetic eggs however , there is little direct evidence to show that either predation of the adult blackbirds or loss of the eggs and chicks to corvids , such as the european magpie or eurasian jay , decrease population numbers
