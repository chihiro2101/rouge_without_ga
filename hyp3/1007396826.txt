they tend to gather in flocks – sometimes up to about 100 birds – and frequently associate with storks , herons or ibises , but are highly territorial on the nest : despite being a colonial nester , breeding pairs – especially males – will stab at any other bird that ventures within reach of their long neck and bill centrarchidae ( sunfishes ) , cichlidae ( cichlids ) , cyprinidae ( carps , minnows and relatives ) , cyprinodontidae ( pupfishes ) , mugilidae ( mullets ) , plotosidae ( eeltail catfishes ) and poeciliidae ( livebearers ) : myers et al these birds are foot-propelled divers which quietly stalk and ambush their prey ; then they use their sharply pointed beak to impale the food animal on the underside of the cervical vertebrae 5–7 is a keel , which allows for muscles to attach to form a hinge-like mechanism that can project the neck , head and bill forward like a throwing spear after they have stabbed the prey , they return to the surface where they toss their food into the air and catch it again , so that they can swallow it head-first predators of darters are mainly large carnivorous birds , including passerines like the australian raven ( corvus coronoides ) and house crow ( corvus splendens ) , and birds of prey such as marsh harriers ( circus aeruginosus complex ) or pallas 's fish eagle ( haliaeetus leucoryphus ) the long neck and pointed bill in combination with the '' darting '' mechanism make the birds dangerous even to larger carnivorous mammals , and they will actually move toward an intruder to attack rather than defending passively or fleeing when one partner comes to relieve the other at the nest , males and females use the same display the male employs during courtship ; during changeovers , the birds may also '' yawn '' at each other the adults are also eaten occasionally , as they are rather meaty birds ( comparable to a domestic duck ) ; like other fish-eating birds such as cormorants or seaducks they do not taste particularly good though on the other hand , as evidenced by the etymology of '' anhinga '' detailed above , the tupi seem to have considered the anhinga a kind of bird of ill omen the genus anhinga was introduced by the french zoologist mathurin jacques brisson in 1760 with the anhinga or american darter ( anhinga anhinga ) as the type species anhinga is derived from the tupi ajíŋa ( also transcribed áyinga or ayingá ) , which in local mythology refers to a malevolent demonic forest spirit ; it is often translated as '' devil bird '' while the darters ' lack of many display behaviors is shared with gannets ( and that of a few with cormorants ) , these are all symplesiomorphies that are absent in frigatebirds , tropicbirds and pelicans also whether the pointing display of mates is another synapomorphy of darters and cormorants that was dropped again in some of the latter , or whether it evolved independently in darters and those cormorants that do it , is not clear the male raised-wing display seems to be a synapomorphy of the sulae ; like almost all cormorants and shags but unlike almost all gannets and boobies , darters keep their wrists bent as they lift the wings in display , but their alternating wing-waving , which they also show before take-off , is unique the supposed traits uniting them , like all-webbed toes and a bare gular sac , are now known to be convergent , and pelicans are apparently closer relatives of storks than of the sulae hence , the sulae and the frigatebirds – and some prehistoric relatives – are increasingly separated as the suliformes , which is sometimes dubbed '' phalacrocoraciformes '' there are four living species of darters recognized , all in the genus anhinga , although the old world ones were often lumped together as subspecies of a they may form a superspecies with regard to the more distinct anhinga : olson ( 1985 ) : p.207 , becker ( 1986 ) anhinga or american darter , anhinga anhinga oriental darter or indian darter , anhinga melanogaster african darter , anhinga rufa australasian darter or australian darter , anhinga novaehollandiae extinct '' darters '' from mauritius and australia known only from bones were described as anhinga nana ( '' mauritian darter '' ) and anhinga parva in the former case , however , the remains are larger than those of the geographically closest extant population of long-tailed cormorants on madagascar : they thus might belong to an extinct subspecies ( mauritian cormorant ) , which would have to be called microcarbo africanus nanus ( or phalacrocorax a becker ( 1986 ) , mayr ( 2009 ) : pp.67–70 fossil anhingidae are known since the early miocene ; a number of prehistoric darters similar to those still alive have been described , as well as some more distinct genera now extinct their distinctness has been doubted , but this was due to the supposed '' anhinga '' fraileyi being rather similar to macranhinga , rather than due to them resembling the living species : cione et al ( 2000 ) , alvarenga & guilherme ( 2003 ) meganhinga alvarenga , 1995 ( early miocene of chile ) '' paranavis '' ( middle/late miocene of paraná , argentina ) – a nomen nudum named in a thesis and hence not validly according to iczn rules ( 2000 ) macranhinga noriega , 1992 ( middle/late miocene – late miocene/early pliocene of sc south america ) – may include '' anhinga '' fraileyi giganhinga rinderknecht & noriega , 2002 ( late pliocene/early pleistocene of uruguay ) ; anhinga prehistoric members of anhinga were presumably distributed in similar climates as today , ranging into europe in the hotter and wetter miocene with their considerable stamina and continent-wide distribution abilities ( as evidenced by the anhinga and the old world superspecies ) , the smaller lineage has survived for over 20 ma as evidenced by the fossil species ' biogeography centered around the equator , with the younger species ranging eastwards out of the americas , the hadley cell seems to have been the main driver of the genus ' success and survival : olson ( 1985 ) : p.206 anhinga walterbolesi worthy , 2012 ( late oligocene to early miocene of central australia anhinga subvolans ( brodkorb , 1956 ) ( early miocene of thomas farm , us ) – formerly in phalacrocorax uf 4500 , a proximal right humerus half ( 1998–99 ) , mlíkovský ( 2002 ) : p.74 '' anhinga '' fraileyi campbell , 1996 ( late miocene – ? early pliocene of sc south america ) – may belong in macranhinga holotype lacm 135356 is a slightly damaged right tarsometatarsus ;

apparently distinct from the living genus : campbell ( 1992 ) , alvarenga & guilherme ( 2003 ) anhinga pannonica lambrecht , 1916 ( late miocene of c europe ? and tunisia , east africa , pakistan and thailand – ? sahabi early pliocene of libya ) a cervical vertebra ( the holotype ) and a carpometacarpus ;
