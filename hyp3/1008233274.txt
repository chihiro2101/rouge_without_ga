honey fungus is a '' white rot '' fungus , which is a pathogenic organism that affects trees , shrubs , woody climbers and , rarely , woody herbaceous perennials honey fungus spreads from living trees , dead and live roots and stumps by means of reddish-brown to black rhizomorphs ( root-like structures ) at the rate of approximately a year , but infection by root contact is possible lindner ( 2012 ) and xi taxonomically undescribed nabs i , v , vii , ix , x , and xi have been found in british columbia ; i , iii , v have been found in the prairie provinces , with i and v occurring in both the taiga and montane ecology ; i , iii , v , and vii have been found in ontario ; and i , ii , iii , v , and vi have been found in quebec their caps ( mushroom tops ) are typically yellow-brown , somewhat sticky to touch when moist , and , depending on age , may range in shape from conical to convex to depressed in the center rhizomorphs ( also called mycelial cords ) appear under the bark and around the tree , and mushrooms grow in clusters from the infected plant in autumn and die back after the first frost rhizomorphs grow close to the soil surface ( in the top and invade new roots , or the root collar ( where the roots meet the stem ) of plants potential hosts include conifers and various monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous trees , shrubs , and herbaceous species , ranging from asparagus and strawberry to large forest trees ( patton and vasquez bravo 1967 ) although the relationships among some groups in the genus seem clearer , the investigation of geographically diverse isolates has revealed that the relationship between some north american species is still unclear ( hughes et al reviews of the biology , diversity , pathology , and control of armillaria in fox ( 2000 ) fox , r.t.v the linkage of morphological , genetic , and molecular characters of armillaria over the past few decades has led to the recognition of intersterile groups designated as “ biological species ” new questions remain unanswered regarding the phylogeny of north american armillaria species and their relationships to their european counterparts , particularly within the “ armillaria mellea complex ” reference texts for identification are collins complete british mushrooms and toadstools for the variety of field pictures in it , and roger philips ' mushrooms for the quality of his out of field pictures and descriptions the basidiocarp ( reproductive structure ) of the fungus is a mushroom that grows on wood , typically in small dense clumps or tufts thin sheets of cream colored mycelium , beneath the bark at the base of the trunk or stem indicated that honey fungus is likely the pathogen in norway , few mycologists have started to regard honey fungus as poisonous , because the norway health department is moving away from the parboiling practice
