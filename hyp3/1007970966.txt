he also met andy warhol and roy lichtenstein and , influenced in part by them , made the drastic change to a photorealism style ( morley preferred the phrase superrealist ) the artist also branched out into full-on free-standing sculpture , with one piece , port clyde ( 1990 ) , showing a boat on a window frame , as if referring back to the artist 's lost childhood model of hms nelson similar expressionist brushwork and subject matter by artists such as julian schnabel , eric fischl , georg baselitz , and anselm kiefer resulted in curators identifying a '' neo-expressionism '' movement , in which they included him , although he disliked the label in the last decade of his life , morley continued to depict early- and mid-twentieth-century fighter planes , as well as the pilots who flew them during world wars i and ii , including the legendary flying ace manfred von richthofen , the '' red baron the 1990s saw the artist return to his very early subject matter of large seagoing vessels , often with the addition of fighter planes that he built out of paper , painted with watercolor , and then attached to the surface of the canvas ( resulting in , as he told an interviewer , the pun of a '' three-dimensional plane '' ) '' he would adopt this as his style for a few years , transposing images from a variety of sources ( travel brochures , calendars , old paintings ) to canvas thumb in the 1970s , morley 's work began to be more expressionism , with looser brushwork , and he began to incorporate collage and performance into his work , for example in 1972 , when he was invited to paint a version of raphael 's the school of athens at the state university of new york at potsdam , in front of an audience in the mid-1960s , morley briefly taught at ohio state university , and then moved back to new york city , where he taught at the school of visual arts ( 1967–1969 ) and stony brook university ( 1970–1974 ) the artist also returned to the '' catastrophes '' that were among his early subjects , depicting car crashes ( including one showing the crash that resulted in the death of auto racing star dale earnhardt ) , the aftermath of the war in afghanistan , and the collapse of a building in brooklyn , among other subjects contemporary photojournalism was the subject of the artist 's paintings of the following decade , with motorcycle and car racing , football , skiing , swimming , and horse racing coming in for attention in the painting , the cover of a los angeles phone book is superimposed with a welter of imagery , some of it based on his earlier work ( cruise ships , airplanes ) , and some on painted models , which became a mainstay of his subject matter for the remainder of his career one factor that distinguished morley from his photorealist peers was that rather than painting from the photograph itself , he was painting from printed reproductions such as postcards , sometimes even including the white border around a postcard image or the corporate logo from a calendar page his first solo exhibition was at kornblee gallery in 1964 , partly at the urging of the art dealer ivan karp , who had a reputation as a talent spotter and had worked with the legendary dealer leo castelli at the time of his death morley resided in bellport , new york , where he shared a home with lida morley , his loving and caring wife since 1986
