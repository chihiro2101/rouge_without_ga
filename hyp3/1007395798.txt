the mechanics of the pulsation as a heat-engine was proposed in 1917 by arthur stanley eddington ( who wrote at length on the dynamics of cepheids ) , but it was not until 1953 that s a relationship between the period and luminosity for classical cepheids was discovered in 1908 by henrietta swan leavitt in an investigation of thousands of variable stars in the magellanic clouds at the dimmest part of a cepheid 's cycle , the ionized gas in the outer layers of the star is opaque , and so is heated by the star 's radiation , and due to the increased temperature , begins to expand chief among the uncertainties tied to the classical and type ii cepheid distance scale are : the nature of the period-luminosity relation in various passbands , the impact of metallicity on both the zero-point and slope of those relations , and the effects of photometric contamination ( blending ) and a changing ( typically unknown ) extinction law on cepheid distances delta cephei is also of particular importance as a calibrator of the cepheid period-luminosity relation since its distance is among the most precisely established for a cepheid , partly because it is a member of a star cluster and the availability of precise hubble space telescope/hipparcos parallaxes in 1924 , edwin hubble established the distance to classical cepheid variables in the andromeda galaxy , until then known as the andromeda nebula , and showed that the variables were not members of the milky way however , the eponymous star for classical cepheids is delta cephei , discovered to be variable by john goodricke a few months later classical cepheids ( also known as population i cepheids , type i cepheids , or delta cepheid variables ) undergo pulsations with very regular periods on the order of days to months the accepted explanation for the pulsation of cepheids is called the eddington valve , or '' κ-mechanism '' , where the greek letter κ ( kappa ) is the usual symbol for the gas opacity most of the cepheids were known from the distinctive light curve shapes with the rapid increase in brightness and a hump , but some with more symmetrical light curves were known as geminids after the prototype ζ geminorum the luminosity of type ii cepheids is , on average , less than classical cepheids by about 1.5 magnitudes ( but still brighter than rr lyrae stars ) on september 10 , 1784 , edward pigott detected the variability of eta aquilae , the first known representative of the class of classical cepheid variables in 1879 , arthur ritter demonstrated that the adiabatic radial pulsation period for a homogeneous sphere is related to its surface gravity and radius through the relation : t k \ , \sqrt \frac r g where k is a proportionality constant
