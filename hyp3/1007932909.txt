nothing is securely known of chariton beyond what he states in his novel , which introduces him as '' chariton of aphrodisias , secretary of the rhetor athenagoras '' the name '' chariton '' , which means '' man of graces '' , has been considered a pseudonym chosen to suit the romantic content of his writing , but both '' chariton '' and '' athenagoras '' occur as names on inscriptions from aphrodisias the latest possible date at which chariton could have written is attested in papyri that contain fragments of his work , which can be dated by palaeography to about ad 200 in the 19th century , before the discovery of the papyri , a date as late as the 6th century ad was proposed on stylistic grounds , while a in satire 1 ( lines 124-134 ) , persius suggests that those having a juvenile sense of humor and unsophisticated taste in art and literature should stick to '' the law reports in the morning , and calliroÃ« after lunch there is a funeral , and she is shut up in a tomb , but then it turns out she was only in a coma , and wakes up in time to scare the pirates who have opened the tomb to rob it ; they recover quickly and take her a parallel is in some versions of the myth of abandoned ariadne to sell as a slave in miletus , where her new master , dionysius , falls in love with her and marries her , she being afraid to mention that she is already married ( and pregnant by chaereas ) meanwhile , chaereas has heard she is alive , and has gone looking for her , but is himself captured and enslaved , and yet they both come to the attention of artaxerxes , the great king of persia , who must decide who is her rightful husband , but is thinking about acquiring her for himself much of the novel is told in direct speech , revealing the importance of oratory and rhetorical display ( as in the presentation before the king of persia ) and perhaps as well the influence of new comedy the novel also has some amusing insights into ancient culture ( for instance , the pirates decide to sell callirhoe in miletus rather than in the equally wealthy athens , because they considered athenians to be litigious busybodies who would ask too many questions )
