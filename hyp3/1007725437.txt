the exhibit , featuring over 650 paintings , sculptures , prints , and books from the collections of 32 german museums , premiered in munich on july 19 , 1937 , and remained on view until november 30 , before traveling to 11 other cities in germany and austria for example : insolent mockery of the divine under centrist rule revelation of the jewish racial soul an insult to german womanhood the ideal—cretin and whore deliberate sabotage of national defense german farmers—a yiddish view the jewish longing for the wilderness reveals itself—in germany the negro becomes the racial ideal of a degenerate art madness becomes method nature as seen by sick minds even museum bigwigs called this the '' art of the german people '' barron 1991 , p the supposedly '' jewish '' nature of all art that was indecipherable , distorted , or that represented '' depraved '' subject matter was explained through the concept of degeneracy , which held that distorted and corrupted art was a symptom of an inferior race on june 30 of that year goebbels put adolf ziegler , the head of ( reich chamber of visual art ) , in charge of a six-man commission authorized to confiscate from museums and art collections throughout the reich , any remaining art deemed modern , degenerate , or subversive the exhibit was designed to promote the idea that modernism was a conspiracy by people who hated german decency , frequently identified as jewish-bolshevist , although only 6 of the 112 artists included in the exhibition were in fact jewish hitler 's rise to power on january 31 , 1933 , was quickly followed by actions intended to cleanse the culture of degeneracy : book burnings were organized , artists and musicians were dismissed from teaching positions , and curators who had shown a partiality for modern art were replaced by party members in 2010 , as work began to extend an rapid transit from alexanderplatz through the historic city centre to the brandenburg gate , a number of sculptures from the degenerate art exhibition were unearthed in the cellar of a private house close to the '' rote rathaus '' goebbels and some others believed that the forceful works of such artists as emil nolde , ernst barlach and erich heckel exemplified the nordic spirit ; as goebbels explained , '' we national socialists are not unmodern ; we are the carrier of a new modernity , not only in politics and in social matters , but also in art and intellectual matters its nature and its works ) and ( art and race ) , the latter published in 1928 , in which he argued that only racially pure artists could produce a healthy art which upheld timeless ideals of classical beauty , while racially mixed modern artists produced disordered artworks and monstrous depictions of the human form sub-chambers within the culture chamber , representing the individual arts ( music , film , literature , architecture , and the visual arts ) were created ; these were membership groups consisting of '' racially pure '' artists supportive of the party , or willing to be compliant despite the fact that nordau was jewish and a key figure in the zionist movement ( lombroso was also jewish ) , his theory of artistic degeneracy would be seized upon by german nazis during the weimar republic as a rallying point for their antisemitic and racist demand for aryan purity in art a large amount of '' degenerate art '' by picasso , dalí , ernst , klee , léger and miró was destroyed in a bonfire on the night of july 27 , 1942 , in the gardens of the galerie nationale du jeu de paume in paris those who remained in germany were forbidden to work at university and were subject to surprise raids by the gestapo in order to ensure that they were not violating the ban on producing artwork ; nolde secretly carried on painting , but using only watercolors ( so as not to be betrayed by the telltale odor of oil paint ) 54 by his order , 70 mostly expressionist paintings were removed from the permanent exhibition of the weimar schlossmuseum in 1930 , and the director of the könig albert museum in zwickau , hildebrand gurlitt , was dismissed for displaying modern art a few weeks after the opening of the exhibition , goebbels ordered a second and more thorough scouring of german art collections ; inventory lists indicate that the artworks seized in this second round , combined with those gathered prior to the exhibition , amounted to 16,558 works beginning before world war i , the well-known german architect and painter paul schultze-naumburg 's influential writings , which invoked racial theories in condemning modern art and architecture , supplied much of the basis for adolf hitler 's belief that classical greece and the middle ages were the true sources of aryan art whereas it was forbidden to export '' degenerate art '' to germany , it was still possible to buy and sell artworks of '' degenerate artists '' in occupied france over 5000 works were seized , including 1052 by nolde , 759 by heckel , 639 by ernst ludwig kirchner and 508 by max beckmann , as well as smaller numbers of works by such artists as alexander archipenko , marc chagall , james ensor , albert gleizes , henri matisse , jean metzinger , pablo picasso , and vincent van gogh in the case of germany , the model was to be classical greek and roman art , regarded by hitler as an art whose exterior form embodied an inner racial ideal for many modernist artists , such as max beckmann , ernst ludwig kirchner , and oskar schlemmer , it was not until june 1937 that they surrendered any hope that their work would be tolerated by the authorities belief in a germanic spirit—defined as mystical , rural , moral , bearing ancient wisdom , and noble in the face of a tragic destiny—existed long before the rise of the nazis ; the composer richard wagner celebrated such ideas in his work however , a faction led by alfred rosenberg despised the expressionists , and the result was a bitter ideological dispute , which was settled only in september 1934 , when hitler declared that there would be no place for modernist experimentation in the reich neil levi , writing in the chronicle of higher education , suggested that the branding of art as '' degenerate '' was only partly an aesthetic aim of the nazis nordau developed from this premise a critique of modern art , explained as the work of those so corrupted and enfeebled by modern life that they have lost the self-control needed to produce coherent works in the case of paintings acquired during the post-war weimar hyperinflation of the early 1920s , when the cost of a kilogram loaf of bread reached 233 & nbsp ;

the second featured works by jewish artists in particular ; the third contained works deemed insulting to the women , soldiers and farmers of germany a picasso , a play by jeffrey hatcher based loosely on actual events , is set in paris 1941 and sees picasso being asked to authenticate three works for inclusion in an upcoming exhibition of degenerate art ( in 1937 , it would be displayed in the degenerate art exhibition next to a label accusing dix—himself a volunteer in world war i norbert wolf , uta grosenick ( 2004 ) , expressionism , taschen , p benny goodman and django reinhardt were popular , and leading british and american jazz bands continued to perform in major cities until the war ;
