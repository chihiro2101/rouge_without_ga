after antiochus i succeeded his father as ruler of the seleucid empire in 281 bc , he entrusted the east to his own son , antiochus ii who remained in this position until he in turn succeeded to the throne in 261 bc the literary evidence is as follows : justin says that the rebellion occurred 'around the same time ' as the parni conquest of parthia from the seleucid realm , but his dating of this event is confused—he places it in 256 bc , but during the reign of seleucus ii ( 246-225 bc ) in the wars which followed alexander 's death in 323 bc , the region was largely left to its own devices , but it was incorporated in the seleucid empire by seleucus i between 308 and 305 bc , along with the rest of the territories that alexander had conquered in iran and central asia before diodotus came to power , there was already a mint in bactria—based at ai-khanoum or at bactra , which minted royal coinage in the name of the seleucid sovereign , with the reigning seleucid king 's portrait on the obverse and an image of apollo , the seleucid patron deity , sitting on an omphalus different scholars have argued for a 'high chronology ' which places diodotus ' independence around 255 bc in the reign of antiochus ii , or a 'low chronology ' which dates the secession around 245 bc at the beginning of the reign of seleucus ii the region of bactria , which encompassed the oxus river in modern afghanistan and tajikistan , was conquered by alexander the great between 329 and 327 bc and he settled a number of his veterans in the region these coins have the head of a male figure on the obverse , presumably diodotus himself , shown wearing the diadem—a band of cloth wrapped around the head , with two strips hanging down the back , which had been the standard symbol of hellenistic kingship since the time of alexander the great these coins imitate the original design of the tetradrachms issued by diodotus i , but with a legend on the obverse identifying the king as ( 'of diodotus soter ' ) the wreath was a greek symbol of victory—frank holt suggests that it commemorated a victory over the parthians and that this victory was also the source of diodotus ' epithet soter ( savour ) he probably became seleucid satrap ( governor ) of bactria during antiochus ii 's period in charge of the east , thus about a generation after the original establishment of seleucid control over the region archaeological evidence for the period comes largely from excavations of the city of ai-khanoum , where this period saw the expansion of irrigation networks , the construction and expansion of civic buildings , and some military activity , probably raiding by nomads from the central asian steppe ammianus marcellinus 23.6.2-3 arrian 's lost parthian history seems to have claimed that the seleucid satrap who was overthrown by the parthians was appointed to that position by antiochus ii at some point , diodotus seceded from the seleucid empire , establishing his realm as an independent kingdom , known in modern scholarship as the graeco-bactrian kingdom
