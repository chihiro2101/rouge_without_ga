eve online is a prime example of online game with a vast player-driven economy that , in 2014 , was estimated to have a total virtual value of based on the trading of the in-game currency this created a virtual economy around items in the game , as some rare items , known as '' unusuals '' by the game community due to various special effects applied , and are seen as having high social value , had traded for as high as , and because of the active trading that incorporated real-world money , valve hired economist yanis varoufakis to help manage this many games , both online and off , use a common or standard type of currency that can only be earned in-game and used to spend on in-game items that can not be traded with other players or converted to real-world funds ; for example , by completing quests in world of warcraft , players earn gold pieces that are used to purchase new gear this can be seen , for example , in second life 's recognition of intellectual property rights for assets created '' in-world '' by subscribers , and its laissez-faire policy on the buying and selling of linden dollars ( the world 's official currency ) for real money on third party websites while many game developers , such as blizzard ( creator of world of warcraft ) , prohibit the practice , it is common that goods and services within virtual economies will be sold on online auction sites and traded for real currencies dugger represents a group of gamers that are not in the market for a real house but instead to own a small piece of the vast computer database that was ultima online , the mythical world in which the venerable mmo ultima online unfolds , in a game of monopoly between friends , offering another player a real dollar in exchange for a property on the board ) ; and for this to be necessary or valuable may indicate a kingmaker scenario within the game to control real money trading , eve online created an official and sanctioned method to convert real world cash to in-game currency ; players can use real world money to buy a specific in-game item which can be redeemed for account subscription time or traded on the in-game market for in-game currency a game 's synthetic economy often results in interaction with a '' real '' economy ; characters , currency , and items may be sold and bought on online auction websites or purchased from standalone webshops many mmorpgs such as runescape , world of warcraft , guild wars , warhammer online , lord of the rings online and final fantasy xi strictly prohibit buying gold , items , or any other product linked with the game , with real world cash a 2007 virtual heist has led to calls from some community members in second life to bring in external regulation of these markets : '' in late july , a perpetrator with privileged information cracked a stock exchange 's computers , made false deposits , then ran off with what appears to be the equivalent of us 10,000 , disappearing into thin air if ( for example ) a magic sword is considered to have real-world value , a player who kills a powerful monster to earn such a sword could find himself being charged tax on the value of the sword , as would be normal for a '' prize winning '' the '' real money auction house '' ( rmah ) , as it is called by the diablo iii fanbase , will exist in the presence of a parallel auction house wherein items are exchanged for gold , the in-game currency such trading of real money for virtual goods simply represents the development of virtual economies where people come together where the real and the synthetic worlds are meeting within an economic sphere in spite of numerous famed examples of the economic growth of second life an amateur analyst in 2008 estimated the income inequity in second life 's economy as worse than has ever been recorded in any real economy : a gini coefficient of 90.2 , a hoover index of 77.8 , and a theil index of 91 % if the currency in second life , the linden dollars , can be easily acquired with real money , the reverse is done through a market place owned by linden lab , but is not guaranteed , as the tos of linden lab explicitly says that linden dollars are not redeemable in south korea , where the number of video game players is massive , some have reported the emergence of gangs and mafia , where powerful players would threaten beginners to give money for their '' protection '' , and actually steal and rob however , the secondary market is unlikely to have followed the growth of the primary market since 2007 seeing as game companies have become better at monetizing on their games with microtransactions and many popular games such as world of warcraft are sporting increased measures against player to player real money trading since a developer may change the virtual world any time , ban a player , delete items , or even simply take the world down never to return , the issue of their responsibility in the case where real money investments are lost through items being lost or becoming inaccessible is significant since players of these games are willing to substitute real economic resources of time and money ( monthly fees ) in exchange for these resources , by definition they have demonstrated utility to the user '' so to avoid regulation by these laws , the '' operator would need to take reasonable steps to ensure that the rewards they give do not have a monetary value , '' possibly by demonstrating enforcement of their terms of service prohibiting secondary markets virtual real estate is earning real world money , with people like 43-year-old wonder bread deliveryman , john dugger , purchasing a virtual real estate for 750 , setting him back more than a weeks wages during an interview with virtual world news , alex chapman of the british law firm campbell hooper stated : '' now we ’ ve spoken with the gambling commission , and they ’ ve said that mmogs aren ’ t the reason for the , but they won ’ t say outright , and we ’ ve asked directly , that they won ’ t be covered however , as counter-strike gained favor as an esport , these skins became part of a larger skin gambling scheme , where grey market websites , integrated with steam 's features , could allow players to use skins to gamble on the results of counter-strike esport events , and later just using skins to play game of chance once premium currency is purchased , it is rare for players to be able to revert the premium currency , or the goods purchased with it , back into real-world funds , making it a '' one-way currency '' premium currency typically is limited to purchase time-limited virtual goods , access to new characters or levels , temporary boosts to the player-character 's experience growth , or other goods that can not be acquired with the common in-game currency most commonly , premium currency must be purchased through microtransactions in bundles of fixed sizes with discounts for larger purchases , and do not allow players to purchase exactly the amount of premium currency they need for a virtual good such games offer the means for players to acquire in-game resources which players may then sell or trade with other players , craft into gear which can be sell or traded , and otherwise create an virtual marketplace within the game above and beyond in-game stores established by the developer however , the application of these economic measures to a virtual world may be inappropriate where poverty is merely virtual and there is a direct relationship between in-game wealth and time spent playing in the game the sims online , a 17-year-old boy going by the in-game name '' evangeline '' was discovered to have built a cyber-brothel , where customers would pay sim-money for minutes of cybersex according to standard conceptions of economic value ( see the economic subjectivism ) , the goods and services of virtual economies do have a demonstrable value in 2001 , everquest players brock pierce and alan debonneville founded internet gaming entertainment ltd ( ige ) , a company that offered not only the virtual commodities in exchange for real money but also provided professional customer service virtual economies can also exist in browser-based internet games where '' real '' money can be spent and user-created shops opened , or as a kind of emergent gameplay on a number of discussion and networking sites , such as slashdot , reddit , care2 and yahoo ! answers , points are gained through the trust metric ; however , as stated by slashdot co-founder cmdrtaco , his implementation of user moderation was not intended as a currency , even though it has evolved on other discussion-oriented sites into such a system for example , south korea is estimated to have the biggest share of the global real money trading market and it has there become an officially acknowledged and taxable part of the economy these emergent economies are considered by most players to be an asset of the game , giving an extra dimension of reality to play however , such rules of etiquette need not apply , and in practice they often do n't , to massive game worlds with thousands of players who know one another only through the game system virtual economies also exist in life simulation games which may have taken the most radical steps toward linking a virtual economy with the real world
