osborn be the green goblin again , or create yet another green goblin the hobgoblin 's identity was not initially revealed , generating one of the longest-running mysteries in the spider-man comics in order to throw off the scent and in the same stroke provide a retroactive continuity for his inconsistent characterization of kingsley in his early appearances , stern came up with the idea of kingsley having his brother daniel kingsley sometimes impersonate him , sealing the deception by having the hobgoblin conspicuously appear in the same room as kingsley in amazing spider-man 249 stern 's original plan was to have the hobgoblin 's mystery identity run exactly one issue longer than that of the green goblin 's identity , meaning the truth would be revealed in the amazing spider-man 264 through both stern and defalco 's runs , mystery answer was continuously teased on the cover art , with the covers of amazing spider-man 245 , 251 , and 276 all showing spider-man unmasking the

reveal the hobgoblin 's identity as the foreigner though the hobgoblin 's posthumous unmasking as leeds was unpopular with fans , david said in a 2009 interview of still being proud of the story , arguing that the hobgoblin being unmasked in a climactic battle with spider-man was the sort of tale readers had already seen countless times before , whereas having an archvillain unmasked in a flashback after having been brutally killed by nameless assassins was unprecedented and shocking in addition to power over hellfire and increased strength and speed to far greater than that of the original hobgoblin , these powers also disfigure macendale so that his head is even more grotesque than the hobgoblin mask , and ultimately alters his mind so that he was deluded into thinking that his appearance is normal stern was unhappy with the hobgoblin 's civilian identity revelation was leeds and wrote the three-issue miniseries spider-man : hobgoblin lives in 1997 , with the retcon that kingsley was the original hobgoblin while leeds was brainwashed into serving as a fall guy , macendale is killed off , and kingsley returned according to stern , initially he had not known how to resolve the situation of having two hobgoblins , and it was at the suggestion of the editorial staff that kingsley kill macendale and return to operating as the hobgoblin spider-man : hobgoblin lives

urich ( who once used the green goblin identity to operate as a superhero ) took on the hobgoblin identity himself as a supervillain with some new gear ( new body armor , a winged jetpack , and a
