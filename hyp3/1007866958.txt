after losing the thirteen colonies , a significant part of british america , in the american revolution , britain turned towards asia , the pacific and later africa with subsequent exploration leading to the rise of the second british empire ( 1783â€“1815 ) from the end of the napoleonic wars in 1815 until world war i in 1914 , the united kingdom played the role of global hegemon ( most powerful actor ) for what purpose was it conquered and is it now retained ? ' we endeavoured to explain , that during the wars , in which we were lately engaged with our european enemies who occupied the coast of the island , they harassed our commerce from its ports , and therefore , in self-defence , there was a necessity for taking possession of it the global superiority of british military and commerce was aided by a divided and relatively weak continental europe , and the presence of the royal navy on all of the world 's oceans and seas the slave trade act 1807 had banned the trade across the british empire , after which the royal navy established the west africa squadron and the government negotiated international treaties under which they could enforce the ban taylor says that this '' was a great event ; indeed , the only real event in international relations between the battle of sedan and the defeat of russia in the russo-japanese war '' it not only gave the british security for their route to india ; it made them masters of the eastern mediterranean and the middle east ; it made it unnecessary for them to stand in the front line against russia at the straits.and thus prepared the way for the franco-russian alliance ten years later the growth of british imperial strength was further underpinned by the steamboat and the telegraph , new technologies invented in the second half of the 19th century , allowing it to control and defend the empire relations between the great powers of europe were strained to breaking point by issues such as the decline of the ottoman empire , which led to the crimean war , and later the emergence of new nation states in the form of italy and germany after the franco-prussian war the industrialisation of germany , the empire of japan , and the united states contributed to the relative decline of british industrial supremacy in the late 19th century however , the british empire remained the biggest colonial empire until the start of decolonization after world war ii ended in 1945 and britain remained one of the leading powers until the suez canal crisis in 1956 during which british and french troops were forced to withdraw from egypt under pressure from the united states and soviet union
