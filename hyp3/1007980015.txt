although the spread of buddhism to central asia and northern asia is usually associated with the kushans , a century or two later , there is a possibility that it may have been introduced in those areas from gandhara '' even earlier , during the time of demetrius and menander '' ( puri , '' buddhism in central asia '' ) from that time , menander and his successors may have been the key propagators of buddhist ideas and representations : '' the spread of gandhari buddhism may have been stimulated by menander 's royal patronage , as may have the development and spread of gandharan sculpture , which seems to have accompanied it '' ( mcevilley , '' the shape of ancient thought '' , p altogether , the conversion of menander to buddhism suggested by the milinda panha seems to have triggered the use of buddhist symbolism in one form or another on the coinage of close to half of the kings who succeeded him an indo-chinese tradition also explains that nagasena , also known as menander 's buddhist teacher , created in 43 bc in the city of pataliputra a statue of the buddha , the emerald buddha , which was later brought to thailand in this scenario , menander was briefly succeeded by his son thrason , of whom a single coin is known paropamisadae and pushkalavati were taken over by zoilos i , perhaps because some of agathokleia 's subjects may have been reluctant to accept an infant king with a queen regent tarn and bopearachchi , is that menander was succeeded by his queen agathokleia , who acted as regent to their infant son strato i until he became an adult and took over the crown another possibility is that just as the indo-greeks routinely represented philosophers in statues ( but certainly not on coins ) in antiquity , the indo-greek may have initiated anthropomorphic representations of the buddha in statuary only , possibly as soon as the 2nd-1st century bc , as advocated by foucher and suggested by chinese murals depicting emperor wu of han worshipping buddha statues brought from central asia in 120 bc ( see picture ) menander 's dynasty was thus dethroned and did not return to power until later , though his relative nicias may have ruled a small principality in the kabul valley in classical antiquity , from at least the 1st century , the '' menander mons '' , or '' mountains of menander '' , came to designate the mountain chain at the extreme east of the indian subcontinent , today 's naga hills and arakan , as indicated in the ptolemy world map of the 1st century geographer ptolemy
