the european union have also set a similar limit for users of personal listening devices ( 80 & nbsp ; db ( a ) for no more than 40 hours per week ) and for each additional increase of 3-db in sound exposure , the duration should be cut in half ( 83 & nbsp ; db ( a ) for no more than 20 hours , 86 & nbsp ; db ( a ) for 10 hours per week , 89 & nbsp ; db ( a ) for 5 hours per week and so on active noise-cancelling headphones use a microphone , amplifier , and speaker to pick up , amplify , and play ambient noise in phase-reversed form ; this to some extent cancels out unwanted noise from the environment without affecting the desired sound source , which is not picked up and reversed by the microphone this type combines advantages of earbuds and in-ear headphones – depending on the environment and requirements of the user , they provide passive noise reduction for quality mode ( conversation or active music listening ) or they give control over the sound environment around user in comfort mode ( stand by or background voice/music listening ) in contrast , the american occupational safety and health administration recommends an average spl of no more than 85 & nbsp ; db ( a ) to avoid long-term hearing loss , while the european union standard en 50332-1:2013 recommends that volumes above 85 & nbsp ; db ( a ) include a warning , with an absolute maximum volume ( defined using 40–4,000 & nbsp ; hz noise ) of no more than 100 & nbsp ; db to avoid accidental hearing damage headphones are also useful for video games that use 3d positional audio processing algorithms , as they allow players to better judge the position of an off-screen sound source ( such as the footsteps of an opponent or their gunfire ) the microphone arm of headsets is either an external microphone type where the microphone is held in front of the user 's mouth , or a voicetube type where the microphone is housed in the earpiece and speech reaches it by means of a hollow tube extended periods of exposure to high sound pressure levels created by headphones at high volume settings may be damaging to hearing ; nearly 50 % of teenagers and young adults ( 12 to 35 years old ) in middle and high income countries listen to unsafe levels of sound on their personal audio devices and smartphones using this standard , headphones with sensitivities of 90 , 100 and 110 & nbsp ; db ( spl ) /v should be driven by an amplifier capable of no more than 3.162 , 1.0 and 0.3162 rms volts at maximum volume setting , respectively to reduce the risk of hearing damage during the calibration process , the output signal from the audiometer to the headphones is measured with a sound level meter to ensure that the signal is accurate to the reading on the audiometer for sound pressure level and frequency various types of specially designed headphones or earphones are also used to evaluate the status of the auditory system in the field of audiology for establishing hearing thresholds , medically diagnosing hearing loss , identifying other hearing related disease , and monitoring hearing status in occupational hearing conservation programs while a loudspeaker must use a relatively large ( often 15 '' or 18 '' ) speaker driver to reproduce low frequencies , headphones can accurately reproduce bass and sub-bass frequencies with speaker drivers only 40-50 millimeters wide ( or much smaller , as is the case with in-ear monitor headphones ) the 3.5 & nbsp ; mm radio and phone connector , which is the most commonly used in portable application today , has been used at least since the sony efm-117j transistor radio , which was released in 1964 to ensure an even frequency response , adequate damping factor , and undistorted sound , an amplifier should have an output impedance less than 1/8 that of the headphones it is driving ( and ideally , as low as possible ) a voice coil , a light coil of wire , is suspended in the magnetic field of the magnet , attached to a diaphragm , typically fabricated from lightweight , high-stiffness-to-mass-ratio cellulose , polymer , carbon material , paper or the like for example , for a headphone with a sensitivity of 100 & nbsp ; db ( spl ) /v , an amplifier with an output of 1 root mean square ( rms ) voltage produces a maximum volume of 100 & nbsp ; db where the open-back approach has hardly any measure to block sound at the outer side of the diaphragm and the closed-back approach really has a closed chamber at the outer side of the diaphragm , a semi-open headphone can have a chamber to partially block sound while letting some sound through via openings or vents such a chip is composed of a layer of cnt thin yarn array supported by the silicon wafer , and periodic grooves with certain depth are made on the wafer by micro-fabrication methods to suppress the heat leakage from the cnt yarn to the substrate thumb in-ear headphones , also known as in-ear monitors ( iems ) or canalphones , are small headphones with similar portability to earbuds that are inserted in the ear canal itself in addition , a special amplifier is required to amplify the signal to deflect the membrane , which often requires electrical potentials in the range of 100 to 1,000 & nbsp ; volts as the impedance of a pair of headphones increases , more voltage ( at a given current ) is required to drive it , and the loudness of the headphones for a given voltage decreases although modern headphones have been particularly widely sold and used for listening to stereo recordings since the release of the walkman , there is subjective debate regarding the nature of their reproduction of stereo sound lack of sound from the environment can be a problem when sound is a necessary cue for safety or other reasons , as when walking , driving , or riding near or in vehicular traffic by the 1890s the first device that is unmistakably a headphone was made by a british company called electrophone created a system allowing their customers to connect into live feeds of performances at theaters and opera houses across london as the output voltage ( but not power ) of a headphone amplifier is essentially constant for most common headphones , db/mw is often more useful if converted into db/v using ohm 's law : : \mathrm alternatively , online calculators can be used this has the additional undesirable effect of being dependent of the efficiency of the headphones ; a device producing the maximum allowed power may not produce adequate volume when paired with low-efficiency , high-impedance equipment , while the same amount of power can reach dangerous levels with very efficient earphones headphones can prevent other people from hearing the sound , either for privacy or to prevent disturbing others , as in listening in a public library in the professional audio sector , headphones are used in live situations by disc jockeys with a dj mixer , and sound engineers for monitoring signal sources for older models of telephones , the headset microphone impedance is different from that of the original handset , requiring a telephone amplifier for the telephone headset supra-aural headphones can also lead to discomfort due to the pressure on the ear as compared to circumaural headphones that sit around the ear some noise cancelling headphones are designed mainly to reduce low-frequency engine and travel noise in aircraft , trains , and automobiles , and are less effective in environments with other types of noise when these new improved electrets are combined with a traditional dome headphone driver , headphones can be produced that are recognised by the japan audio society as worthy of joining the hi res audio program when the varying current of an audio signal is passed through the coil , it creates a varying magnetic field that reacts against the static magnetic field , exerting a varying force on the coil causing it and the attached diaphragm to vibrate due to the extremely thin and light diaphragm membrane , often only a few micrometers thick , and the complete absence of moving metalwork , the frequency response of electrostatic headphones usually extends well above the audible limit of approximately 20 & nbsp ; khz as illustrated in the second diagram , when there is electric current through the coil , it magnetizes the armature one way or the other , causing it to rotate slightly one way or the other about the pivot thus moving the diaphragm to make sound both circumaural and supra-aural headphones can be further differentiated by the type of earcups : open-back headphones have the back of the earcups open instead , they receive a radio or infrared signal encoded using a radio or infrared transmission link , such as fm , bluetooth or wi-fi passive noise isolation is essentially using the body of the earphone , either over or in the ear , as a passive earplug that simply blocks out sound in radio studios , djs use a pair of headphones when talking to the microphone while the speakers are turned off to eliminate acoustic feedback while monitoring their own voice it is possible to change the spatial effects of stereo sound on headphones , to better approximate the presentation of speaker reproduction , by using frequency-dependent cross-feed between the channels because specific headphones are used in the initial audiometer calibration process , they can not be replaced with any other set of headphones , even from the same make and model unwanted sound from the environment can be reduced by excluding sound from the ear by passive noise isolation , or , often in conjunction with isolation , by active noise cancellation binaural recordings use a different microphone technique to encode direction directly as phase , with very little amplitude difference below 2 & nbsp ; khz , often using a dummy head ( the use of the term earbuds , which has been around since at least 1984 , did not hit its peak until after 2001 , with the success of apple 's mp3 player smaller earbud type earpieces , which plugged into the user 's ear canal , were first developed for hearing aids headsets are made with either a single-earpiece ( mono ) or a double-earpiece ( mono to both ears or stereo ) earphones are very small headphones that are fitted directly in the outer ear , facing but not inserted in the ear canal a telephone amplifier provides basic pin-alignment similar to a telephone headset adaptor , but it also offers sound amplifier for the microphone as well as the loudspeakers electrostatic headphones require a voltage source generating 100 & nbsp ; v to over 1 & nbsp ; kv , and are on the user 's head circum-aural earphones are also used to establish hearing thresholds in the extended high frequency range ( 8,000 & nbsp ; hz to 20,000 & nbsp ; khz ) niosh published several documents targeted at protecting the hearing of workers who must wear communication headsets such as call center operators , firefighters , and musicians and sound engineers . the high-frequency response means that the low-midband distortion level is maintained to the top of the audible frequency band , which is generally not the case with moving coil drivers this is particularly helpful in situations where the ears must be unobstructed , or for people who are deaf for reasons that do n't affect the nervous apparatus of hearing the electrical sound signal is applied to the electrodes creating an electrical field ; depending on the polarity of this field , the diaphragm is drawn towards one of the plates
