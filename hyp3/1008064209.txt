oedipus recognizes this as a sign , for when he received the prophecy that he would kill his father and marry his mother , apollo also revealed to him that at the end of his life he would die at a place sacred to the furies and be a blessing for the land in which he is buried furthermore , he asks to see their king , theseus , saying , '' i come as someone sacred , someone filled with piety and power , bearing a great gift for all your people 300 the chorus is amazed and decides to reserve their judgment of oedipus until theseus , king of athens , arrives ismene tells her father that it is creon 's plan to come for him and bury him at the border of thebes , without proper burial rites , so that the power which the oracle says his grave will have will not be granted to any other land after he relates his sorrowful story to them , theseus enters , and in contrast to the prying chorus states , '' i know all about you , son of laius 318 he sympathizes with oedipus and offers him unconditional aid , causing oedipus to praise theseus and offer him the gift of his burial site , which will ensure victory in a future conflict with thebes theseus protests , saying that the two cities are friendly , and oedipus responds with what is perhaps the most famous speech in the play creon , who is the representative of thebes , comes to oedipus and feigns pity for him and his children , telling him that he should return to thebes 341 creon replies by condemning oedipus , saying '' i knew your city would never harbor a father-killer.worse , a creature so corrupt , exposed as the mate , the unholy husband of his own mother theseus then informs oedipus that a suppliant has come to the temple of poseidon and wishes to speak with him ; it is oedipus 's son polynices , who has been banished from thebes by his brother eteocles oedipus does not want to talk to him , saying that he loathes the sound of his voice , but antigone persuades him to listen , saying , '' many other men have rebellious children , quick tempers too.but they listen to reason , they relent he knows that this is the result of oedipus 's curse on his sons and begs his father to relent , even going so far as to say to his father , '' we share the same fate when the messenger turned back to look at the spot where oedipus last stood , he says , '' we could n't see the man—he was gone—nowhere ! and the king , alone , shielding his eyes , both hands spread out against his face as if some terrible wonder flashed before his eyes and he , he could not bear to look here , oedipus discusses his fate as related by the oracle , and claims that he is not fully guilty because his crimes of murder and incest were committed in ignorance despite being blinded and exiled and facing violence from creon and his sons , in the end oedipus is accepted and absolved by zeus this certainly affected the way that early audiences reacted to the play , just as the invasion of athens and its diminished power surely affected sophocles as he wrote it thebes is often used in athenian dramas as a city in which proper boundaries and identities are not maintained , allowing the playwright to explore themes like incest , murder , and hubris in a safe setting while the two other plays about oedipus often bring up the theme of a person 's moral responsibility for their destiny , and whether it is possible to rebel against destiny , oedipus at colonus shows oedipus 's resolution of the problem in '' oedipus rex , '' he was told by tiresias , '' you bear your fate and i will bear mine , '' a message repeated by the chorus , but scorned by oedipus , who like his father has believed he can escape his fate in '' oedipus at colonus , '' he declares that even though fate , which literally means '' necessity '' in ancient greek , is something we must suffer as beyond our choice in its power of necessity and is not a person 's creation , we must also find a way to work with it the key line in the play is when oedipus declares , '' let us not fight necessity , '' and antigone adds , '' for you will never see in all the world a man whom god has let escape his destiny ! '' oedipus at colonus suggests that , in breaking divine law , a ruler 's limited understanding may lead him to believe himself fully innocent ; however , his lack of awareness does not change the objective fact of his guilt darice birge has argued that oedipus at colonus can be interpreted as a heroic narrative of oedipus rather than a tragic one it can be viewed as a transitional piece from the oedipus of oedipus rex whose acts were abominable to the oedipus we see at the end of oedipus at colonus , who is so powerful that he is sought after by two separate major cities at the beginning of the play , oedipus has to be led through the grove by antigone and is only allowed to go through it because as a holy place it is an asylum for beggars he has given up his habit of trying to fight divine will ( as was his wont in oedipus rex ) and now is no longer fighting prophecies , but is accepting this grove as the place of his death ismene furthers oedipus ' status as a hero when she performs a libation to the erinyes , but his status is fully cemented when he chooses a hidden part of the sacred grove as his final resting place , which even his daughters ca n't know ioannis gryparis broadway adaptation , 1976 , with alexis minotis as oedipus don taylor 's 1986 television adaptation starring anthony quayle and juliet stevenson lee breuer and bob telson , the gospel at colonus , 1986 patrick stewart and tim philip-smith , bbc radio 4 play justin fleming , child of the dark sun , 2016 ( 2016 ) , '' sophocles ' oedipus in mentis bostantzoglou 's medea '' in greek in mastrapas , a
