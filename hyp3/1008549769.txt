for example , following a run of 10 heads on a flip of a fair coin ( a rare , extreme event ) , regression to the mean states that the next run of heads will likely be less than 10 , while the law of large numbers states that in the long term , this event will likely average out , and the average fraction of heads will tend to 1/2 galton coined the term '' regression '' to describe an observable fact in the inheritance of multi-factorial quantitative genetic traits : namely that the offspring of parents who lie at the tails of the distribution will tend to lie closer to the centre , the mean , of the distribution in this formalization , the joint distribution of x 1 and x 2 is said to exhibit reversion toward the mean if , for every number c , we have : & mu ; & nbsp ; ≤ & nbsp ; ex 2 & nbsp ; & nbsp ; x 1 & nbsp ; > & nbsp ; c & nbsp ; 1 & nbsp ; & nbsp ; x 1 & nbsp ; > & nbsp ; c , and : & mu ; & nbsp ; ≥ & nbsp ; ex 2 & nbsp ; & nbsp ; x 1 & nbsp ; & nbsp ; ex 1 & nbsp ; & nbsp ; x 1 & nbsp ; < & nbsp ; c this definition is '' general '' in the sense that every bivariate distribution with identical marginal distributions exhibits reversion toward the mean for example , if one looks at the batting average of major league baseball players in one season , those whose batting average was above the league mean tend to regress downward toward the mean the following year , while those whose batting average was below the mean tend to progress upward toward the mean the following year so for extreme individuals , we expect the second score to be closer to the mean than the first score , but for all individuals , we expect the distribution of distances from the mean to be the same on both sets of measurements if there were no luck ( good or bad ) or random guessing involved in the answers supplied by the students – then all students would be expected to score the same on the second test as they scored on the original test , and there would be no regression toward the mean in contrast , the term '' regression to the mean '' is now often used to describe the phenomenon by which an initial sampling bias may disappear as new , repeated , or larger samples display sample means that are closer to the true underlying population mean hence the conditional expected value of y , given that x is t standard deviations above its mean ( and that includes the case where it 's below its mean , when t & nbsp ; chernick & friis ( 2003 ) hence , if 0 & nbsp ; ≤ & nbsp ; r & nbsp ; let x 1 , x 2 be random variables with identical marginal distributions with mean μ in the contrary situation , when one happens to perform high above average , their performance will also tend to return to their average level later on ; the change will be perceived as a deterioration and any initial praise following the first performance as a cause of that deterioration suppose the tendency of extreme individuals is to regress 10 % of the way toward the mean of 80 , so a student who scored 100 the first day is expected to score 98 the second day , and a student who scored 70 the first day is expected to score 71 the second day if one medical trial suggests that a particular drug or treatment is outperforming all other treatments for a condition , then in a second trial it is more likely that the outperforming drug or treatment will perform closer to the mean the next quarter and if we compare the best student on the first day to the best student on the second day , regardless of whether it is the same individual or not , there is a tendency to regress toward the mean going in either direction similarly , regression towards the mean is an explanation for the sports illustrated cover jinx — periods of exceptional performance which results in a cover feature are likely to be followed by periods of more mediocre performance , giving the impression that appearing on the cover causes an athlete 's decline as in many cases involving statistics and public policy , the issue is debated , but '' improvement scores '' were not announced in subsequent years and the findings appear to be a case of regression to the mean if its parents are each two inches taller than the averages for men and women , then , on average , the offspring will be shorter than its parents by some factor ( which , today , we would call one minus the regression analysis ) times two inches since then , the term '' regression '' has taken on a variety of meanings , and it may be used by modern statisticians to describe phenomena of sampling bias which have little to do with galton 's original observations in the field of genetics to the extent that a score is determined randomly , or that a score has random variation or error , as opposed to being determined by the student 's academic ability or being a '' true value '' , the phenomenon will have an effect an extreme example is horace secrist 's 1933 book the triumph of mediocrity in business , in which the statistics professor collected mountains of data to prove that the profit rates of competitive businesses tend toward the average over time such a decision was a mistake , because regression toward the mean is not based on cause and effect , but rather on random error in a natural distribution around a mean this will seem as an improvement and as '' proof '' of a belief that it is better to criticize than to praise ( held especially by anyone who is willing to criticize at that '' low '' moment ) but the loci which carry these mutations are not necessarily shared between two tall individuals , and if these individuals mate , their offspring will be on average homozygous for '' tall '' mutations on fewer loci than either of their parents if your favourite sports team won the championship last year , what does that mean for their chances for winning next season ? to the extent this result is due to skill ( the team is in good condition , with a top coach , etc because popular lore has focused on regression toward the mean as an account of declining performance of athletes from one season to the next , it has usually overlooked the fact that such regression can also account for improved performance it has frequently been observed that the worst performers on the first day will tend to improve their scores on the second day , and the best performers on the first day will tend to do worse on the second day for height , galton estimated this coefficient to be about 2/3 : the height of an individual will measure around a midpoint that is two thirds of the parents ' deviation from the population average the baseball player with the highest batting average by the all-star break is more likely to have a lower average than a higher average over the second half of the season some of the lucky students on the first test will be lucky again on the second test , but more of them will have ( for them ) average or below average scores in addition , height is not entirely genetically determined , but also subject to environmental influences during development , which make offspring of exceptional parents even more likely to be closer to the average than their parents however , statisticians have pointed out that , although there is a net benefit in lives saved , failure to take into account the effects of regression to the mean results in the beneficial effects being overstated in no sense does the future event '' compensate for '' or '' even out '' the previous event , though this is assumed in the gambler 's fallacy ( and the variant law of averages )
