with the foundation of the ancient universities from the late 12th century , grammar schools became the entry point to a liberal arts education , with latin seen as the foundation of the trivium three of the first schools independent of the church – winchester college ( 1382 ) , oswestry school ( 1407 ) and eton college ( 1440 ) – were closely tied to the universities ; they were boarding schools , so they could educate pupils from anywhere in the nation mason , the borough of bridgnorth 1157–1957 ( bridgnorth , 1957 ) , 12 , 36 during the english reformation in the 16th century , most cathedral schools were closed and replaced by new foundations funded from the dissolution of the monasteries in theory these schools were open to all and offered free tuition to those who could not pay fees ; however , few poor children attended school , because their labour was economically valuable to their families in the scottish reformation schools such as the high school of glasgow ( founded 1124 ) and the royal high school ( edinburgh ) ( 1128 ) passed from church control to burgh councils , and the burghs also founded new schools during the 16th and 17th centuries the setting-up of grammar schools became a common act of charity by nobles , wealthy merchants and guilds ; for example the crypt school , gloucester , founded by john and joan cook in 1539 , spalding grammar school , founded by john gamlyn and john blanche in 1588 , and blundell 's school , founded in 1604 by wealthy tiverton merchant peter blundell the younger boys learned the parts of speech and latin words in the first year , learned to construct latin sentences in the second year , and began translating english-latin and latin-english passages in the third year in scotland , the burgh councils updated the curricula of their schools so that scotland no longer has grammar schools in any of the senses discussed here , though some , such as aberdeen grammar school , retain the name in england , urban middle-class pressure for a commercial curriculum was often supported by the school 's trustees ( who would charge the new students fees ) , but resisted by the schoolmaster , supported by the terms of the original endowment after 10 years , lord eldon , then lord chancellor , ruled in 1805 , '' there is no authority for thus changing the nature of the charity , and filling a school intended for the purpose of teaching greek and latin with scholars learning the german and french languages , mathematics , and anything except greek and latin however it should be borne in mind that the decline of the grammar schools in england and wales was not uniform and that until the foundation of st bees clerical college , in 1817 , and st david 's college lampeter , in 1828 , specialist grammar schools in the north-west of england and south wales were in effect providing tertiary education to men in their late teens and early twenties , which enabled them to be ordained as anglican clergymen without going to university the grammar schools act 1840 made it lawful to apply the income of grammar schools to purposes other than the teaching of classical languages , but change still required the consent of the schoolmaster at the same time , the national schools were reorganising themselves along the lines of thomas arnold 's reforms at rugby school , and the spread of the railways led to new boarding schools teaching a broader curriculum , such as marlborough college ( 1843 ) modelled on the clarendon commission , which led to the public schools act 1868 which restructured the trusts of nine leading schools ( including eton college , harrow school and shrewsbury school ) , the taunton commission was appointed to examine the remaining 782 endowed grammar schools in the victorian era there was a great emphasis on the importance of self-improvement , and parents keen for their children to receive a decent education organised the creation of new schools with modern curricula , though often retaining a classical core the 1944 education act created the first nationwide system of state-funded secondary education in england and wales , echoed by the education ( northern ireland ) act 1947 one of the three types of school forming the tripartite system was called the grammar school , which sought to spread the academic ethos of the existing grammar schools there were also 179 direct-grant grammar schools , which took between one quarter and one-half of their pupils from the state system , and the rest from fee-paying parents the most famous example of a direct-grant grammar was manchester grammar school , whose headmaster , lord james of rusholme , was one of the most outspoken advocates of the tripartite system in contrast , very few students at secondary modern schools took public examinations until the introduction of the less academic and less prestigious certificate of secondary education ( known as the cse ) in the 1960s according to anthony sampson , in his book anatomy of britain ( 1965 ) , there were structural problems within the testing process that underpinned the eleven plus which meant it tended to result in secondary modern schools being overwhelmingly dominated by the children of poor and working-class parents , while grammar schools were dominated by the children of wealthier middle-class parents anatomy of britain today , london : hodder and stoughton , 1965 , p.195 the tripartite system was largely abolished in england and wales between 1965 , with the issue of circular 10/65 , and the education act 1976 most maintained grammar schools were amalgamated with a number of other local schools , to form neighbourhood comprehensive schools , though a few were closed of the direct grant schools remaining at that time , 51 became comprehensive , 119 opted for independence , and five were '' not accepted for the maintained system and expected to become independent schools or to close '' by the end of the 1980s , all of the grammar schools in wales and most of those in england had closed or converted the tripartite system of grammar and secondary modern schools does survive in a few areas , such as kent , where the eleven-plus examination to divide children into grammar and secondary modern schools is known as the kent test today , '' grammar school '' commonly refers to one of the 163 remaining fully selective state-funded schools in england and the 69 remaining in northern ireland in other areas , grammar schools survive mainly as very highly selective schools in an otherwise comprehensive county , for example in several of the outer boroughs of london although many on the left argue that the existence of selective schools undermines the comprehensive structure , labour governments have delegated decisions on grammar schools to local processes , which have not yet resulted in any changes moreover , government education policy appears to accept the existence of some kind of hierarchy in secondary education , with specialist schools , beacon schools , academies and similar initiatives proposed as ways of raising standards attempts to move to a comprehensive system ( as in the rest of the united kingdom ) have been delayed by shifts in the administration of northern ireland since the '' open enrolment '' reform of 1989 , these schools ( unlike those in england ) have been required to accept pupils up to their capacity , which has also increased unionists tend to lean towards preserving the grammar schools as they are , with academic selection at the age of 11 , whereas nationalist politicians lean towards scrapping the 11-plus , despite vehement protestations from the majority of catholic grammar schools , most notably by the board of governors at rathmore grammar school in finaghy , ( a south belfast suburb ) and lumen christi ( although co-educational ) in derry with the exception of the non-denominational sydney grammar school ( 1857 ) and queensland grammar schools , all the grammar schools established in the 19th century were attached to the church of england ( now the anglican church of australia ) in the 1920s grammar schools of other denominations were established , including members of the associated grammar schools of victoria , mccallum ( 1990 ) , p the new south wales public education system operates 19 selective public schools which resemble the english grammar-school system insofar as they engage in academic selection by way of centralised examination , they do not charge tuition fees and they are recipients of a greater degree of public funding per pupil than is afforded to non-selective government schools the first lieutenant-governor of upper canada , john graves simcoe , advocated grammar schools for the colony to save the wealthy from sending their sons to the united states to be educated , but was unable to convince his superiors in london after several abortive attempts to raise funding , the district schools act of 1807 provided support for one grammar school teacher in each district ( of which there were then eight ) , but they were then left to their own devices chief superintendent of education egerton ryerson attempted to reform the schools in the 1850s and 1860s , moving control of the schools from counties ( the former districts ) to city authorities , securing their funding and introducing inspectors in recognition of the broad curricula offered , grammar schools were redesignated as secondary school by the act to improve the common and grammar schools of the province of ontario of 1871 during the late colonial period , these schools expanded and also schooled descendants of the very few mixed english and straits-chinese families , and descendants of some rich straits-born chinese merchant class families , who were educated in oxbridge or had london trade ties after independence it became the raffles girls ' school ( primary school ) , distinct from the branch school established by the local government after independence , the raffles girls ' school ( secondary school ) grammar schools on the english and later british models were founded during the colonial period , the first being the boston latin school , founded as the latin grammar school in 1635 an analogous concept to the contemporary english grammar school is the magnet school , a state-funded secondary institution that may select students from a given school district according to academic criteria in new zealand , a small number of schools are named '' grammar schools '' and follow the academic and cultural traditions established in the united kingdom the first grammar school in new zealand , auckland grammar school , was established in 1850 and formally recognised as an educational establishment in 1868 through the auckland grammar school appropriation act gymnasium ( school ) middle school anatolian high school debates on the grammar school history of education in england latin
