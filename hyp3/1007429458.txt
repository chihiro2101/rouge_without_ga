in view of the nazi persecution of the jews in germany , gandhi offered satyagraha as a method of combating oppression and genocide , stating : when gandhi was criticized for these statements , he responded in another article entitled '' some questions answered '' : in a similar vein , anticipating a possible attack on india by japan during world war ii , gandhi recommended satyagraha as a means of national defense ( what is now sometimes called '' civilian based defense '' ( cbd ) or '' social defence '' ) : 37 nonviolence ( ahimsa ) truth – this includes honesty , but goes beyond it to mean living fully in accord with and in devotion to that which is true not stealing non-possession ( not the same as poverty ) body-labour or bread-labour control of desires ( gluttony ) fearlessness equal respect for all religions economic strategy such as boycott of imported goods ( swadeshi ) on another occasion , he listed these rules as '' essential for every satyagrahi in india '' : must have a living faith in god must be leading a chaste life , and be willing to die or lose all his possessions must be a habitual khadi weaver and spinner must abstain from alcohol and other intoxicants gandhi used an example to explain this : if i want to deprive you of your watch , i shall certainly have to fight for it ; if i want to buy your watch , i shall have to pay for it ; and if i want a gift , i shall have to plead for it ; and , according to the means i employ , the watch is stolen property , my own property , or a donation satyagraha is sometimes used to refer to the whole principle of nonviolence , where it is essentially the same as ahimsa , and sometimes used in a '' marked '' meaning to refer specifically to direct action that is largely obstructive , for example in the form of civil disobedience in the context of satyagraha , truth therefore includes a ) truth in speech , as opposed to falsehood , b ) what is real , as opposed to nonexistent ( asat ) and c ) good as opposed to evil , or bad '' satyagraha '' is a tatpuruṣa compound of the sanskrit words satya ( meaning '' truth '' ) and āgraha ( '' polite insistence '' , or '' holding firmly to '' ) to those who preached violence and called nonviolent actionists cowards , he replied : i do believe that , where there is only a choice between cowardice and violence , i would advise violence.i would rather have india resort to arms in order to defend her honour than that she should , in a cowardly manner , become or remain a helpless witness to her own dishonour.but i believe that nonviolence is infinitely superior to violence , forgiveness is greater than punishment a euphemism sometimes used for satyagraha is that it is a '' silent force '' or a '' soul force '' ( a term also used by martin luther king jr '' he therefore made part of the discipline that satyagrahis : appreciate the other laws of the state and obey them voluntarily tolerate these laws , even when they are inconvenient be willing to undergo suffering , loss of property , and to endure the suffering that might be inflicted on family and friends gandhi , m 340 ) gandhi contrasted satyagraha ( holding on to truth ) with '' duragraha '' ( holding on by force ) , as in protest meant more to harass than enlighten opponents 57 the view taken by gandhi differs from the idea that the goal in any conflict is necessarily to defeat the opponent or frustrate the opponent 's objectives , or to meet one 's own objectives despite the efforts of the opponent to obstruct these thus , he says , '' sometimes poison is used to kill poison '' and for that reason as long as machinery is viewed as bad it can be used to undo itself therefore , the non-cooperation of satyagraha is in fact a means to secure the cooperation of the opponent that is consistent with truth and justice the essence of satyagraha is that it seeks to eliminate antagonisms without harming the antagonists themselves , as opposed to violent resistance , which is meant to cause harm to the antagonist satyagraha is also termed a '' universal force , '' as it essentially '' makes no distinction between kinsmen and strangers , young and old , man and woman , friend and foe this was critical to gandhi 's understanding of and faith in nonviolence : '' the world rests upon the bedrock of satya or truth rao , editors ; from section “ power of satyagraha , ” of the book the mind of mahatma gandhi , ahemadabad , india , revised edition , 1967 a satyagrahi therefore does not seek to end or destroy the relationship with the antagonist , but instead seeks to transform or '' purify '' it to a higher level
