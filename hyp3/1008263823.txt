the ventricular muscle twitches randomly rather than contracting in a co-ordinated fashion ( from the apex of the heart to the outflow of the ventricles ) , and so the ventricles fail to pump blood around the body – because of this , it is classified as a cardiac arrest rhythm , and patients in v-fib should be treated with cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( cpr ) and prompt defibrillation his description is as follows : '' the ventricular muscle is thrown into a state of irregular arrhythmic contraction , whilst there is a great fall in the arterial blood pressure , the ventricles become dilated with blood as the rapid quivering movement of their walls is insufficient to expel their contents ; the muscular action partakes of the nature of a rapid incoordinate twitching of the muscular tissue … the cardiac pump is thrown out of gear , and the last of its vital energy is dissipated in the violent and the prolonged turmoil of fruitless activity in the ventricular walls the use of this is often dictated around the world by advanced cardiac life support or advanced life support algorithms , which is taught to medical practitioners including doctors , nurses and paramedics and also advocates the use of drugs , predominantly epinephrine , after every second unsuccessful attempt at defibrillation , as well as cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( cpr ) between defibrillation attempts in the brugada syndrome , changes may be found in the resting ecg with evidence of right bundle branch block ( rbbb ) and st elevation in the chest leads v1-v3 , with an underlying propensity to sudden cardiac death idiopathic ventricular fibrillation occurs with a reputed incidence of approximately 1 % of all cases of out-of-hospital arrest , as well as 3–9 % of the cases of ventricular fibrillation unrelated to myocardial infarction , and 14 % of all ventricular fibrillation resuscitations in patients under the age of 40 it states : '' when the heart is diseased , its work is imperfectly performed : the vessels proceeding from the heart become inactive , so that you can not feel them … if the heart trembles , has little power and sinks , the disease is advanced and death is near defibrillation is the definitive treatment of ventricular fibrillation , whereby an electrical current is applied to the ventricular mass either directly or externally through pads or paddles , with the aim of depolarising enough of the myocardium for coordinated contractions to occur again some clinicians may attempt to defibrillate fine v-fib in the hope that it can be reverted to a cardiac rhythm compatible with life , whereas others will deliver cpr and sometimes drugs as described in the advanced cardiac life support protocols in an attempt to increase its amplitude and the odds of successful defibrillation left untreated , ventricular fibrillation is rapidly fatal as the vital organs of the body , including the heart , are starved of oxygen , and as a result patients in this rhythm will not be conscious or responsive to stimuli subsequent to this in 1850 , fibrillation was described by ludwig and hoffa when they demonstrated the provocation of ventricular fibrillation in an animal by applying a '' faradic '' ( electrical ) current to the heart weineng wang , zhiqiang wang , xiao peng , effects of the earth current frequency and distortion on residual current devices , scientific journal of control engineering , dec 2013 , vol 3 issue 6 pp 417-422 ac-1 : imperceptible ac-2 : perceptible but no muscle reaction ac-3 : muscle contraction with reversible effects ac-4 : possible irreversible effects ac-4.1 : up to 5 % probability of ventricular fibrillation ac-4.2 : 5-50 % probability of fibrillation ac-4.3 : over 50 % probability of fibrillation with ik1 suppressed , an hyperpolarizing effect is lost and therefore there can be activation of funny current even in myocardial cells ( which is normally suppressed by the hyperpolarizing effect of coexisting potassium currents ) people who survive a '' v-fib arrest '' and who make a good recovery are often considered for an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator , which can quickly deliver this same life-saving defibrillation should another episode of ventricular fibrillation occur outside a hospital environment in clinical practice , therefore , factors that would lead to the right conditions to favour such re-entry mechanisms include increased heart size through hypertrophy or dilatation , drugs which alter the length of the refractory period and areas of cardiac disease a more complete definition is that ventricular fibrillation is a '' turbulent , disorganized electrical activity of the heart in such a way that the recorded electrocardiogramic deflections continuously change in shape , magnitude and direction '' the significance and clinical importance of these observations and descriptions possibly of ventricular fibrillation were not recognised until john erichsen in 1842 described ventricular fibrillation following the ligation of a coronary artery ( erichsen je 1842 ) this is usually by application of an electric shock to the myocardium and is discussed in detail in the relevant article the next recorded description occurs 3000 years later and is recorded by vesalius , who described the appearance of '' worm-like '' movements of the heart in animals prior to death the waves eventually meet and cancel each other out , but , if an area of transient block occurred with a refractory period that blocked one wavefront and subsequently allowed the other to proceed retrogradely over the other path , then a self-sustaining circus movement phenomenon would result some advanced life support algorithms advocate its use once and only in the case of witnessed and monitored v-fib arrests as the likelihood of it successfully cardioversion a patient are small and this diminishes quickly in the first minute of onset ventricular fibrillation most commonly occurs within diseased hearts , and , in the vast majority of cases , is a manifestation of underlying ischemic heart disease the relevance of this is that theories of the underlying pathophysiology and electrophysiology must account for the occurrence of fibrillation in the apparent '' healthy '' heart coarse v-fib may be more responsive to defibrillation , while fine v-fib can mimic the appearance of asystole on a defibrillator or cardiac monitor set to a low gain
