prehistoric settlements at byblos were divided up by dunand into the following five periods , which were recently expanded and re-calibrated by yosef garfinkel to correlate with tell es-sultan ( jericho ) : early neolithic ( early phase ) corresponding to the pre-pottery neolithic b ( ppnb ) of jericho , represented by plastered floors and naviforme technology , dated between 8800 and 7000 bc ; early neolithic ( late phase ) corresponding to the pna of tell es-sultan ( jericho ) ix ( also yarmukian ) between 6400 and 5800 bc represented by pottery , sickle blades , figurines and small points , dated between 6400 and 5800 bc ; middle neolithic corresponding to the pnb of tell es-sultan ( jericho ) viii and represented by pottery , dated between 5800 and 5300 bc ; late neolithic corresponding to the middle chalcolithic of beth shean and represented by pottery , stone vessels , silos , chamber tombs and seals , dated between 5300 and 4500 bc ; early chalcolithic corresponding to the late chalcolithic of ghassulian , represented by jar burials , pierced flint , churn and a violin figurine , dated to between 4500 and 3600 bc and , late chalcolithic corresponding to the early bronze age , represented by architecture and cylinder seal impressions , dated to between 3600 and 3100 bc as gibelet or giblet , it came under the rule of the genoa embriaco family , who created for themselves the lord of gibelet , first as administrators of the city in the name of the republic of genoa , and then as a hereditary fief , undertaking to pay an annual fee to genoa and to the genoa cathedral ( genoa 's cathedral ) according to the writer philo of byblos ( quoting sanchuniathon , and quoted in eusebius ) , byblos founded by the phoenician shrine god el , ( whom the greeks identified with their god cronus ) during the greco-roman period , the temple of resheph was elaborately rebuilt , and the city , though smaller than its neighbours such as tyre and sidon , was a center for the cult of adonis one of the most important monuments of this period is the temple of the obelisks , dedicated to the canaanite war god resheph , but this had fallen into ruins by the time of alexander the great historic quarter and souks in the southeast section of the historic city , near the entrance of the archaeological site , is an old market where tourists can shop for souvenirs and antiques , or simply stroll along the old cobblestone streets and enjoy the architecture in the assyrian period , sibittibaal of byblos became tributary to tiglath-pileser iii in 738 bc , and in 701 bc , when sennacherib conquered all phoenicia , the king of byblos was urumilki the abundance of ancient fragments collected around the citadel , the situation of the necropolises to the north and south of the frankish enclosure provide the evidence that the city did not move and that gebeil is byblos trade with europe effectively dried up , and it was not until the coming of the first crusade in 1098 that prosperity returned to byblos , known then as gibelet or giblet in the achaemenid empire ( 538–332 bc ) , byblos was the fourth of four phoenician vassal kingdoms established by the persians ; the first three being sidon , tyre , and arwad archaeologists have recovered egyptian-made artifacts as old as a vessel fragment bearing the name of the second dynasty ruler khasekhemwy , although this '' may easily have reached byblos through trade and/or at a later period '' byblos was chosen by condé nast traveler as the second best city in the middle east for 2012 , beating tel aviv and dubai , and by the world tourism organization as the best arab tourist city for 2013 according to plutarch ’ s version of the egyptian osiris myth , the king ’ s servants met isis on the stairs of the spring and took her to the royal palace , where she found the body of her husband osiris embedded in one of the palace pillars it is said that the city of bint jbeil ( '' daughter of byblos '' ) in southern lebanon was founded by those shia muslims the growing city was evidently a wealthy one and seems to have been an ally ( among '' those who are on his waters '' ) of egypt for many centuries although the archaeological evidence seems to indicate a brief resurgence during the 22nd and 23rd dynasties , it is clear after the third intermediate period the egyptians started favoring tyre and sidon instead of byblos archaeological evidence at byblos , particularly the five byblian royal inscriptions dating back to around 1200–1000 bc , shows existence of a phoenician alphabet of twenty-two characters ; an important example is the ahiram sarcophagus byblos was crowned as the '' arab tour capital '' for the year 2016 by the lebanese minister of tourism in the grand serail in beirut it was located on the seaward slope of the larger of the two hills that used to compose ancient byblos , with a watered valley in between objects have been found at byblos naming the 13th dynasty egyptian king neferhotep i , and the rulers of byblos maintained close relationships with the new kingdom pharaohs of ancient egypt in the 12th and 13th century byblos became part of the county of tripoli , a crusader state connected to , but largely independent from , the crusader kingdom of jerusalem it was first excavated by ernest renan in 1860 , as published in his mission de phénicie ( 1865–1874 ) , then by pierre montet from 1921 until 1924 , followed by maurice dunand from 1925 over a period of forty years ( cronus was considered the nearest equivalent to the canaanite baal or baal hammon in interpretatio graeca used by the ancient greeks and romans the embriaco family 's residence , the byblos castle , along with the fortified town , served as an important military base for the crusaders in addition , when the new kingdom collapsed in the 11th century bc , byblos ceased being a colony and became the foremost city of phoenicia although a sasanian colony is known to have been established in the region following the early muslim conquests of 636 , there is little archaeological evidence for it the temple of the obelisks , originally built in 1600–1200 bc on top of the “ l-shaped temple , ” was moved by archaeologists to its present location it was later given to the maronites as a gift by prince yusuf shihab of lebanon in the mid-1700s , after they aided him in capturing the city the town was taken by saladin in 1187 , re-taken by the crusaders , conquered by baibars in 1266 , but it remained in the possession of the embriacos until around 1300
