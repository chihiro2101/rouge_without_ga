nuclear terrorism , according to a 2011 report published by the belfer center for science and international affairs at harvard university , can be executed and distinguished via four pathways : the use of a nuclear weapon that has been stolen or purchased on the black market the use of a crude explosive device built by terrorists or by nuclear scientists who the terrorist organization has furtively recruited the use of an explosive device constructed by terrorists and their accomplices using their own fissile material the acquisition of fissile material from a nation-state security council , president obama said that '' just one nuclear weapon exploded in a city -- be it new york or moscow , tokyo or beijing , london or paris -- could kill hundreds of thousands of people '' as early as december 1945 , politicians worried about the possibility of smuggling nuclear weapons into the united states , though this was still in the context of a battle between the superpowers of the cold war there was a perception in washington that the value of what is called 'special nuclear material ' - plutonium or highly enriched uranium ( heu ) - was so enormous that the strict financial accountability of the private contractors who dealt with it would be enough to protect it from falling into the wrong hands sally bedell , '' a realistic film stirs nbc debate , '' new york times (

8 , 1983 ) c19 in 1986 a private panel of experts known as the international task force on the prevention of terrorism released a report urging all nuclear-armed states to beware the dangers of terrorism and work on equipping their nuclear arsenals with permissive action links wins was formed in 2008 , less than a year after a break-in at the pelindaba nuclear facility in south africa , which contained enough enriched uranium to make several nuclear bombs the global initiative to combat nuclear terrorism ( gicnt ) is an international partnership of 88 nations and 5 official observers working to improve capacity on a national and international level for prevention , detection , and response to a nuclear terrorist event and there is concern about the possible detonation of a small , crude nuclear weapon by a militant group in a major city , with significant loss of life and property it is feared that a terrorist group could detonate a dirty bomb , a type of radiological weapon a radiological weapon may be very appealing to terrorist groups as it is highly successful in instilling fear and panic among a population ( particularly because of the threat of radiation poisoning ) and would contaminate the immediate area for some period of time , disrupting attempts to repair the damage and subsequently inflicting significant economic losses however it is generally believed , including by the interviewer hamid mir , that they were bluffing and that it would have been extremely unlikely for al-qaeda to have procured weapons of mass destruction at that time according to bunn & wier , bin laden requested a ruling ( a fatwa ) , and was subsequently informed via a cleric of saudi arabia during 2003 , of it being in accordance with sharia for him to use a nuclear device against civilians if it were the only course of action available to him in a situation of defending muslims against the actions of the u.s ” while pressure from a wide range of counter-terrorist activity has hampered al-qaeda 's ability to manage such a complex project , there is no sign that it has jettisoned its goals of acquiring fissile material in march 2016 , it was reported that a senior belgian nuclear official was being monitored by isis suspects linked to the november 2015 paris attacks leading the belgian federal agency for nuclear control to suspect that isis was planning on abducting the official to obtain nuclear materials for a dirty bomb however , according to nuclear terrorism researchers at harvard university ’ s belfer center for science and international affairs , there is no evidence that they continue to do so information reported to the international atomic energy agency ( iaea ) shows '' a persistent problem with the illicit trafficking in nuclear and other radioactive materials , thefts , losses and other unauthorized activities '' washington post , december 20 , 2007 , op-ed by micah zenko in june 2007 , the federal bureau of investigation released to the press the name of adnan gulshair el shukrijumah , allegedly the operations leader for developing tactical plans for detonating nuclear bombs in several american cities simultaneously in november 2006 , the alexander litvinenko poisoning with radioactive polonium '' represents an ominous landmark : the beginning of an era of nuclear terrorism , '' according to andrew j there have been incidents where individuals such as david hahn ( a former boy scout known for trying to build a nuclear reactor ) and others have been initially charged under the relevant legislation due to the extent of contamination but the charges later withdrawn either due to lack of evidence or other reasons in january 2010 , it was revealed that the us army was training a specialised unit '' to seal off and snatch back '' pakistani nuclear weapons in the event that militants would obtain a nuclear device or materials that could make one a study by the belfer center for science and international affairs at harvard university titled '' securing the bomb 2010 , '' found that pakistan 's stockpile '' faces a greater threat from islamic terror groups seeking nuclear weapons than any other nuclear stockpile on earth '' could terrorists get hold of a nuclear bomb ? , bbc , 2010-04-12 in 2015 , white house press secretary josh earnest said that the us has confidence that pakistan is '' well aware of the range of potential threats to its nuclear arsenal '' a 2016 study by the congressional research service titled 'pakistan 's nuclear weapons ' , noted that pakistan 's '' initiatives , such as strengthened export control laws , improved personnel security , and international nuclear security cooperation programs , have improved pakistan 's nuclear security '' in 2004 , bruce blair , president of the center for defense information stated : '' i would n't be at all surprised if nuclear weapons are used over the next 15 or 20 years , first and foremost by a terrorist group that gets its hands on a russian nuclear weapon or a pakistani nuclear weapon '' in 2006 , robert galluccii , dean of the school of foreign service , estimated that , “ it is more likely than not that al-qaeda or one of its affiliates will detonate a nuclear weapon in a u.s there is no credible evidence that any terrorist group has yet succeeded in obtaining a nuclear bomb or the materials needed to make one molander p 9 , retrieved march 11 , 2013 - this report uses smuggled nuclear weapons in container ships at a us port as an example , so speculates an exodus from coastal cities the obama administration will focus on reducing the risk of high-consequence , non-traditional nuclear threats the exercises were carried out at a training center in indiana , and were set up to '' simulate the aftermath of a small nuclear bomb blast , set off in a u.s if terrorist groups could sufficiently damage safety systems to cause a core meltdown at a nuclear power plant , and/or sufficiently damage spent fuel pools , such an attack could lead to widespread radioactive contamination the federation of american scientists have said that if nuclear power use is to expand significantly , nuclear facilities will have to be made extremely safe from attacks that could release massive quantities of radioactivity into the community later that year , president ford created the nuclear emergency search team ( nest ) , which under the atomic energy act is tasked with investigating the '' illegal use of nuclear materials within the united states , including terrorist threats involving the use of special nuclear materials '' according to graham allison , director of harvard university 's belfer center for science and international affairs , this law is a major reason why not a single nuclear weapon has been discovered outside the control of russia 's nuclear custodians in august 2002 , the united states launched a program to track and secure enriched uranium from 24 soviet-style reactors in 16 countries , in order to reduce the risk of the materials falling into the hands of terrorists or '' rogue states '' additionally , the gtri converted heu fuels to low-enriched uranium ( leu ) fuels , which has prevented their use in making a nuclear bomb within a short amount of time gallucci believes that “ the united states should instead consider a policy of expanded deterrence , which focuses not on the would-be nuclear terrorists but on those states that may deliberately transfer or inadvertently lead nuclear weapons and materials to them graham allison makes a similar case , arguing that the key to expanded deterrence is coming up with ways of tracing nuclear material to the country that forged the fissile material “ the goal would be twofold : first , to deter leaders of nuclear states from selling weapons to terrorists by holding them accountable for any use of their own weapons ; second , to give every leader the incentive to tightly secure their nuclear weapons and materials he makes three claims : ( 1 ) the nuclear intent and capability of terrorist groups such as al qaeda has been “ fundamentally exaggerated ; ” ( 2 ) “ the likelihood a terrorist group will come up with an atomic bomb seems to be vanishingly small ; ” and ( 3 ) policymakers are guilty of an “ atomic obsession ” that has led to “ substantively counterproductive ” policies premised on “ worst case fantasies ” in his book atomic obsession : nuclear alarmism from hiroshima to al-qaeda he argues that : '' anxieties about terrorists obtaining nuclear weapons are essentially baseless : a host of practical and organizational difficulties make their likelihood of success almost vanishingly small '' atomic obsession : nuclear alarmism from hiroshima to al-qaeda : oxford university press intelligence officials have pushed back , testifying before congress that the inability to recognize the shifting modus operandi of terrorist groups was part of the reason why members of aum shinrikyo , for example , were “ not on anybody ’ s radar screen '' a decade of terrorism statistics show a strong correlation between attack fatalities and the attribution of the attack , and lieber and press assert that '' neither a terror group nor a state sponsor would remain anonymous after a nuclear terror attack the use of heu and plutonium in satellites has raised the concern that a sufficiently motivated rogue state could retrieve materials from a satellite crash ( notably on land as occurred with kosmos 954 , mars 96 and fobos-grunt ) and then use these to supplement the yield of an already working nuclear device president obama , along with nearly fifty world leaders , discussed the threat of nuclear terrorism , what steps needed to be taken to mitigate illicit nuclear trafficking , and how to secure nuclear material however , world leaders at the summit failed to agree on baseline protections for weapons-usable material , and no agreement was reached on ending the use of highly enriched uranium ( heu ) in civil nuclear functions according to graham allison , director of harvard university ’ s belfer center for science and international affairs , the objectives of the nuclear security summit in seoul are to continue to , “ assess the progress made since the washington summit and propose additional cooperation measures to ( 1 ) combat the threat of nuclear terrorism , ( 2 ) protect nuclear materials and related facilities , and ( 3 ) prevent illicit trafficking in nuclear materials the documents cited khalid saying that , if osama bin laden is captured or killed by the coalition of the willing , an al-qaeda sleeper cell will detonate a '' weapon of mass destruction '' in a '' secret location '' in europe , and promised it would be '' a nuclear
