a-1 : obligor 's capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is strong a-2 : is susceptible to adverse economic conditions however the obligor 's capacity to meet its financial

speculative characteristics the obligor currently has the capacity to meet its financial obligation but faces major ongoing uncertainties that could impact its financial commitment on the obligation c : currently vulnerable to nonpayment and is dependent upon favorable business , financial and economic conditions for the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation d : is in payment default '' scoring of management and governance is made on a scale of weak , fair , satisfactory or strong , depending on the mix of positive and negative management scores and the existence and severity of governance deficiencies the press release sent with the decision said , in part : '' the downgrade reflects our opinion that the fiscal consolidation plan that congress and the administration recently agreed to falls short of what , in our view , would be necessary to stabilize the government 's medium-term debt dynamics '' more broadly , the downgrade reflects our view that the effectiveness , stability , and predictability of american policymaking and political institutions have weakened at a time of ongoing fiscal and economic challenges to a degree more than we envisioned when we assigned a negative outlook to the rating on april 18 , 2011 '' since then , we have changed our view of the difficulties in bridging the gulf between the political parties over fiscal policy , which makes us pessimistic about the capacity of congress and the administration to be able to leverage their agreement this week into a broader fiscal consolidation plan that stabilizes the government 's debt dynamics any time soon '' the united states department of the treasury , which had first called s & p 's attention to its 2 trillion error in calculating the ten-year deficit reduction under the budget control act , commented , '' the magnitude of this mistake – and the haste with which s & p changed its principal rationale for action when presented with this error – raise fundamental questions about the credibility and integrity of s & p ’ s ratings action '' the following day , s & p acknowledged in writing the us 2 trillion error in its calculations , saying the error '' had no impact on the rating decision '' and adding : in taking a longer term horizon of 10 years , the u.s since it did not charge fitch and moody 's and because the department did not give access to evidence , there has been speculation whether the lawsuit may have been in retaliation to s & p 's decision to downgrade on march 11 , 2014 , s & p downgraded the long-term sovereign debt rating of latin america 's largest economy , brazil , by one notch to bbb− , the agency 's lowest investment-grade rating , from bbb according to s & p , '' the downgrade reflects the combination of fiscal slippage , the prospect that fiscal execution will remain weak amid subdued growth in the coming years , a constrained ability to adjust policy ahead of the october presidential elections , and some weakening in brazil 's external accounts on september 9 , 2015 , standard & poor 's ratings services lowered its long-term foreign currency sovereign credit rating on the federative republic of brazil to 'bb+ ' from 'bbb− ' , and the long-term local currency sovereign credit rating to 'bbb− ' from 'bbb+ ' as a result , some critics have contended that the credit ratings agencies are beholden to these issuers in a conflict of interests and that their ratings are not as objective as they ought to be , due to this '' pay to play '' model s & p acknowledged making a us 2 trillion error in its justification for downgrading the credit rating of the united states in 2011 , but stated that it '' had no impact on the rating decision '' '' paul krugman wrote , '' it ’ s hard to think of anyone less qualified to pass judgment on america than the rating agencies , '' and , '' s & p ’ s demands suggest that it ’ s talking nonsense about the us fiscal situation '' and '' s & p ’ s rating of aaa of the rembrandt 2006-2 and 2006-3 cpdo notes was misleading and deceptive and involved the publication of information or statements false in material particulars and otherwise involved negligent misrepresentations to the class of potential investors in australia , which included local government financial services pty ltd and the councils , because by the aaa rating there was conveyed a representation that in s & p ’ s opinion the capacity of the notes to meet all financial obligations was “ extremely strong ” and a representation that s & p had reached this opinion based on reasonable grounds and as the result of an exercise of reasonable care when neither was true and s & p also knew not to be true at the time made in november 2009 , ten months after launching an investigation , the european commission ( ec ) formally charged s & p with abusing its position as the sole provider of international securities identification codes for united states securities by requiring european financial firms and data vendors to pay licensing fees for their use in its formal statement of objections , the ec alleged '' that s & p is abusing this monopoly position by enforcing the payment of licence fees for the use of us isins by ( a ) banks and other financial services providers in the eea and ( b ) information service providers in the eea
