as of 2020 , there are seven k1 boxes in existence , all of which have been listed at grade ii by historic england , with two still located on british streets the red telephone box was the result of a competition in 1924 to design a kiosk that would be acceptable to the london metropolitan boroughs which had hitherto resisted the post office 's effort to erect k1 kiosks on their streets because of widespread dissatisfaction with the gpo 's design , the metropolitan boroughs joint standing committee organised a competition for a superior one in 1923 , but the results were disappointing the birmingham civic society then produced a design of its own—in reinforced concrete—but it was informed by the director of telephones that the design produced by the office of the engineer-in-chief was preferred ; as the architects ' journal commented , '' no one with any knowledge of design could feel anything but indignation with the pattern that seems to satisfy the official mind '' the birmingham civic society did not give up and , with additional pressure from the royal institute of british architects , the town planning institute and the royal academy , the postmaster general was forced to think again ; and the result was that the rfac organised a limited competition the organisers invited entries from three respected architects and , along with the designs from the post office and from the birmingham civic society , the fine arts commission judged the competition and selected the design submitted by sir giles gilbert scott 9 the invitation had come at the time when scott had been made a trustee of sir john soane 's museum : his design for the competition was in the classical style , but topped with a dome reminiscent of soane 's self-designed mausoleums in st pancras old church and dulwich picture gallery , london that of scott 's design is the only one known to survive and is still where it was originally placed , in the left entrance arch to the royal academy the post office chose to make scott 's winning design in cast iron ( scott had suggested mild steel ) and to paint it red ( scott had suggested silver , with a '' greeny-blue '' interior ) and , with other minor changes of detail , it was brought into service as the kiosk no.2 or k2 k3 , introduced in 1929 , again by giles gilbert scott , was similar to k2 but was constructed from concrete and intended for nationwide use the k6 was the first red telephone kiosk to be extensively used outside london , and many thousands were deployed in virtually every town and city , replacing most of the existing kiosks and establishing thousands of new sites the design was again by scott , and was essentially a smaller and more streamlined version of the k2 , intended to be produced at a considerably cheaper cost , and to occupy less pavement space the k6 was the most prolific kiosk in the uk and its growth , from 1935 , can be seen from the bt archives : this made quality control and supervision of the manufacturing process difficult , when compared to the gpo 's experience with cast-iron post boxes , and was an important aspect of the gpo 's move towards cast-iron telephone kiosks lion foundry in kirkintilloch , macfarlane ( saracen foundry ) , and carron company near falkirk all produced batches of the k2 , the k6 and the k8 ; and , in addition , carron produced the single batch of k4 kiosks although many kiosks have been fitted with replacement backs over recent years , unmodified examples generally have the identity of their manufacturer marked on a plate on the outside at the bottom of their back panel from 1926 onwards , the fascias of post office kiosks were emblazoned with a prominent crown , representing the british government ( of which the post office was an agency ) in 1953 the new queen , elizabeth ii , decided to replace the tudor crown in all contexts with a representation of the actual crown generally used for british coronations , the st edward 's crown however , in scotland , following pillar box war , the post office ( like other government agencies there ) began to use , from 1955 , a representation of the actual crown of scotland to accommodate the two different designs of crown on k6 kiosks , the fascia sections were henceforth cast with a slot in them , into which a plate bearing the appropriate crown was inserted before the roof section was fitted however , since the early 1990s , when the heritage value of red kiosks began to be widely recognised , british telecom has picked out the crowns ( on both k2s and k6s ) in gold paint the k8 retained a red colour scheme , but it was a different shade of red : a slightly brighter '' poppy red '' , which went on to be the standard colour across all kiosks with regards to create a new box with easier access , lower maintenance and brighter lighting , the post office introduced a prototype run of '' croydon '' telephone boxes from 1972 , named as such because they were erected in croydon however , whilst the trials were successful , the quality of the materials and design made it too expensive for the post office to mass-produce and the design was not adopted many local authorities used legislation designed to protect buildings of architectural or historic importance to keep old telephone boxes in prominent locations and around 2,000 of them were given listed status the kiosk may be used for any legal purpose other than telephony and the contract of sale includes the following clause 5.5.4 : the buyer shall covenant not to sell , lease or license the goods to a competitor to the seller nor to permit a competitor to install electronic communications apparatus ( as defined in schedule 2 of the telecommunications act 1984 ) within the
