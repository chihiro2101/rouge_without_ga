and the spanish government , being as scrupulous as any other in maintaining the strict observance of the prohibitions imposed on , or the liberties allowed to , its subjects by itself , will severely chastise those of them who fail in their duties the ship was theirs , and being in immediate communication with the shore , was in the territory of the state of new york ; or , if not , at least half the number were actually on the soil of new york , and entitled to all the provisions of the law of nations , and the protection and comfort which the laws of that state secure to every human being within its limits on july 2 , 1839 , one of the africans , cinqué , freed himself and the other captives using a file that had been found and kept by a woman who , like them , had been on the tecora ( the portugal ship that had transported them illegally as slaves from west africa to cuba ) if such ship or vessel should be forced , by stress of weather , or other unavoidable cause , into the port and under the jurisdiction of a friendly power , she , and her cargo , and persons on board , with their property , and all the rights belonging to their personal relations as established by the laws of the state to which they belong , would be placed under the protection which the laws of nations extend to the unfortunate under such circumstances townsend while the prisoners awaited trial '' , beinecke rare book and manuscript library at yale university '' a chronology of the trials '' , amistad ctr john warner barber ( 1798–1885 ) , a history of the amistad captives , 1841 , e-text , university of north carolina amistad , gilder lehrman center , yale univ michael peil , '' legal background on the amistad case '' , cornell university ( includes case documents ) '' amistad court records online '' , footnote '' the amistad case '' , the university of missouri-kansas city law school the spanish minister stated '' i do not , in fact , understand how a foreign court of justice can be considered competent to take cognizance of an offence committed on board of a spanish vessel , by spanish subjects , and against spanish subjects , in the waters of a spanish territory ; for it was committed on the coasts of this island , and under the flag of this nation '' other american sailors had protested this and when the american ambassador raised the issue with the spaniards , on march 20 , 1839 '' her majesty , having taken into consideration all the circumstances , decided that the said seamen should be placed at the disposition of the american consul , seeing that the offence was committed in one of the vessels and under the flag of his nation , and not on shore various parties filed property claims with the district court to many of the african captives , to the ship , and to its cargo : ruiz and montez , lieutenant gedney , and captain henry green ( who had met the africans while on shore on long island and claimed to have helped in their capture ) '' the spaniards pointed out that by american law the jurisdiction over a vessel on the high seas , in time of peace , engaged in a lawful voyage , is , according to the laws of nations , under the exclusive jurisdiction of the state to which her flag belongs ; as much so as if constituting a part of its own domain constitution , which would put the clauses of the treaty above the state laws of connecticut or new york , where the ship had been taken into custody , '' no one who respects the laws of the country ought to oppose the execution of the treaty , which is the supreme law of the country they protested when judge william jay construed a statement by their minister as seeming to demand '' the surrender of the negroes apprehended on board the schooner amistad , as murderers , and not as property ; that is to say founding his demand on the law of nations , and not on the treaty of 1795 they established that the slaves had been captured in mendiland ( also spelled mendeland , current sierra leone ) in africa , sold to a portuguese trader in lomboko ( south of freetown ) in april 1839 , and taken to havana illegally on a portuguese ship '' the spanish held that the bailbonds that the men had to acquire ( so that they could leave jail and return to cuba ) caused them a grave financial burden , and '' by the treaty of 1795 , no obstacle or impediment to leave the u.s on june 27 , 1839 , la amistad ( '' friendship '' ) , a spanish vessel , departed from the port of havana , cuba ( then a spanish colony ) , for the camagüey province , also in cuba the united states district court for the district of connecticut , representing the spanish government , libelled that the '' slaves '' , cargo , and vessel be returned to spain as its property it ordered that the captives be delivered to the custody of the president of the united states for transportation to africa , since they were , in fact , legally free as the british had entered into a treaty with spain prohibiting the slave trade south of the equator , they considered it a matter of international law that the united states release the africans john quincy adams later argued this issue before the supreme court in 1841 , saying , the africans were in possession , and had the presumptive right of ownership ; they were in peace with the united states : taking them to the long island sound port of new london , connecticut , he presented officials with a written claim for his property rights under international admiralty law for salvage of the vessel , the cargo , and the africans judge jay took issue with the spanish minister 's request that the africans be turned over to spanish authorities ( which seemed to imply that they were fugitives instead of misbehaving property ) , because the 1795 treaty said that property should be restored directly to the control of its owners 597 when la amistad anchored near long island , however , the court believed it to be in the possession of the africans on board , who had never intended to become slaves gedney , commanding the usrcs cutter ( ship ) , saw some of the africans on shore and , assisted by his officers and crew , took custody of la amistad and the africans ( documenting the american south , university of north carolina ) the crew deceived the africans and steered la amistad north along the east coast of the united states , where the ship was sighted repeatedly 590 the abolitionists ' main argument before the district court was that a treaty between britain and spain of 1817 and a subsequent pronouncement by the spanish government had outlawed the slave trade across the atlantic the mende spared the lives of the two spaniards who could navigate the ship , josé ruiz and pedro montez , upon the condition that they would return the ship east back across the atlantic ocean to africa he said that the question of whether the '' negroes of the amistad '' had been enslaved in violation of the treaty was still an open one , '' and this government would with great reluctance erect itself into a tribunal to investigate such questions between two friendly sovereigns gilpin contended that if the africans were slaves ( as evidenced by the documents ) , then they must be returned to their rightful owner , in this case , the spanish government he argued that the spanish government sought the return of slaves who had been freed by the district court ; but the spanish government was not appealing the fact of their having been freed with leadership of black and white ministers from mostly presbyterian and congregational denominations , it was active in working for abolitionism in the united states and for the education of blacks , sponsoring the founding of howard university , among other institutions the spanish also sought to avoid talk about the law of nations , as some of their opponents argued that america had a duty under the law of nations to treat the africans with the same deference they would accord any other foreign sailors introducing copies of correspondence between the spanish government and the secretary of state , he criticized president martin van buren for his assumption of unconstitutional powers in the case : adams argued that neither pinckney 's treaty nor the adams–onís treaty were applicable to the case 15 gedney transferred the captured africans into the custody of the united states district court for the district of connecticut , at which time legal proceedings began '' the spaniards asked how , if america had demanded that these sailors in an american ship be turned over to them despite being in a spanish port , they could now try the spanish mutineers '' the minister noted that the spanish had recently turned over american sailors '' belonging to the crew of the american vessel 'william engs ' '' , whom it had tried by request of their captain and the american consul they went on to point out that the minister had stated that a payment to compensate the owners '' would be a slender compensation ; for though the property should remain , as it ought to remain , unimpaired , public vengeance would be frustrated '' a case before the circuit court in hartford , connecticut , was filed in september 1839 , charging the africans with mutiny and murder on la amistad 589 the africans denied that they were slaves or property , and argued that the court could not '' return '' them to the control of the government of spain '' the spanish pointed out that the statement jay was referring to was one where the spanish minister was '' speaking of the crime committed by the negroes slave revolt , and the punishment which they merit '' as the africans were victims of illegal kidnapping , the abolitionists argued they were not slaves and were free to return to africa the mende killed the ship 's cook , celestino , who had told them that they were to be killed and eaten by their captors 10 ( october 2009 ) in the creole case of 1841 , the united states dealt with another ship rebellion similar to that of the amistad the spanish government asked that the ship , cargo and slaves be restored to spain under the pinckney treaty of 1795 between spain and the united states a movie , amistad ( 1997 ) , was based on the events of the revolt and court cases , and howard jones ' 1987 book mutiny on the amistad
