the toaster was announced at the world of commodore expo in 1987 and released as a commercial product in december 1990 for the commodore amiga 2000 computer system , taking advantage of the video-friendly aspects of that system 's hardware to deliver the product at an unusually low cost of 2,399 a user still needs at least three video tape recorders ( vtr ) and a controller to perform b-roll linear video editing ( le ) , as the toaster serves merely as a switcher , which can be triggered through general-purpose input/output ( gpio ) to switch on cue in such a configuration , as the toaster has no edit-controlling capabilities because of the heavy use of dark blues and greens ( for which the ntsc television standard is weak ) , the external submarine shots in seaquest dsv could not have made it to air without the use of the asdg abekas driver , written specifically to solve this problem by aaron avery at asdg ( later elastic reality , inc as with all video switchers that use a frame buffer to create dves ( digital video effects ) , the video path through the toaster hardware introduced delays in the signals when the signal was in '' digital '' mode as such , during the early 1990s the toaster was widely used by consumer amiga owners , desktop video enthusiasts , and local television studios , and was even used during the tonight show regularly to produce special effects for comedy skits all of the external submarine shots in the tv series seaquest dsv were created using lightwave 3d , as were the outer-space scenes in the tv series babylon 5 ( although amiga hardware was only used for the first three seasons ) although initially offered as just an add-on to an amiga , the video toaster was soon available as a complete turn-key system that included the toaster , amiga , and sync generator thumb in 1993 , newtek announced the video toaster screamer , a parallel extension to the toaster built by deskstation technology , with four motherboards , each with a mips r4400 cpu running at and of ram these toaster systems became very popular , primarily because at a cost of around us 5,000 , they could do much of what a 100,000 fully professional video switcher ( such as an evans & sutherland ) could do at that time the tricaster packages the vt system as a turnkey solution in a custom-designed portable pc case with video , audio and remote computer inputs and outputs on the front and back of the case depending on the video setup of the user , this delay could be quite noticeable when viewed along with the corresponding audio , so some users installed audio delay circuits to match the toaster 's video-delay lag , as is common practice in video-switching studios dollars worth of conventional 3d virtual set equipment alone , and is also found in newtek 's venerable vt5 integrated production suite , the modern-day successor to the original video toaster with the additions of packages such as discreetfx 's millennium and thousands of wipes and backgrounds added over the years , one can still find the video toaster system in use today in fully professional systems the hardware component is a full-sized card that is installed into the amiga 2000 's unique single video expansion slot rather than the standard bus slots , and therefore can not be used with the a500 or a1000 models as of april 2008 , four versions are in production : the basic tricaster 2.0 , tricaster pro 2.0 , tricaster studio 2.0 and the new tricaster broadcast , the latter of which adds sdi and aes-ebu connectivity plus a preview output capability the amiga was well adapted to this application in that its system clock at was precisely double that of the ntsc color carrier frequency , , allowing for simple synchronization of the video signal
