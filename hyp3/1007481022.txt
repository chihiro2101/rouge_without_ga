because of confusion between xml schema as a specific w3c specification , and the use of the same term to describe schema languages in general , some parts of the user community referred to this language as wxs , an initialism for w3c xml schema , while others referred to it as xsd , an initialism for xml schema definition see schema - w3c see w3c xml schema definition language ( xsd ) 1.1 part 1 : structures in version 1.1 the w3c has chosen to adopt xsd as the preferred name , and that is the name used in this article the most obvious features offered in xsd that are not available in xml 's native document type definitions ( dtds ) are namespace awareness and datatypes , that is , the ability to define element and attribute content as containing values such as integers and dates rather than arbitrary text schema documents are organized by namespace : all the named schema components belong to a target namespace , and the target namespace is a property of the schema document as a whole when an instance document is validated against a schema ( a process known as assessment ) , the schema to be used for validation can either be supplied as a parameter to the validation engine , or it can be referenced directly from the instance document using two special attributes , xsi : schemalocation and xsi : nonamespaceschemalocation in addition , wildcard particles are allowed , which permit a set of different elements ( perhaps any element provided it is in a certain namespace ) it allows new data types to be constructed from these primitives by three mechanisms : restriction ( reducing the set of permitted values ) , list ( allowing a sequence of values ) , and union ( allowing a choice of values from several types ) varieties of content model include : element-only content , in which no text may appear ( other than whitespace , or text enclosed by a child element ) simple content , in which text is allowed but child elements are not empty content , in which neither text nor child elements are allowed mixed content , which permits both elements and text to appear a complex type can be derived from another complex type by restriction ( disallowing some elements , attributes , or values that the base type permits ) or by extension ( allowing additional attributes and elements to appear ) after xml schema-based validation , it is possible to express an xml document 's structure and content in terms of the data model that was implicit during validation the xml schema data model includes : the vocabulary ( element and attribute names ) the content model ( relationships and structure ) the data types this collection of information is called the post-schema-validation infoset ( psvi ) the primary reason for defining an xml schema is to formally describe an xml document ; however the resulting schema has a number of other uses that go beyond simple validation the schema can be used to generate human-readable documentation of an xml file structure ; this is especially useful where the authors have made use of the annotation elements although xml schema is successful in that it has been widely adopted and largely achieves what it set out to , it has been the subject of a great deal of severe criticism , perhaps more so than any other w3c recommendation david webber oasis comparison and insights white paper from august 2008 , general problems : it is too complicated ( the spec is several hundred pages in a very technical language ) , so it is hard to use by non-experts & ndash ; but many non-experts need schemas to describe data formats when describing mixed content , the character data can not be constrained in any way ( not even a set of valid characters can be specified ) defaults can not be specified separately from the declarations ( this makes it hard to make families of schemas that only differ in the default values ) ; element defaults can only be character data ( not containing markup ) the ability to select the type against which an element will be validated based on the values of the element 's attributes ( '' conditional type assignment '' ) the ability to specify wildcards ( for both elements and attributes ) that apply to all types in the schema , so that they all implement the same extensibility policy list of xml schemas - list of xml schemas in use on the internet sorted by purpose relax ng - another xml schema language ( an iso international standard ) that is often used with xsd datatypes xml schema editor - information about xsd tools xml schema languages - compares xsd to other xml schema languages
