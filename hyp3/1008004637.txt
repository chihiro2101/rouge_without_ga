the basilica of santa maria in aracoeli crowning the campidoglio , rome , is particularly associated with the sibyl , because a medieval tradition referred the origin of its name to an otherwise unattested altar , ara primogeniti dei , said to have been raised to the '' firstborn of god '' by the emperor augustus , who had been warned of his advent by the sibylline books : in the church the figures of augustus and of the tiburtine sibyl are painted on either side of the arch above the high altar in pausanias , description of greece , the first sibyl at delphi mentioned ( '' the former '' earlier ) was of great antiquity , and was thought , according to pausanias , to have been given the name '' sibyl '' by the libyans 6 ) , varro ( 1st century bc ) lists these ten : the persian , the libyan , the delphic , the cimmerian , the erythræan , the samian , the cumæan , the hellespontine ( in trojan territory ) , the phrygian ( at ancyra ) , and the tiburtine ( named albunea ) '' ( lanciani , 1896 ch 1 ) like prophets , renaissance sibyls forecasting the advent of christ appear in monuments : modelled by giacomo della porta in the santa casa at loreto , painted by raphael in santa maria della pace , by pinturicchio in the borgia apartments of the vatican , engraved by baccio baldini , a contemporary of botticelli , and graffites by matteo di giovanni in the pavement of the duomo of siena he gave a circumstantial account of the pagan sibyls that is useful mostly as a guide to their identifications , as seen by 4th-century christians : the tiburtine sibyl , by name albunea , is worshiped at tibur as a goddess , near the banks of the anio , in which stream her image is said to have been found , holding a book in her hand the second sibyl referred to by pausanias , and named '' herophile '' , seems to have been based ultimately in samos , but visited other shrines , at clarus , delos , and delphi and sang there , but that at the same time , delphi had its own sibyl , p.56 ) holds that two only of the greek sibyls were historical , namely herophile of erythrae and phyto of samos ; the former he thinks lived in the eighth century bc , the latter somewhat later frazer goes on : at first , the greeks seemed to have known only one sibyl the first known greek writer to mention a sibyl is heraclitus , in the 5th century bc : the sibyl , with frenzied mouth uttering things not to be laughed at , unadorned and unperfumed , yet reaches to a thousand years with her voice by aid of the god like heraclitus , plato speaks of only one sibyl , but in course of time the number increased to nine , with a tenth , the tiburtine sibyl , probably etruscan in origin , added by the romans brewer 's dictionary of phrase and fable , 1897 the best known depiction is that of michelangelo who shows five sibyls in the frescos of the sistine chapel ceiling ; the delphic sibyl , libyan sibyl , persian sibyl , cumaean sibyl and the erythraean sibyl eliot 's the waste land is prefaced by a quote from petronius ' satyricon ( 1st century ad ) the passage translates roughly as '' i saw with my own eyes the sibyl at cumae hanging in a jar , and when the boys said to her 'sibyl , what do you want ? ' that one replied ' i want to die ' in the 19th-century rodolfo lanciani recalled that at christmas time the presepio included a carved and painted figure of the sibyl pointing out to augustus the virgin and child , who appeared in the sky in a halo of light ippolito d'este rebuilt the villa d'este at tibur , the modern tivoli , from 1550 onward , and commissioned elaborate fresco murals in the villa that celebrate the tiburtine sibyl , as prophesying the birth of christ to the classical world to the classical sibyls of the greeks , the romans added a tenth , the tiburtine sibyl , whose seat was the ancient sabins–latin town of tibur ( modern tivoli ) 116 until the literary elaborations of roman writers , sibyls were not identified by a personal name , but by names that refer to the location of their temenos , or shrine the persian sibyl was said to be a prophetic priestess presiding over the apollonian oracle ; though her location remained vague enough so that she might be called the '' babylonian sibyl '' , the persian sibyl is said to have foretold the exploits of alexander the great while the text speaks of the coming of jesus christ , the composer reflects the mystical aura of the prophecies by utilizing chromaticism in an extreme manner , a compositional technique that became very fashionable at the time walter burkert observes that '' frenzied women from whose lips the god speaks '' are recorded very much earlier in the near east , as in mari in the second millennium and in assyria in the first millennium '' gergis , a city of dardania in the troad , a settlement of the ancient teucer , and , consequently , a town of very great antiquity the first writer who is known to have distinguished several sibyls is heraclides ponticus in his book on oracles , in which he appears to have enumerated at least three , namely the phrygian , the erythraean , and the hellespontine the word acrostic was first applied to the prophecies of the erythraean sibyl , which were written on leaves and arranged so that the initial letters of the leaves always formed a word that only two of the greek sibyls were historical : erythraean sibyl , who is thought to have lived in the 8th century bc , and samian sibyl who lived somewhat later the sibyl , who was born near there , at marpessus , and whose tomb was later marked by the temple of apollo built upon the archaic site , appears on the coins of gergis , 400 & ndash ; 350 bce it had a temple sacred to apollo gergithius , and was said to have given birth to the sibyl , who is sometimes called erythraea , ‘ from erythrae , ’ a small place on mount ida , dionysius of halicarnassus i 117 ) that the conquest of cumae by the oscans in the 5th century destroyed the tradition , but provides a terminus ante quem for a cumaean sibyl ( archived 2005 ) the number of sibyls so depicted could vary , sometimes they were twelve ( see , for example , the apennine sibyl ) , sometimes ten , e.g pitt-kethley , fiona , journeys to the underworld , 1988 potter , david stone , prophecy and history in the crisis of the roman empire : a historical commentary on the thirteenth sibylline oracle , 1990 '' the two figures , carved in wood , have now 1896 disappeared ; they were given away or sold thirty years ago , when a new set of images was offered to the presepio by prince alexander torlonia later , fallen , ill , in the darkness of the middle ages , on heaths and in forests , it was hidden by the witch & nbsp ; in medieval latin , sibylla became simply the term for '' prophetess '' , and it became common in late gothic and renaissance art to depict female sibyllae alongside male prophets
