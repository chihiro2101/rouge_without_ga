500 years of new words , bill sherk the first use of the word semaphore in reference to english use was in 1816 : '' the improved semaphore has been erected on the top of the admiralty '' , referring to the installation of a simpler telegraph invented by sir home popham modern design of semaphores was first foreseen by the british polymath robert hooke , who gave a vivid and comprehensive outline of visual telegraphy to the royal society in a 1684 submission in which he outlined many practical details using a network of signalling sections erected on high ground , the signal would be observed from one station to the next by means of a telescope credit for the first successful optical telegraph goes to the french engineer claude chappe and his brothers in 1792 , who succeeded in covering france with a network of 556 stations stretching a total distance of france was surrounded by the forces of britain , the netherlands , prussia , austria , and spain , the cities of marseille and lyon were in revolt , and the british fleet held toulon in mid-1790 , the chappe brothers set about devising a system of communication that would allow the central government to receive intelligence and to transmit orders in the shortest possible time the message to be sent was chosen by town officials at brûlon and sent by rené chappe to claude chappe at parcé who had no pre-knowledge of the message in the summer of 1792 claude was appointed ingénieur-télégraphiste and charged with establishing a line of stations between paris and lille , a distance of 230 kilometres ( about 143 miles ) how napoleon 's semaphore telegraph changed the world , bbc news , hugh schofield , 16 june 2013 the first symbol of a message to lille would pass through 15 stations in only nine minutes the speed of the line varied with the weather , but the line to lille typically transferred 36 symbols , a complete message , in about 32 minutes the chappe brothers determined by experiment that it was easier to see the angle of a rod than to see the presence or absence of a panel '' step 1 , movement 1 ( setup ) : the operator turned the indicator arms to align with the cross bar , forming a non-symbol , and then turned the cross bar into position for the next symbol the shutter stations were temporary wooden huts , and at the conclusion of the napoleonic wars they were no longer necessary , and were closed down by the admiralty in march 1816 military signals from the south coast , john goodwin , 2000 following the battle of trafalgar , the news was transmitted to london by frigate to falmouth , from where the captain took the dispatches to london by coach along what became known as the trafalgar way ; the journey took 38 hours a replacement semaphore system was sought , and of the many ideas and devices put forward the admiralty chose the simpler semaphore system invented by sir home popham a popham semaphore was a single fixed vertical 30 foot pole , with two movable 8 foot arms attached to the pole by horizontal pivots at their ends , one arm at the top of the pole , and the other arm at the middle of the pole the signals of the popham semaphore were found to be much more visible than those of the murray shutter telegraph the semaphore line did not use the same locations as the shutter chain , but followed almost the same route with 15 stations : admiralty ( london ) , chelsea royal hospital , putney heath , coombe warren , claygate , chatley heath , pewley hill , witley , haste hill ( haslemere ) , woolbeding , harting , compton down , camp down , lumps fort ( southsea ) , and hmnb portsmouth the semaphore tower at chatley heath , which replaced the netley heath station of the shutter telegraph , is currently being restored by the landmark trust as self-catering holiday accommodation the board of the port of liverpool obtained a private act of parliament to construct a chain of popham optical semaphore stations from liverpool to holyhead in 1825 faster than the wind , the liverpool to holyhead telegraph , frank large , an avid publication the system was designed and part-owned by barnard l 197 seija-riitta laakso , across the oceans : development of overseas business information transmission 1815-1875 , bod - books on demand , 2018 many of the prominences on which the towers were built ( 'telegraph hills ' ) are known as telegraph hill to this day the completed system ran from dublin to galway and was to act as a rapid warning system in case of french invasion of the west coast of ireland in operation by 1800 , it ran between the city of halifax and the town of annapolis in nova scotia , and across the bay of fundy to saint john and fredericton in new brunswick in addition to providing information on approaching ships , the duke used the system to relay military commands , especially as they related to troop discipline initially , it was planned that semaphore stations be established on the bell towers and domes of the island 's churches , but the religious authorities rejected the proposal due to this , in 1848 new semaphore towers were constructed at għargħur and għaxaq on the main island , and another was built at ta ' kenuna on gozo a series of towers were built between fort william , kolkata to chunar fort near varanasi.the towers in the plains were tall and those in the hills were tall , and were built at an interval of about the innovative portuguese telegraphs , designed by francisco ciera , a mathematician , were of 3 types : 3 shutters , 3 balls and 1 pointer/moveable arm ( the first for longer distances , the other two for short ) and with the advantage of all having only 6 significant positions in spain , the engineer agustín de betancourt developed his own system which was adopted by that state ; in 1798 he received a royal appointment , and the first stretch of line connecting madrid and aranjuez was in operation as of august 1800 these lines served many other spanish cities , including : aranjuez , badajoz , burgos , castellon , ciudad real , córdoba , cuenca , gerona , pamplona , san sebastian , seville , tarancon , taragona , toledo , valladolid , valencia , vitoria and zaragoza the rugged topography of the iberian peninsula that facilitated the design of semaphore lines conveying information from hilltop to hilltop , made it difficult to implement wire telegraph lines when that technology was introduced in the mid 19th century the madrid-cadiz line was the first to be dismantled in 1855 , but other segments of the optical system continued to function until the end of the carlist wars in 1876 once it had proved its success in france , the optical telegraph was imitated in many other countries , especially after it was used by napoleon to coordinate his empire and army 179–180 in 1801 , the danish post office installed a semaphore line across the great belt strait , storebæltstelegrafen , between islands funen and zealand with stations at nyborg on funen , on the small island sprogø in the middle of the strait , and at korsør on zealand in the kingdom of prussia , frederick william iii ordered the construction of an experimental line in 1819 , but due to the procrastination of defence minister karl von hake , nothing happened until 1830 when a short three-station line between berlin and potsdam was built the two lines were later linked with three additional stations to create possibly the only private telegraph network in the optical telegraph era 186 the telegraph inspector for this network was friedrich clemens gerke , who would later move to the hamburg-cuxhaven electrical telegraph line and develop what became the international morse code an optical telegraph system linking philadelphia and the mouth of the delaware bay was in place by 1809 and had a similar purpose ; a second line to new york city was operational by 1834 , when its philadelphia terminus was moved to the tower of the merchants exchange one of the principal hills in san francisco , california is also named '' telegraph hill '' , after the semaphore telegraph which was established there in 1849 to signal the arrival of ships into san francisco bay 214 chappe and edelcrantz independently invented many features that are now commonplace in modern networks , but were then revolutionary and essential to the smooth running of the systems the details of the early chappe system are not known precisely ; the first operating instructions to survive date to 1809 and the french system is not as fully explained as the swedish 214–215 routing in the french system was almost permanently fixed ; only paris and the station at the remote end of a line were allowed to initiate a message the prussian system required the coblenz station ( at the end of the line ) to send a '' no news '' message ( or a real message if there was one pending ) back to berlin on the hour , every hour in chapter 60 ( '' the telegraph '' ) of alexandre dumas ' the count of monte cristo ( 1844 ) , the title character describes with fascination the semaphore line 's moving arms : '' i had at times seen rise at the end of a road , on a hillock and in the bright light of the sun , these black folding arms looking like the legs of an immense beetle '' see second paragraph in a fictional optical telegraph network forms a key part of the plot of the terry pratchett novels the fifth elephant , and especially going postal , where a telegraph system , known as '' the clacks '' and operated by the '' grand trunk company '' , stretches across the discworld the '' clacks '' are described as being similar to real-life murray six-shutter telegraphs , although they are referred to as semaphore towers , and pratchett 's novels , in particular night watch , also describe manual semaphore being in use within the city watch , with the watch interacting with the semaphore towers
