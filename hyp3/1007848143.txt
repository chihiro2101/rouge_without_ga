glycogen is in muscle , liver , and fat cells is stored in a hydrated form , composed of three or four parts of water per part of glycogen associated with 0.45 & nbsp ; millimoles ( 18 & nbsp ; mg ) of potassium per gram of glycogen in response to insulin levels being below normal ( when blood levels of glucose begin to fall below the normal range ) , glucagon is secreted in increasing amounts and stimulates both glycogenolysis ( the breakdown of glycogen ) and gluconeogenesis ( the production of glucose from other sources ) glycogen is a branched biopolymer consisting of linear chains of glucose residues with an average chain length of approximately 8–12 glucose units and 2,000-60,000 & nbsp ; residues per one molecule of glycogen glucose units are linked together linearly by α ( 1→4 ) glycosidic bonds from one glucose to the next fasting , low-intensity endurance training ) , the body can condition type & nbsp ; i muscle fibers to improve both fuel use efficiency and workload capacity to increase the percentage of fatty acids used as fuel , sparing carbohydrate use from all sources glycogen is cleaved from the nonreducing ends of the chain by the enzyme glycogen phosphorylase to produce monomers of glucose-1 & nbsp ; phosphate : in vivo , phosphorolysis proceeds in the direction of glycogen breakdown because the ratio of phosphate and glucose-1-phosphate is usually greater than 100 as muscle cells lack glucose-6-phosphatase , which is required to pass glucose into the blood , the glycogen they store is available solely for internal use and is not shared with other cells this is in contrast to liver cells , which , on demand , readily do break down their stored glycogen into glucose and send it through the blood stream as fuel for other organs the glycogen branching enzyme catalyzes the transfer of a terminal fragment of six or seven glucose residues from a nonreducing end to the c-6 & nbsp ; hydroxyl group of a glucose residue deeper into the interior of the glycogen molecule when athletes ingest both carbohydrate and caffeine following exhaustive exercise , their glycogen stores tend to be replenished more rapidly ; however , the minimum dose of caffeine at which there is a clinically significant effect on glycogen repletion has not been established . for the next 8–12 hours , glucose derived from liver glycogen is the primary source of blood glucose used by the rest of the body for fuel long-distance athletes , such as marathon runners , cross-country skiing , and cyclists , often experience glycogen depletion , where almost all of the athlete 's glycogen stores are depleted after long periods of exertion without sufficient carbohydrate consumption after about eight glucose molecules have been added to a tyrosine residue , the enzyme glycogen synthase progressively lengthens the glycogen chain using udp-glucose , adding α ( 1→4 ) -bonded glucose to the reducing end of the glycogen chain
