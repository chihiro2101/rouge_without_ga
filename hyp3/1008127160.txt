enthalpy is a thermodynamic potential , designated by the letter '' h '' , that is the sum of the internal energy of the system ( u ) plus the product of pressure ( p ) and volume ( v ) heat transfer is a process function ( or path function ) , as opposed to functions of state ; therefore , the amount of heat transferred in a thermodynamic process that changes the state of a system depends on how that process occurs , not only the net difference between the initial and final states of the process thermodynamic and mechanical heat transfer is calculated with the heat transfer coefficient , the proportionality between the heat flux and the thermodynamic driving force for the flow of heat this usage has its origin in the historical interpretation of heat as a fluid ( caloric ) that can be transferred by various causes , and that is also common in the language of laymen and everyday life the transport equations for thermal energy ( fourier 's law ) , mechanical momentum ( newtonian fluid ) , and mass transfer ( fick 's laws of diffusion ) are similar , and analogies among these three transport processes have been developed to facilitate prediction of conversion from any one to the others heat transfer is classified into various mechanisms , such as thermal conduction , thermal convection , thermal radiation , and transfer of energy by phase changes the fundamental modes of heat transfer are : ; advection : advection is the transport mechanism of a fluid from one location to another , and is dependent on motion and momentum of that fluid this can be described by the formula : : \phi_q v \rho c_p \delta t where \phi_q is heat flux ( w/m 2 ) , \rho is density ( kg/m 3 ) , c_p is heat capacity at constant pressure ( j/kg·k ) , \delta t is the difference in temperature ( k ) , v is velocity ( m/s ) on a microscopic scale , heat conduction occurs as hot , rapidly moving or vibrating atoms and molecules interact with neighboring atoms and molecules , transferring some of their energy ( heat ) to these neighboring particles the process of heat transfer from one place to another place without the movement of particles is called conduction , such as when placing a hand on a cold glass of water—heat is conducted from the warm skin to the cold glass , but if the hand is held a few inches from the glass , little conduction would occur since air is a poor conductor of heat steady state conduction is an idealized model of conduction that happens when the temperature difference driving the conduction is constant , so that after a time , the spatial distribution of temperatures in the conducting object does not change any further ( see fourier 's law ) in steady state conduction , the amount of heat entering a section is equal to amount of heat coming out , since the change in temperature ( a measure of heat energy ) is zero an example of steady state conduction is the heat flow through walls of a warm house on a cold day—inside the house is maintained at a high temperature and , outside , the temperature stays low , so the transfer of heat per unit time stays near a constant rate determined by the insulation in the wall and the spatial distribution of temperature in the walls will be approximately constant over time the flow of fluid may be forced by external processes , or sometimes ( in gravitational fields ) by buoyancy forces caused when thermal energy expands the fluid ( for example in a fire plume ) , thus influencing its own transfer convective heat transfer , or convection , is the transfer of heat from one place to another by the movement of fluids , a process that is essentially the transfer of heat via mass transfer bulk motion of fluid enhances heat transfer in many physical situations , such as ( for example ) between a solid surface and the fluid although sometimes discussed as a third method of heat transfer , convection is usually used to describe the combined effects of heat conduction within the fluid ( diffusion ) and heat transference by bulk fluid flow streaming the process of transport by fluid streaming is known as advection , but pure advection is a term that is generally associated only with mass transport in fluids , such as advection of pebbles in a river in the case of heat transfer in fluids , where transport by advection in a fluid is always also accompanied by transport via heat diffusion ( also known as heat conduction ) the process of heat convection is understood to refer to the sum of heat transport by advection and diffusion/conduction free , or natural , convection occurs when bulk fluid motions ( streams and currents ) are caused by buoyancy forces that result from density variations due to variations of temperature in the fluid forced convection is a term used when the streams and currents in the fluid are induced by external means—such as fans , stirrers , and pumps—creating an artificially induced convection current convective cooling is sometimes described as newton 's law of cooling : however , by definition , the validity of newton 's law of cooling requires that the rate of heat loss from convection be a linear function of ( '' proportional to '' ) the temperature difference that drives heat transfer , and in convective cooling this is sometimes not the case if heat conduction is too great , fluid moving down by convection is heated by conduction so fast that its downward movement will be stopped due to its buoyancy , while fluid moving up by convection is cooled by conduction so fast that its driving buoyancy will diminish thermal radiation is energy emitted by matter as electromagnetic waves , due to the pool of thermal energy in all matter with a temperature above absolute zero since these atoms and molecules are composed of charged particles ( protons and electrons ) , their movement results in the emission of electromagnetic radiation , which carries energy away from the surface for radiative transfer between two objects , the equation is as follows : : \phi_q \epsilon \sigma f ( t_a^4 - t_b^4 ) , where \phi_q is the heat flux , \epsilon is the emissivity ( unity for a black body ) , \sigma is the stefan–boltzmann constant , f is the view factor between two surfaces a and b , and t_a and t_b are the absolute temperatures ( in kelvins or degrees rankine ) for the two objects ) the ( on its surface ) somewhat 4000 k hot sun allows to reach coarsly 3000 k ( or 3000 & nbsp ; °c , which is about 3273 k ) at a small probe in the focus spot of a big concave , concentrating mirror of the mont-louis solar furnace in france left the boiling point of a substance is the temperature at which the vapor pressure of the liquid equals the pressure surrounding the liquid and the liquid evaporates resulting in an abrupt change in vapor volume at high bubble generation rates , the bubbles begin to interfere and the heat flux no longer increases rapidly with surface temperature ( this is the departure from nucleate boiling , or dnb ) condensation on direct contact with a cooling wall of a heat exchanger : this is the most common mode used in industry : filmwise condensation is when a liquid film is formed on the subcooled surface , and usually occurs when the liquid wets the surface the internal energy of a substance is increased , typically with heat or pressure , resulting in a rise of its temperature to the melting point , at which the ordering of ionic or molecular entities in the solid breaks down to a less ordered state and the solid liquefies lumped system analysis often reduces the complexity of the equations to one first-order linear differential equation , in which case heating and cooling are described by a simple exponential solution , often referred to as newton 's law of cooling system analysis by the lumped capacitance model is a common approximation in transient conduction that may be used whenever heat conduction within an object is much faster than heat conduction across the boundary of the object in this method , the ratio of the conductive heat resistance within the object to the convective heat transfer resistance across the object 's boundary , known as the biot number , is calculated for small biot numbers , the approximation of spatially uniform temperature within the object can be used : it can be presumed that heat transferred into the object has time to uniformly distribute itself , due to the lower resistance to doing so , as compared with the resistance to heat entering the object thermal resistance is a heat property and the measurement by which an object or material resists to heat flow ( heat per time unit or thermal resistance ) to temperature difference 300px a heat engine is a system that performs the conversion of a flow of thermal energy ( heat ) to mechanical energy to perform mechanical work sonntag : '' a heat engine may be defined as a device that operates in a thermodynamic cycle and does a certain amount of net positive work as a result of heat transfer from a high-temperature body and to a low-temperature body in parallel flow , both fluids move in the same direction while transferring heat ; in counter flow , the fluids move in opposite directions ; and in cross flow , the fluids move at right angles to each other since part of this re-radiation is back towards the surface and the lower atmosphere , it results in an elevation of the average surface temperature above what it would be in the absence of the gases for heat transfer from the outer surface of the body , the convection mechanism is dependent on the surface area of the body , the velocity of the air , and the temperature gradient between the surface of the skin and the ambient air '' smart fibres , fabrics , and clothing '' , woodhead publishing , 2001 this thermal resistance causes the temperature on the surface of the clothing to be less than the temperature on the surface of the skin the heat carried by the blood is determined by the temperature of the surrounding tissue , the diameter of the blood vessel , the viscosity , velocity of the flow , and the heat transfer coefficient of the blood the energy needed to evaporate the water is taken from the air in the form of sensible heat and converted into latent heat , while the air remains at a constant enthalpy in the case of the earth-atmosphere system , it refers to the process by which long-wave ( infrared ) radiation is emitted to balance the absorption of short-wave ( visible ) energy from the sun the thermosphere ( top of atmosphere ) cools to space primarily by infrared energy radiated by carbon dioxide ( co2 ) at 15 μm and by nitric oxide ( no ) at 5.3 μm the global infrared energy budget of the thermosphere from
