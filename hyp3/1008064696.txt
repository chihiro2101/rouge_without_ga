in the armed forces of prussia , russian empire , and other eastern european nations , it was common for officers to wear extremely tight pressing into their stomachs and gutting them up , wide belts around the waist , on the outside of the uniform , both to support a saber and for aesthetic reasons often the belt served only to emphasize the waist made small by a corset worn under the uniform , a practice which was common especially during the crimean wars and was often noted by soldiers from the western front as belts are constructed out of materials like leather that are both strong and light , a belt can be easily wielded to produce intense pain by using it as a whip to strike the buttocks of a misbehaving child the belt can symbolize fatherly authority and paternal responsibility for one 's children 's behavior and moral development , but corporal punishment is not recommended for use in modern society as it was in the past since the 1980s and more commonly in the mid-1990s , the practice of sagging the pants , in which the waistbands ( usually secured by a cinched belt ) of trousers or ( typically long ) shorts are worn at or below the hips , thereby exposing the top part of any underwear not obscured by an upper-body garment , has been seen among young men and boys , especially among those who are black and consanguine with hip-hop culture and fashion this practice is sometimes ( incorrectly ) believed to have originated with prison gangs and the prohibition of belts in prison ( due to their use as weapons and as devices for suicide ) -- historically , including in the latter part of the 20th century , gang-affiliated young men and boys were expected to wear their belts fastened tightly belts are also available in a range of other materials , including braided leather , tooled leather , suede , leather-backed ribbon , canvas , webbing , rope , vinyl , and others these are typically made out of a one-piece leather construction with a textured appearance , with a belt buckle in an antiqued finish , wider , thicker stitching , or bar-tacking , to ensure a strong construction studded belt : a studded belt is typically made of leather or similar materials , and is decorated with metal studs ( see gallery above )
