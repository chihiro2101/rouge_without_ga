rather the testimony of the younger seneca in a fragment from his de vita patris , suggests that his father remained all his life a private gentleman , declining to seek fame from his writing of a history of rome 'from the beginning of the civil wars ' , on which he was still engaged at the time of his death under the regime of caligula 3-4 that he regarded as honourable political careers such as his elder two sons had entered upon , and thought the study of rhetoric , as a preparation for them , correspondingly honourable ;
