specifically , research has demonstrated continuity in the disorders such that conduct disorder is often diagnosed in children who have been previously diagnosed with oppositional defiant disorder , and most adults with antisocial personality disorder were previously diagnosed with conduct disorder research has shown that there is a greater number of children with adolescent-onset conduct disorder than those with childhood-onset , suggesting that adolescent-onset conduct disorder is an exaggeration of developmental behaviors that are typically seen in adolescence , such as rebellion against authority figures and rejection of conventional values conduct disorder is estimated to affect 51.1 million people globally as of 2013 in addition to these two courses that are recognized by the dsm-iv-tr , there appears to be a relationship among oppositional defiant disorder , conduct disorder and antisocial personality disorder it is diagnosed based on a prolonged pattern of antisocial behaviour such as serious violation of laws and social norms and rules in people younger than the age of 18 moreover , conduct disorder in females is linked to several negative outcomes , such as antisocial personality disorder and early pregnancy , suggesting that sex differences in disruptive behaviors need to be more fully understood nonetheless , many of the individuals who do not meet full criteria for antisocial personality disorder still exhibit a pattern of social and personal impairments or antisocial behaviors however , according to studies on american youth , it appears that african-american youth are more often diagnosed with conduct disorder , while asian-american youth are about one-third as likely to develop conduct disorder when compared to white american youth according to dsm-5 criteria for conduct disorder , there are four categories that could be present in the child 's behavior : aggression to people and animals , destruction of property , deceitfulness or theft , and serious violation of rules the first is known as the '' childhood-onset type '' and occurs when conduct disorder symptoms are present before the age of 10 years hinshaw and lee ( 2003 ) also explain that association with deviant peers has been thought to influence the development of conduct disorder in two ways : 1 ) a “ selection ” process whereby youth with aggressive characteristics choose deviant friends , and 2 ) a “ facilitation ” process whereby deviant peer networks bolster patterns of antisocial behavior the second developmental course is known as the '' adolescent-onset type '' and occurs when conduct disorder symptoms are present after the age of 10 years therefore , it is important to exclude a substance-induced cause and instead address the substance use disorder prior to making a psychiatric diagnosis of conduct disorder in addition to the individual and social factors associated with conduct disorder , research has highlighted the importance of environment and context in youth with antisocial behavior while it is unlikely that adhd alone is a risk factor for developing conduct disorder , children who exhibit hyperactivity and impulsivity along with aggression is associated with the early onset of conduct problems the majority of research on conduct disorder suggests that there are a significantly greater number of males than females with the diagnosis , with some reports demonstrating a threefold to fourfold difference in prevalence conduct disorder is classified in the fourth edition of diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders ( dsm ) correspondingly , there is an established link between conduct disorder and the diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder as an adult in fact , the current diagnostic criteria for antisocial personality disorder require a conduct disorder diagnosis before the age of 15 having a sibling or parent with conduct disorder increases the likelihood of having the disorder , with a heritability rate of beyond difficulties in executive function , neurological research on youth with conduct disorder also demonstrate differences in brain anatomy and function that reflect the behaviors and mental anomalies associated in conduct disorder as mentioned above , it seems that there is a transactional relationship between substance use and conduct problems , such that aggressive behaviors increase substance use , which leads to increased aggressive behavior it is also argued that some children may not in fact have conduct disorder , but are engaging in developmentally appropriate disruptive behavior for instance , neighborhood safety and exposure to violence has been studied in conjunction with conduct disorder , but it is not simply the case that youth with aggressive tendencies reside in violent neighborhoods the findings support that if a caregiver is able to respond to infant cues , the toddler has a better ability to respond to fear and distress moreover , both disorders share relevant risk factors and disruptive behaviors , suggesting that oppositional defiant disorder is a developmental precursor and milder variant of conduct disorder the characteristics of the diagnosis are commonly seen in young children who are referred to mental health professionals similar criteria are used in those over the age of 18 for the diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder however , a correlation between a particular risk factor and a later developmental outcome ( such as conduct disorder ) can not be taken as definitive evidence for a causal link however , it is important to note that these are not static factors , but rather transactional in nature ( e.g no proposed revisions for the main criteria of conduct disorder exist in the dsm-5 ; there is a recommendation by the work group to add an additional specifier for callous and unemotional traits taken together , these findings may account for some of the variance in the psychological and behavioral patterns of youth with conduct disorder
