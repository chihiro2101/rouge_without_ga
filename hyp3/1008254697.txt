if a typical mammalian cell ( diameter ~10 micrometers ) were magnified to the size of a watermelon ( ~1 & nbsp ; ft/30 & nbsp ; cm ) , the lipid bilayer making up the plasma membrane would be about as thick as a piece of office paper for example , when a cell undergoes apoptosis , the phosphatidylserine & nbsp ; — normally localised to the cytoplasmic leaflet & nbsp ; — is transferred to the outer surface : there , it is recognised by a macrophage that then actively scavenges the dying cell lipid asymmetry arises , at least in part , from the fact that most phospholipids are synthesised and initially inserted into the inner monolayer : those that constitute the outer monolayer are then transported from the inner monolayer by a class of enzymes called flippases flippases are members of a larger family of lipid transport molecules that also includes floppases , which transfer lipids in the opposite direction , and scramblases , which randomize lipid distribution across lipid bilayers ( as in apoptotic cells ) at a given temperature a lipid bilayer can exist in either a liquid or a gel ( solid ) phase all lipids have a characteristic temperature at which they transition ( melt ) from the gel to liquid phase in both phases the lipid molecules are prevented from flip-flopping across the bilayer , but in liquid phase bilayers a given lipid will exchange locations with its neighbor millions of times a second an example of this effect can be noted in everyday life as butter , which has a large percentage saturated fats , is solid at room temperature while vegetable oil , which is mostly unsaturated , is liquid if some of the components are liquid at a given temperature while others are in the gel phase , the two phases can coexist in spatially separated regions , rather like an iceberg floating in the ocean this phase separation plays a critical role in biochemical phenomena because membrane components such as proteins can partition into one or the other phase and thus be locally concentrated or activated for instance , ps presence on the extracellular membrane face of erythrocytes is a marker of cell apoptosis , whereas ps in growth plate vesicles is necessary for the nucleation of hydroxyapatite crystals and subsequent bone mineralization this barrier takes the form of a lipid bilayer in all known life forms except for a few species of archaea that utilize a specially adapted lipid monolayer the partitioning ability of the lipid bilayer is based on the fact that hydrophilic molecules can not easily cross the hydrophobic bilayer core , as discussed in transport across the bilayer below the nucleus , mitochondria and chloroplasts have two lipid bilayers , while other sub-cellular structures are surrounded by a single lipid bilayer ( such as the plasma membrane , endoplasmic reticula , golgi apparatus and lysosomes ) many prokaryotes also have a cell wall , but the cell wall is composed of proteins or long chain carbohydrates , not lipids all of these sub-cellular compartments are surrounded by one or more lipid bilayers and , together , typically comprise the majority of the bilayer area present in the cell in liver hepatocytes for example , the plasma membrane accounts for only two percent of the total bilayer area of the cell , whereas the endoplasmic reticulum contains more than fifty percent and the mitochondria a further thirty percent alternatively , some membrane proteins penetrate all the way through the bilayer and serve to relay individual signal events from the outside to the inside of the cell gpcrs are responsible for much of the cell 's ability to sense its surroundings and , because of this important role , approximately 40 % of all modern drugs are targeted at gpcrs resolution is usually limited to a few hundred nanometers , much smaller than a typical cell but much larger than the thickness of a lipid bilayer in an electron microscope , a beam of focused electrons interacts with the sample rather than a beam of light as in traditional microscopy in conjunction with rapid freezing techniques , electron microscopy has also been used to study the mechanisms of inter- and intracellular transport , for instance in demonstrating that exocytosis vesicles are the means of chemical release at synapses the analysis of 31 p-nmr spectra of lipids could provide a wide range of information about lipid bilayer packing , phase transitions ( gel phase , physiological liquid crystal phase , ripple phases , non bilayer phases ) , lipid head group orientation/dynamics , and elastic properties of pure lipid bilayer and as a result of binding of proteins and other biomolecules rather than using a beam of light or particles , a very small sharpened tip scans the surface by making physical contact with the bilayer and moving across it , like a record player needle most polar molecules have low solubility in the hydrocarbon core of a lipid bilayer and , as a consequence , have low permeability coefficients across the bilayer ion pumps are the proteins that build and maintain the chemical gradients by utilizing an external energy source to move ions against the concentration gradient to an area of higher chemical potential when a vesicle is produced inside the cell and fuses with the plasma membrane to release its contents into the extracellular space , this process is known as exocytosis in the reverse process , a region of the cell membrane will dimple inwards and eventually pinch off , enclosing a portion of the extracellular fluid to transport it into the cell exocytosis in prokaryotes : membrane vesicular exocytosis , popularly known as membrane vesicle trafficking , a nobel prize-winning ( year , 2013 ) process , is traditionally regarded as a prerogative of eukaryotic cells this myth was however broken with the revelation that nanovesicles , popularly known as bacterial outer membrane vesicles , released by gram-negative microbes , translocate bacterial signal molecules to host or target cells yashroy r c ( 1993 ) electron microscope studies of surface pili and vesicles of salmonella 3,10 : r : - organisms this increase in permeability primarily affects transport of ions and other hydrated species , indicating that the mechanism is the creation of nm-scale water-filled holes in the membrane in contrast , during electroporation the lipid molecules are not chemically altered but simply shift position , opening up a pore that acts as the conductive pathway through the bilayer as it is filled with water k a and k b affect the ability of proteins and small molecules to insert into the bilayer , and bilayer mechanical properties have been shown to alter the function of mechanically activated ion channels as discussed in the structure and organization section , the hydrophobic attraction of lipid tails in water is the primary force holding lipid bilayers together in contrast to k a , which is a measure of how much energy is needed to stretch the bilayer , k b is a measure of how much energy is needed to bend or flex the bilayer the origin of this energy is the fact that creating such an interface exposes some of the lipid tails to water , but the exact orientation of these border lipids is unknown alternatively , if only one leaflet from each bilayer is involved in the fusion process , the bilayers are said to be hemifused fusion is involved in many cellular processes , in particular in eukaryotes , since the eukaryotic cell is extensively sub-divided by lipid bilayer membranes exocytosis , fertilization of an egg by sperm activation , and transport of waste products to the lysozome are a few of the many eukaryotic processes that rely on some form of fusion even the entry of pathogens can be governed by fusion , as many bilayer-coated viruses have dedicated fusion proteins to gain entry into the host cell finally , in the last step of fusion , this point defect grows and the components of the two bilayers mix and diffuse away from the site of contact the first of these proteins to be studied were the viral fusion proteins , which allow an enveloped virus to insert its genetic material into the host cell ( enveloped viruses are those surrounded by a lipid bilayer ; some others have only a protein coat ) they can also be used in the field of synthetic biology , to define the boundaries of artificial cells among the most common model systems are : black lipid membranes ( blm ) supported lipid bilayers ( slb ) tethered bilayer lipid membranes ( t-blm ) vesicles model lipid bilayer ( note- the term “ liposome ” is in essence synonymous with “ vesicle ” except that vesicle is a general term for the structure whereas liposome refers to only artificial not natural vesicles ) the basic idea of liposomal drug delivery is that the drug is encapsulated in solution inside the liposome then injected into the patient in theory , liposomes should make an ideal drug delivery system since they can isolate nearly any hydrophilic drug , can be grafted with molecules to target specific tissues and can be relatively non-toxic since the body possesses biochemical pathways for degrading lipids refinement of the lipid composition to tune fluidity , surface charge density , and surface hydration resulted in vesicles that adsorb fewer proteins from serum and thus are less readily recognized by the immune system since the lipid bilayer is the barrier between the interior and exterior of the cell , it is also the site of extensive signal transduction this parallel artificial membrane permeability assay pampa technique measures the permeability across specifically formulated lipid cocktail ( s ) found to be highly correlated with caco-2 cultures , the gastrointestinal tract , blood–brain barrier and skin by the early twentieth century scientists had come to believe that cells are surrounded by a thin oil-like barrier , but the structural nature of this membrane was not known when they compared the area of the monolayer to the surface area of the cells , they found a ratio of two to one later analyses showed several errors and incorrect assumptions with this experiment but , serendipitously , these errors canceled out and from this flawed data gorter and grendel drew the correct conclusion- that the cell membrane is a lipid bilayer around the same time , the development of model membranes confirmed that the lipid bilayer is a stable structure that can exist independent of proteins by “ painting ” a solution of lipid in organic solvent across an aperture , mueller and rudin were able to create an artificial bilayer and determine that this exhibited lateral fluidity , high electrical resistance and self-healing in response to puncture , all of which are properties of a natural cell membrane a few years later , alec bangham showed that bilayers , in the form of lipid vesicles , could also be formed simply by exposing a dried lipid sample to water
