numerous subspecies of falco peregrinus have been described , with 19 accepted by the 1994 handbook of the birds of the world , which considers the barbary falcon of the canary islands and coastal north africa to be two subspecies ( pelegrinoides and babylonicus ) of falco peregrinus , rather than a distinct species , f the following map shows the general ranges of these 19 subspecies , described by bonaparte in 1838 , is known as the american peregrine falcon , or '' duck hawk '' ; its scientific name means '' duck peregrine falcon '' it includes caucasicus and most specimens of the proposed race punicus , though others may be pelegrinoides ( barbary falcons ) , or perhaps the rare hybrids between these two which might occur around algeria it is found in the pacific northwest of north america , northwards from the puget sound along the british columbia coast ( including haida gwaii ) , along the gulf of alaska and the aleutian islands to the far eastern bering sea coast of russia , and may also occur on the kuril islands and the coasts of kamchatka , the nominate ( first-named ) subspecies , described by tunstall in 1771 , breeds over much of temperate eurasia between the tundra in the north and the pyrenees , mediterranean region and alpide belt in the south the barbary falcon has a peculiar way of flying , beating only the outer part of its wings like fulmars sometimes do ; this also occurs in the peregrine , but less often and far less pronounced the peregrine falcon reaches faster speeds than any other animal on the planet when performing the stoop , which involves soaring to a great height and then diving steeply at speeds of over , hitting one wing of its prey so as not to harm itself on impact the air pressure from such a dive could possibly damage a bird 's lungs , but small bony tubercles on a falcon 's nostrils are theorized to guide the powerful airflow away from the nostrils , enabling the bird to breathe more easily while diving by reducing the change in air pressure peregrine falcons have a flicker fusion threshold of 129 & nbsp ; hz ( cycles per second ) , very fast for a bird of its size , and much faster than mammals worldwide , it is estimated that between 1,500 and 2,000 bird species ( up to roughly a fifth of the world 's bird species ) are predated somewhere by these falcons ) to a sandhill crane ( killed in alaska by a peregrine in a stoop ) , although most prey taken by peregrines weigh from ( small passerines ) to ( such as ducks and gulls ) the peregrine falcon takes the most diverse range of bird species of any raptor in north america , with more than 300 species having fallen victim to the falcon , including nearly 100 shorebirds in urban areas , the main component of the peregrine 's diet is the rock or feral pigeon , which comprise 80 % or more of the dietary intake for peregrines in some cities other common city birds are also taken regularly , including mourning doves , common wood pigeons , common swifts , northern flickers , common starlings , american robins , common blackbirds , and corvids ( such as magpies or carrion , house , and american crows ) the peregrine requires open space in order to hunt , and therefore often hunts over open water , marshes , valleys , fields , and tundra , searching for prey either from a high perch or from the air prey is typically struck and captured in mid-air ; the peregrine falcon strikes its prey with a clenched foot , stunning or killing it with the impact , then turns to catch it in mid-air during the breeding season , the peregrine falcon is territorial ; nesting pairs are usually more than apart , and often much farther , even in areas with large numbers of pairs in many parts of its range , peregrines now also nest regularly on tall buildings or bridges ; these human-made structures used for breeding closely resemble the natural cliff ledges that the peregrine prefers for its nesting locations the pair defends the chosen nest site against other peregrines , and often against ravens , herons , and gulls , and if ground-nesting , also such mammals as foxes , wolverines , felids , bears , wolves , and mountain lions peregrines defending their nests have managed to kill raptors as large as golden eagles and bald eagles ( both of which they normally avoid as potential predators ) that have come too close to the nest by ambushing them in a full stoop the date of egg-laying varies according to locality , but is generally from february to march in the northern hemisphere , and from july to august in the southern hemisphere , although the australian subspecies macropus may breed as late as november , and equatorial populations may nest anytime between june and december if the eggs are lost early in the nesting season , the female usually lays another clutch , although this is extremely rare in the arctic due to the short summer season they are incubated for 29 to 33 days , mainly by the female , with the male also helping with the incubation of the eggs during the day , but only the female incubating them at night the average number of young found in nests is 2.5 , and the average number that fledge is about 1.5 , due to the occasional production of infertile eggs and various natural losses of nestlings the male ( called the '' '' ) and the female ( simply called the '' falcon '' ) both leave the nest to gather prey to feed the young the peregrine falcon is a highly admired falconry bird , and has been used in falconry for more than 3,000 years , beginning with nomads in central asia the peregrine falcon has the additional advantage of a natural flight style of circling above the falconer ( '' waiting on '' ) for game to be flushed , and then performing an effective and exciting high-speed diving stoop to take the quarry the speed of the stoop not only allows the falcon to catch fast flying birds , it also enhances the falcon 's ability to exert maneuvers to catch highly agile prey , and allows the falcon to deliver a knockout blow with a fist-like clenched talon against game that may be much larger than itself additionally the versatility of the species , with agility allowing capture of smaller birds and a strength and attacking style allowing capture of game much larger than themselves , combined with the wide size range of the many peregrine subspecies , means there is a subspecies suitable to almost any size and type of game bird this size range , evolved to fit various environments and prey species , is from the larger females of the largest subspecies to the smaller males of the smallest subspecies , approximately five to one ( approximately 1500 & nbsp ; g to 300 & nbsp ; g ) the males of smaller and medium-sized subspecies , and the females of the smaller subspecies , excel in the taking of swift and agile small game birds such as dove , quail , and smaller ducks the females of the larger subspecies are capable of taking large and powerful game birds such as the largest of duck species , pheasant , and grouse until 2004 nearly all peregrines used for falconry in the us were captive-bred from the progeny of falcons taken before the us endangered species act was enacted and from those few infusions of wild genes available from canada and special circumstances finally , after years of close work with the us fish and wildlife service , a limited take of wild peregrines was allowed in 2004 , the first wild peregrines taken specifically for falconry in over 30 years hybrids of peregrines and gyrfalcons are also available that can combine the best features of both species to create what many consider to be the ultimate falconry bird for the taking of larger game such as the sage-grouse the peregrine falcon became an endangered species over much of its range because of the use of organochlorine pesticides , especially ddt , during the 1950s , '60s , and '70s while high levels are still found in young birds ( only a few months old ) and even higher concentrations are found in more mature falcons , further increasing in adult peregrine falcons in several parts of the world , such as the eastern united states and belgium , this species became extirpated ( locally extinct ) as a result following the ban of organochlorine pesticides , the reproductive success of peregrines increased in scotland in terms of territory occupancy and breeding success , although spatial variation in recovery rates indicate that in some areas peregrines were also impacted by other factors such as persecution to release a captive-bred falcon , the bird is placed in a special cage at the top of a tower or cliff ledge for some days or so , allowing it to acclimate itself to its future environment due to the extirpation of the eastern anatum ( falco peregrinus anatum ) , the near extirpation of the anatum in the midwest , and the limited gene pool within north american breeding stock , the inclusion of non-native subspecies was justified to optimize the genetic diversity found within the species as a whole however , the genetic diversity of peregrines in finland is similar to other populations , indicating that high dispersal rates have maintained the genetic diversity of this species in canada , where peregrines were identified as endangered in 1978 ( in the yukon territory of northern canada that year , only a single breeding pair was identified ) , the committee on the status of endangered wildlife in canada declared the species no longer at risk in december 2017 peregrines now breed in many mountainous and coastal areas , especially in the west and north , and nest in some urban areas , capitalising on the urban feral pigeon populations for food in southampton , a nest prevented restoration of mobile telephony services for several months , after vodafone engineers despatched to repair a faulty transmitter mast discovered a nest in the mast , and were prevented by the wildlife and countryside act – on pain of a possible prison sentence – from proceeding with repairs until the chicks fledged 800–1500 ) used the peregrine , along with several other birds of prey , in imagery as a symbol of '' aerial ( celestial ) power '' and buried men of high status in costumes associating to the ferocity of raptorial birds in the late middle ages , the western european nobility that used peregrines for hunting , considered the bird associated with princes in formal hierarchies of birds of prey , just below the gyrfalcon associated with kings admirers of the book include robert macfarlane , landmarks , robert macfarlane , hamish hamilton , london , 2015 , chapter 5 mark cocker , who regards the book as '' one of the most outstanding books on nature in the twentieth century '' birds britannica , mark cocker & richard mabey london : chatto & windus , 2005 , , page 150 and werner herzog , who called it '' the one book i would ask you to read if you want to make films '' , and said elsewhere '' it has prose of the calibre that we have not seen since joseph conrad '' in the book , baker recounts , in diary form , his detailed observations of peregrines ( and their interaction with other birds ) near his home in chelmsford , essex , over a single winter from october to april list of birds by flight speed perilanner , a hybrid of the peregrine falcon and the lanner falcon ( falco biarmicus ) perlin , a hybrid of the peregrine falcon and the merlin ( falco columbarius )
