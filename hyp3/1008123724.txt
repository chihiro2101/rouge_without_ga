this allows for the transmission of a large amount of signal energy without interfering with conventional narrowband and carrier wave transmission in the same frequency band regulatory limits in many countries allow for this efficient use of radio bandwidth , and enable high-data-rate personal area network ( pan ) wireless connectivity , longer-range low-data-rate applications , and radar and imaging systems , transparently with existing communications systems ultra-wideband was formerly known as pulse radio , but the fcc and the international telecommunication union radiocommunication sector ( itu-r ) currently define uwb as an antenna transmission for which emitted signal bandwidth exceeds the lesser of 500 & nbsp ; mhz or 20 % of the arithmetic center frequency characteristics of ultra-wideband technology thus , pulse-based systems—where each transmitted pulse occupies the uwb bandwidth ( or an aggregate of at least 500 & nbsp ; mhz of narrow-band carrier ; for example , orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing ( ofdm ) ) —can access the uwb spectrum under the rules a significant difference between conventional radio transmissions and uwb is that conventional systems transmit information by varying the power level , frequency , and/or phase of a sinusoidal wave arl has also investigated the feasibility of whether uwb radar technology can incorporate doppler processing to estimate the velocity of a moving target when the platform is stationary while a 2013 report highlighted the issue with the use of uwb waveforms due to target range migration during the integration interval , more recent studies have suggested that uwb waveforms can demonstrate better performance compared to conventional doppler processing as long as a correct matched filter is used ultra-wideband is also used in '' see-through-the-wall '' precision radar-imaging technology , thales group 's through-the-wall imaging system michal aftanas through-wall imaging with uwb radar system dissertation thesis , 2009 precision locating and tracking ( using distance measurements between radios ) , and precision time-of-arrival-based localization approaches ultra-wideband characteristics are well-suited to short-range applications , such as wireless usb , such as wireless monitors , camcorders , wireless printing , and file transfers to portable media players slow progress in uwb standards development , the cost of initial implementation , and performance significantly lower than initially expected are several reasons for the limited use of uwb in consumer products ( which caused several uwb vendors to cease operations in 2008 and 2009 ) in the usa , ultra-wideband refers to radio technology with a bandwidth exceeding the lesser of 500 & nbsp ; mhz or 20 % of the arithmetic center frequency , according to the u.s however , the emission limit for uwb emitters may be significantly lower ( as low as −75 & nbsp ; dbm/mhz ) in other segments of the spectrum narrowband signals that exist in the uwb range such as the ieee802.11a transmitters may exhibit a high power spectral density ( psd ) levels compared to the psd of uwb signals as seen by a uwb receiver
