groups of risk some population groups have a higher choking risk , as : the elderly , the children , the disabled ( physically or mentally ) , people under the effects of alcohol or drugs , people who have taken medications that seriously reduce the ability to salivate or react , patients with difficulties to swallow ( dysphagia ) , suicidal people , epileptics , people on the autism spectrum , individuals with disorders such as pica that lead them to consume inedible objects , etc when babies choke on deflated balloons or plastic bags ( as the sacks for wrapping the dirty diapers , the nappy sacks , which are a sort of bag sometimes dangerously placed near the babies ) , it produces a complicated obstruction that would require it to be directly removed with the fingers , if it is visible caregivers can avoid giving children , when they are younger than 5 years-old , foods that pose a high risk of choking such as hot dog pieces , bananas , cheese sticks , cheese chunks , hard candy , nuts , grapes , marshmallows or popcorn to swallow well , it is recommended that the neck is in a normal position , straight for the eater 's body , with the head looking forward , being seated or standing up ( not lying or too reclined ) dangerous foods the foods that produce the most complicated choking are those whose shape adapts to the shape of the pharynx or trachea : hot dogs and sausages , bananas , food in blocks , etc if the choking individual is conscious and coughing , the american red cross recommends encouraging the individual to stay calm and continue coughing freely , and it may be easier to take air through the nose to refill the lungs caregivers can try to prevent choking by considering the features of a toy ( such as size , shape , consistency , small parts ) before giving it to a child small , round non-food objects such as balls , marbles , toys , and toy parts are also associated with a high risk of choking death because of their potential to completely block a child 's airway in addition , a child 's airway is smaller in diameter than an adult 's airway , which means that smaller objects can cause an airway obstruction in children children and adults with neurological , cognitive , or psychiatric disorders may experience a delay in diagnosis because there may not be a known history of a foreign body entering the airway for the conscious choking victim , most protocols recommend encouraging the victim to cough , followed by hard back slaps and , if none of these things work , abdominal thrusts ( heimlich maneuver ) or chest thrusts foods that pose a high risk of choking include hot dogs , hard candy , nuts , seeds , whole grapes , raw carrots , apples , popcorn , peanut butter , marshmallows , chewing gum , and sausages if a food can be chewed , it must be chewed , whatever it is , even if it is very soft or gelatinous , such as spreads and soft desserts ) , they may need to be eaten together with something that helps the teeth to grind them ( as loaf bread ) , or any concrete way to be prepared or cooked this risk disappears when one obtains the discipline to split the food in pieces of moderated size , and to chew them completely , not swallowing them before in one study , peanuts were the most common object found in the airway of children evaluated for suspected foreign body aspiration parents , teachers , child care providers and other caregivers for children are advised to be trained in choking first-aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( cpr )
