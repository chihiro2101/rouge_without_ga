in most modern western legal systems , judges often instruct juries to act only as '' finder of fact '' , whose role it is to determine the veracity of the evidence presented , the weight accorded to the evidence , to apply that evidence to the law as explained by the judge , and to reach a verdict ; but not to question the law itself some commonly cited historical examples of jury nullification involve jurors refusing to convict persons accused of violating the fugitive slave act by assisting runaway slaves or being fugitive slaves themselves , and refusal of american colonial juries to convict a defendant under english law in the united states , some view the requirement that jurors take an oath to be unlawful in itself , while still others view the oath 's reference to '' deliverance '' to require nullification of unjust law : '' will well and truly try and a true deliverance make between the united states and the defendant at the bar , and a true verdict render according to the evidence , so help me god '' they point to the danger that a jury may choose to convict a defendant who has not broken the letter of the law jury nullification may also occur in civil suits , in which the verdict is generally a finding of liability or lack of liability ( rather than a finding of guilty or not guilty ) the general power of juries to decide on verdicts was recognised in the english magna carta magna carta of 1215 of 1215 , which put into words existing practices : largely , the earliest juries returned verdicts in accordance with the judge or the crown in addition , the writ of attaint allowed a judge to retry the case in front of a second jury when the judge believed the first jury returned a '' false verdict '' almost a century later in 1649 , in the first known attempt to argue for jury nullification , a jury likewise acquitted john lilburne for his part in inciting a rebellion against the cromwell regime the theoretician and politician eduard bernstein wrote of lilburne 's trial : in 1653 , lilburne was on trial again and asked the jury to acquit him if it found the death penalty '' unconscionably severe '' in proportion to the crime he had committed in scotland , jury nullification had the profound effect of introducing the three-verdict system including the option of '' not proven '' , which remains in scotland to this day as the defendant had undoubtedly killed the earl , the law ( as it stood ) required the jury merely to look at the facts and pass a verdict of '' proven '' or '' not proven '' depending on whether they believed the facts proved the defendant had killed the earl to avert this injustice , the jury decided to assert what it believed to be their '' ancient right '' to judge the whole case and not just the facts , rendering the verdict of '' not guilty '' now the '' not guilty '' verdict has become the normal verdict when a jury is convinced of innocence and the '' not proven '' verdict is only used when the jury is not certain of innocence or guilt standard jury trial practice in the united states during the founding era and for several decades afterward was to argue all issues of law in the presence of the jury , so that the jury heard the same arguments the bench did in reaching his rulings on motions this transition began with motions in limine , to exclude evidence on which it was felt the jury should not hear the argument because they would be informed of the evidence to be excluded later that was expanded to include all legal argument , so that today , that earlier practice of arguing law before the jury has been largely forgotten , and judges even declare mistrials or overturn verdicts if legal argument is made to the jury within this decision , it is stated that '' juries are not entitled as a matter of right to refuse to apply the law—but they do have the power to do so when their consciences permit of no other course '' the jury was then subsequently kept for three days without '' meat , drink , fire and tobacco '' to force them to bring in a guilty verdict ; when they failed to do so the judge ended the trial chief justice vaughan , sitting on the court of common pleas , discharged the writ , released them , called the power to punish a jury '' absurd '' , and forbade judges from punishing jurors for returning a verdict the judge disagreed with & nbsp ; 824 , lord mansfield disparaged the practice of jury nullification : a 2016 study exploring the history of juror punishment in england and wales after bushel 's case found no clear examples of jurors being punished solely for returning the '' wrong '' verdict '' the foreman , george lathan , considered that to a form of punishment for the jury , as the jurors were not going to be permitted to serve on any more juries but were nonetheless required to keep attending court or face contempt proceedings home office officials wrote to the judge , advising him that his actions '' would be impossible for the home secretary to defend as constitutional or right '' , and after several days , the jurors were relieved of their duties his main defence , that it was in the public interest that the information be made available , was rejected on the grounds that '' the public interest is what the government of the day says it is '' , but the jury acquitted him , much to the consternation of the government in a well-known example of jury nullification , at the end of wild bill hickok 's trial for the manslaughter of davis tutt in 1865 , judge sempronius boyd gave the jury two instructions a jury nullification advocacy group estimates that 3–4 % of all jury trials involve nullification , and a recent rise in hung jury is seen by some as being indirect evidence that juries have begun to consider the validity or fairness of the laws themselves . this decision , often cited , has led to a common practice by united states judges to penalize anyone who attempts to present a nullification argument to jurors and to declare a mistrial if such argument has been presented to them moylan , 417 f.2d 1002 ( 4th cir.1969 ) , the court affirmed the concept of jury nullification , but upheld the power of a court to refuse to permit an instruction to the jury to this effect dougherty , 473 f.2d 1113 , the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit issued a ruling similar to moylan that affirmed the de facto power of a jury to nullify the law but upheld the denial of the defense 's chance to instruct the jury about the power to nullify on october 24 , 2014 , the new hampshire supreme court effectively nullified the law , holding that the wording of the statute does not allow defense attorneys to tell juries they can '' nullify '' a law the indiana constitution allows nullification , but does not require informing the jury of this right : '' in all criminal cases whatever , the jury shall have the right to determine the law and the facts '' organizations fija - the fully informed jury association , an activist group that encourages educating potential jurors about jury nullification articles and other works '' cromwell and communism '' aka socialism and democracy in the great english revolution jury nullification by doug linder jury nullification : why you should know what it is by russ emal essay on the trial by jury by lysander spooner bushell 's case , history of bushell 's case and jury nullification in its aftermath how to get out of jury duty ( satirical defense of jury powers ) history of trial by jury , william forsyth
