in general , if the nature of the population distribution is known a priori , it is possible to test if the number of outliers deviate significantly from what can be expected : for a given cutoff ( so samples fall beyond the cutoff with probability p ) of a given distribution , the number of outliers will follow a binomial distribution with parameter p , which can generally be well-approximated by the poisson distribution with λ pn in a sample of 1000 observations , the presence of up to five observations deviating from the mean by more than three times the standard deviation is within the range of what can be expected , being less than twice the expected number and hence within 1 standard deviation of the expected number – see poisson distribution – and not indicate an anomaly model-based methods which are commonly used for identification assume that the data are from a normal distribution , and identify observations which are deemed '' unlikely '' based on mean and standard deviation : chauvenet 's criterion grubbs 's test for outliers dixon 's q test astm e178 standard practice for dealing with outlying observations mahalanobis distance and leverage are often used to detect outliers , especially in the development of linear regression models the principle upon which it is proposed to solve this problem is , that the proposed observations should be rejected when the probability of the system of errors obtained by retaining them is less than that of the system of errors obtained by their rejection multiplied by the probability of making so many , and no more , abnormal observations deletion of outlier data is a controversial practice frowned upon by many scientists and science instructors ; while mathematical criteria provide an objective and quantitative method for data rejection , they do not make the practice more scientifically or methodologically sound , especially in small sets or where a normal distribution can not be assumed in the case of normal distribution data , the three sigma rule means that roughly 1 in 22 observations will differ by twice the standard deviation or more from the mean , and 1 in 370 will deviate by three times the standard deviation from mathworld -- a wolfram web resource the sample variance increases with the sample size , the sample mean fails to converge as the sample size increases , and outliers are expected at far larger rates than for a normal distribution in cases where the cause of the outliers is known , it may be possible to incorporate this effect into the model structure , for example by using a hierarchical bayes model , or a mixture model for example , if q_1 and q_3 are the lower and upper quartiles respectively , then one could define an outlier to be any observation outside the range : : \big q_1 - k ( q_3 - q_1 ) , q_3 + k ( q_3 - q_1 ) \big for some nonnegative constant k even when a normal distribution model is appropriate to the data being analyzed , outliers are expected for large sample sizes and should not automatically be discarded if that is the case the strength of this method lies in the fact that it takes into account a data set 's standard deviation , average and provides a statistically determined rejection zone ; thus providing an objective method to determine if a data point is an outlier thus if one takes a normal distribution with cutoff 3 standard deviations from the mean , p is approximately 0.3 % , and thus for 1000 trials one can approximate the number of samples whose deviation exceeds 3 sigmas by a poisson distribution with λ 3 additionally , the pathological appearance of outliers of a certain form appears in a variety of datasets , indicating that the causative mechanism for the data might differ at the extreme end ( king effect )
