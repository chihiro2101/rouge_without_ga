other attempts included moving the seat rearward and driving the wheel by levers or treadles , as in the '' xtraordinary '' and '' facile '' , or gears , by chain as in the '' kangaroo '' or at the hub , as in the '' crypto '' ; another option was to move the seat well back , as in the '' rational '' makers developed '' moustache '' handlebars , allowing the rider 's knees to clear them , '' whatton '' handlebars that wrapped around behind the legs , and ultimately ( though too late , after development of the safety bicycle ) , the american '' eagle '' and '' star '' bicycles , whose large and small wheels were reversed james starley had built the ariel ( spirit of the air ) high-wheeler in 1870 ; but this was a time of innovation , and when chain drives were upgraded so that each link had a small roller , higher and higher speeds became possible without the large wheel the bike , with the one wheel dominating , led to riders being referred to in america as '' wheelmen '' , a name that lived on for nearly a century in the league of american wheelmen until renamed the league of american bicyclists in 1994 in 1885 , starley 's nephew john kemp starley took these new developments to launch the modern bicycle , the rover safety bicycle , so-called because the rider , seated much lower and farther behind the front wheel contact point , was less prone to a header eugène meyer of paris , france is now regarded as the father of the high bicycle by the international cycling history conference in place of james starley a new type of handlebar was introduced , called whatton bars , that looped behind the legs so that riders could still keep their feet on the pedals and also be able to leap forward feet-first off the machine the first was the chain drive , originally used on tricycles , allowing a gear ratio to be chosen independent of the wheel size a 60-inch gear , the largest practicable size for a high-wheeler , is nowadays a middle gear of a utility bicycle , while top gears on many exceed 100 & nbsp ; inches instead of using gears to multiply the revolutions of the pedals , the driven wheel is enlarged to be close to the rider 's inseam , to increase the maximum speed in 1967 collectors and restorers of penny-farthings ( and other early bicycles ) founded the wheelmen , a non-profit organization '' dedicated to keeping alive the heritage of american cycling '' in 1885–86 , he continued from london through europe , the middle east , china , and japan , to become the first to ride around the world each february in evandale , tasmania , penny-farthing enthusiasts from around the world converge on the small village for a series of penny-farthing races , including the national championship for example , when cyclist thomas stevens rode around the world in the 1880s , he reported only one significant mechanical problem in over , caused when the local military confiscated his bicycle and damaged the front wheel while it was a difficult , dangerous machine , it was simpler , lighter , and faster than the safer velocipedes of the time this shifts the rider nearly on top of the wheel and makes it impossible for the rider to reach the ground while sitting on the seat a penny-farthing is the logo of the village in the cult 1960s television series the prisoner , and is also featured in the show 's closing titles these are calculated by multiplying the wheel diameter in inches by the number of teeth on the front chain-wheel and dividing by the teeth on the rear sprocket penny-farthing bicycles often used similar materials and construction as earlier velocipedes : cast iron frames , solid rubber tires , and plain bearings for pedals , steering , and wheels the penny-farthing used a larger wheel than the velocipede , thus giving higher speeds on all but the steepest hills
