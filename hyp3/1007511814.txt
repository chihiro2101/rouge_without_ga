james rice 's 2012 narrative tales from a revolution : bacon 's rebellion and the transformation of early america , whose emphasis on bacon 's flaws echoes the governor and the rebel , integrates the rebellion into a larger story emphasizing the actions of multiple native americans , as well as placing it in the context of politics in europe ; in this telling , the climax of bacon 's rebellion comes with the '' glorious revolution '' of 1688/89 this understanding of the conflict was reflected in 20th-century commemorations , including a memorial window in colonial williamsburg , and a prominent tablet in the virginia house of delegates chamber of the state capitol in richmond , which recalls bacon as '' a great patriot leader of the virginia people who died while defending their rights october 26 , 1676 john berry , francis moryson , and herbert jefferys , '' a true narrative of the rise , progress and cessation of the late rebellion in virginia , most humbly an impartially recorded by his majesties commissioners , appointed to inquire into the affairs of the said colony '' , ed john berry , francis moryson , and herbert jefferys , '' a true narrative of the rise , progress and cessation of the late rebellion in virginia , most humbly and impartially recorded by his majesties commissioners , appointed to inquire into the affairs of the said colony morgan 's classic 1975 american slavery , american freedom connected the calamity of bacon 's rebellion , namely the potential for lower-class revolt , with the colony 's transition over to slavery : '' but for those with eyes to see , there was an obvious lesson in the rebellion '' nonetheless , many in the early united states , including thomas jefferson , saw bacon as a patriot and believed that bacon 's rebellion truly was a prelude to the later american revolution against the control of the crown according to the historic jamestowne national park website , '' for many years , historians considered the virginia rebellion of 1676 to be the first stirring of revolutionary sentiment in north america , which culminated in the american revolution almost exactly one hundred years later peter thompson , '' the thief , the householder , and the commons : languages of class in seventeenth-century virginia , '' william and mary quarterly ( 2006 ) 63 2 pp robert beverley reported , in his 1705 book on the history of virginia , that some soldiers who had been dispatched to jamestown to quell bacon 's rebellion gathered and ate leaves of datura stramonium , and spent eleven days acting in bizarre and foolish ways before recovering rather than singing bacon 's praises and chastising berkeley 's tyranny , washburn found the roots of the rebellion in the colonists ' intolerable demand to '' authorize the slaughter and dispossession of the innocent as well as the guilty '' the fear of civil war among whites frightened virginia 's ruling elite , who took steps to consolidate power and improve their image : for example , restoration of property qualifications for voting , reducing taxes , and adoption of a more aggressive american indian policy the most idolizing portrait of bacon is found in torchbearer of the revolution ( 1940 ) by thomas jefferson wertenbaker , which one scholar in 2011 called '' one of the worst books on virginia that a reputable scholarly historian ever published by charles andrews , in narrative of the insurrections 1675 to 1690 , ( charles scribner 's sons : new york , 1915 ) , 116 139 berkeley left his wife , frances berkeley , in virginia and returned to england ; she sent a letter to let him know that the current governor was making a bet that the king would refuse to receive him it leveled several accusations against berkeley : that '' upon specious pretense of public works he raised great unjust taxes upon the commonality '' ; advancing favorites to high public offices ; monopolizing the beaver trade with the native americans ; being pro-native american his wife described green spring in a letter to her cousin : it looked like one of those the boys pull down at shrovetide , and was almost as much to repair as if it had been new to build , and no sign that ever there had been a fence around it however , in the past few decades , based on findings from a more distant viewpoint , historians have come to understand bacon 's rebellion as a power struggle between two stubborn , selfish leaders rather than a glorious fight against tyranny historians believe the rebellion hastened the hardening of racial lines associated with slavery , as a way for planters and the colony to control some of the poor thousands of virginians from all classes ( including those in indentured servitude ) and races rose up in arms against berkeley , chasing him from jamestown and ultimately torching the settlement bacon 's followers used the rebellion as an effort to gain government recognition of the shared interests among all social classes of the colony in protecting the '' commonality '' and advancing its welfare sakai , '' settlers : the mythology of the white proletariat from mayflower to modern , '' ( 2014 ) p by charles andrews , in narrative of the insurrections 1675 to 1690 , new york : charles scribner 's sons , 1915 , pp
