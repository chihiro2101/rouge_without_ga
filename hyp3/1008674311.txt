this is often carried out without note of a reference frame , or with the implicit assumption that the reference frame is local ; as such , this would require either accurate teleportation , as a rotating planet , being under acceleration , is not an inertial frame , or for the time machine to remain in the same place , its contents 'frozen ' in physics , a world line of an object ( approximated as a point in space , e.g for example , the orbit of the earth in space is approximately a circle , a three-dimensional ( closed ) curve in space : the earth returns every year to the same point in space relative to the sun the use of world lines in general relativity is basically the same as in special relativity , with the difference that spacetime can be curved the event is then represented by a point in a minkowski diagram , which is a plane usually plotted with the time coordinate , say t , upwards and the space coordinate , say x horizontally the world line of the earth is helix in spacetime ( a curve in a four-dimensional space ) and does not return to the same point a space armada trying to complete a ( nearly ) closed time-like path as a strategic maneuver forms the backdrop and a main plot device of '' singularity sky '' by charles stross each point of a world line is an event that can be labeled with the time and the spatial position of the object at that time the world sheet of an open string ( with loose ends ) is a strip ; that of a closed string ( a loop ) resembles a tube it was advertised to be a '' mathematical fantasy '' â€”and it was ! the substance of the exercise was as follows : he postulated that , commencing with his birth , every human being had some kind of spiritual aura with a long filament or thread attached , that traveled behind him throughout his life world lines of free-falling particles or objects ( such as planets around the sun or an astronaut in space ) are called geodesics '' heinlein 's methuselah 's children uses the term , as does james blish 's the quincunx of time ( expanded from '' beep '' ) in time , there stretches behind you more of this space-time event , reaching to perhaps nineteen-sixteen , of which we see a cross-section here at right angles to the time axis , and as thick as the present , a particle or observer ) is the sequence of spacetime events corresponding to the history of the object any timelike curve admits a proper frame whose '' time axis '' corresponds to that curve , and , since no observer is privileged , we can always find a local coordinate system in which lightcones are inclined at 45 degrees to the time axis
