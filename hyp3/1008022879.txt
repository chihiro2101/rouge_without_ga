it likely entered english as a gambling term , and the context of gambling remains detectable in the word 's connotations ; luck is a way of understanding a personal chance event '' luck accordingly involves three things : ( 1 ) a beneficiary or maleficiary , ( 2 ) a development that is benign ( positive ) or malign ( negative ) from the stand point of the interests of the affected individual , and that , moreover , ( 3 ) is fortuitous ( unexpected , chancy , unforeseeable the definition in the oxford english dictionary : '' the fortuitous happening of an event favorable or unfavorable to the interest of a person '' rescher , n '' luck thus always incorporates a normative element of good or bad : someone must be affected positively or negatively by an event before its realization can properly be called lucky before the adoption of luck at the end of the middle ages , old english and middle english expressed the notion of '' good fortune '' with the word speed ( middle english spede , old english spēd ) ; speed besides '' good fortune '' had the wider meaning of '' prosperity , profit , abundance '' ; it is not associated with the notion of probability or chance but rather with that of fate or divine help ; a bestower of success can also be called speed , as in '' christ be our speed '' ( william robertson , phraseologia generalis , 1693 ) the notion of probability was expressed by the latin loanword chance , adopted in middle english from the late 13th century , literally describing an outcome as a '' falling '' ( as it were of dice ) , via old french cheance from late latin cadentia '' falling '' fortuna , the roman goddess of fate or luck , was popular an allegory in medieval times , and even though it was not strictly reconcilable with christian theology , it became popular in learned circles of the high middle ages to portray her as a servant of god in distributing success or failure in a characteristically '' fickle '' or unpredictable way , thus introducing the notion of chance this view incorporates phenomena that are chance happenings , a person 's place of birth for example , but where there is no uncertainty involved , or where the uncertainty is irrelevant within this framework , one can differentiate between three different types of luck : constitutional luck , that is , luck with factors that can not be changed to a rationalist , a believer in luck who asserts that something has influenced his or her luck commits the '' post hoc ergo propter hoc '' logical fallacy : that because two events are connected sequentially , they are connected causally as well more contemporary authors writing on the subject believe that the definition of good destiny is : one who enjoys good health ; has the physical and mental capabilities of achieving his goals in life ; has good appearance , and ; has happiness in mind and is not prone to accidents '' we know it would be superstitious to believe that '' there actually is such a thing as luck '' - something a rabbits ' foot might bring - but we nevertheless think there is an unsuperstitious and unmisleading way of characterising events and properties as merely lucky abrahamic religions believe god controls future events ; belief in luck or fate is criticised in book of isaiah chapter 65 , verses 11-12 : what will happen to you for offering food and wine to the gods you call good luck and fate ? your luck will end christianity , in its early development , accommodated many traditional practices which at different times , accepted omens and practiced forms of ritual sacrifice in order to divine the will of their supreme being or to influence divine favoritism the concepts of '' divine grace '' or '' blessing '' as they are described by believers closely resemble what is referred to as '' luck '' by others mesoamerican religions , such as the aztecs , mayans and incas , had particularly strong beliefs regarding the relationship between rituals and the gods , which could in a similar sense to abrahamic religions be called luck or providence in these cultures , human sacrifice ( both of willing volunteers and captured enemies ) , as well as self-sacrifice by means of bloodletting , could possibly be seen as a way to propitiate the gods and earn favor for the city offering the sacrifice an alternative interpretation would be that the sacrificial blood was considered as a necessary element for the gods to maintain the proper working order of the universe , in the same way that oil would be applied to an automobile to keep it working as designed in personality psychology , people reliably differ from each other depending on four key aspects : beliefs in luck , rejection of luck , being lucky , and being unlucky the philosopher nicholas rescher has proposed that the luck of someone 's result in a situation of uncertainty is measured by the difference between this party 's yield and expectation : λ y - e for example , chess does not involve any random factors ( beyond the determination of which player moves first ) , while the outcome of snakes and ladders is entirely based on random dice rolls luck is positive ( good luck ) if the player 's position is improved and negative ( bad luck ) if it is worsened this is found to be particularly strong in asian cultures , where the obtaining of '' lucky '' telephone numbers , automobile license plate numbers , and address ( geography ) are actively sought , sometimes at great money expense it is interrelated to astrology , and to some degree to parapsychology and spirituality and is based on converting virtually anything material into a pure number , using that number in an attempt to detect something meaningful about reality , and trying to predict or calculate the future based on lucky numbers richard wiseman did a ten-year scientific study into the nature of luck that has revealed that , to a large extent , people make their own good and bad fortune they are skilled at creating and noticing chance opportunities , making lucky decisions by listening to their intuition , creating self-fulfilling prophecies via positive expectations , and adopting a resilient attitude that transforms bad luck into good moreover , in much of this previous work , luck is manipulated in a way that is very likely to elicit positive affect as well thus , it is difficult to articulate whether the observed effects of luck are due to chronic beliefs about luck , temporary changes in how lucky people feel , or because of changes caused by the positive affect that is experienced it was also found that the effects of priming luck using subliminal messages increased participants ' estimates of the likelihood of favorable events , their participation in lotteries , the amount of money they invested in relatively risky financial options and these effects appeared to be mediated by temporary changes in perceptions of luck rather than by affect ) he taught that all things which happen must have a cause , either material or spiritual , and do not occur due to luck , chance or fate in the sutta nipata , the buddha is recorded as having said the following about selling luck : whereas some religious men , while living of food provided by the faithful make their living by such low arts , such wrong means of livelihood as palmistry , divining by signs , interpreting dreams ahab 's death was not merely the result of a randomly shot arrow , but as 2 chronicles 18 reveals , god actively directed the events that led ahab into battle and used that randomly shot arrow to accomplish his intended will for ahab that day it is also involved in the evil that god allowed joseph 's brothers to do to joseph in order to accomplish a greater good , a good not apparent to joseph until years later ( genesis 50:20 ) there are five causes of all actions as given in the samkhya wisdom ; says gita— “ the physical body ( adhisthana ) , the lower ’ i am ’ ( karta ) , the means of perception ( karanam ) , the varied multiple efforts ( vividhasch pruthak cheshta ) and the cosmic wheel of action ( daivam ) , these five sources together are responsible for success or failure of any action “ the definition which is much closer to the concept of luck in islam is '' a force that brings good fortune or adversity '' quran 17-13 ( isra ) : '' and ( for ) every man we have fastened to him his fate ( fortune ) in his neck , and we will bring forth for him ( on the ) day ( of ) the resurrection a record which he will find wide open '' however , there is a very long discussion on how this prefixed destiny , fortune or luck defines attitudes and living behavior and so as to how much amends one can make in this predetermined fate by one 's own contribution through positive actions in accordance with the teachings of islam it is stated in the qur'an ( sura : adh-dhariyat ( the winds that scatter ) verse:22 ) that one 's sustenance is pre-determined in heaven when the lord says : '' and in the heaven is your provision and that which ye are promised however , in the arabic language there is a word which directly means '' luck '' , which is , and a related word for '' lucky '' , it is also forbidden to believe in luck or anything else related to luck , as it is classified as shirk ( associating partners to allah or giving any share of any attribution which belongs to allah and allah alone ) they define disbelief in luck as '' a tendency to agree with the rational view of luck as random and unreliable '' ( p proposed a 6-dimensional model of beliefs around luck , but empirical analyses supported only a 4-dimensional model : belief in being personally lucky ; belief in being personally unlucky ; general belief in luck ; and rejection of belief in luck image : barnstarproud.jpg thumb right a barnstar , mounted on a wall , is seen as a lucky symbol in some parts of north america thompson and prendergast ( 2013 ) thompson , e they addressed the logical problem that nobody who disbelieves in luck could consider themselves lucky by differentiating between belief in luck as a deterministic phenomenon that affects the future , on one hand , and on the other , belief in personal luckiness as an appraisal of how fortunately or otherwise chance events in the past might have turned out
