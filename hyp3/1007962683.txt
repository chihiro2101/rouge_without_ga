zygos is greek for '' joining '' or '' a yoke '' , referring to the fusion of two hyphae which produces these spores , and -mycota is a suffix referring to a division of fungi the american mycologist and geneticist albert francis blakeslee discovered that some species of mucorales were self-sterile ( heterothallic ) , in which interactions of two strains , designated ( + ) and ( - ) , are necessary for the initiation of sexual activity the resulting asymmetric distribution of the cytoplasm is proposed to generate increased wall growth on the lower side of horizonally placed sporangiophores as in the thicker cytoplasmic layer forming there the number of vesicles secreting cell-wall material would be higher than on the upper side zygophores are chemotropic aerial hyphae that are the sex organs of zygomycota , except for phycomyces in which they are not aerial but found in the substratum in the next stage , septae are established to limit the developing zygospore from the vegetative mycelium and in this way the zygophores become suspensor hyphae and gametangia are formed furthermore , while the majority of the zygomycetes only grow at high water activities , some of them are able to grow in salt concentrations of at least 15 % they are formed in specialized structures , the mitosporangia ( sporangia ) that contain few to several thousand of spores , depending on the species therefore , specialized vesicles , the chitosomes , bring precursors of chitin and its synthesizing enzyme , chitin synthetase , to the outside of the membrane by exocytosis this , coupled with further evidence , has led to the assumption that trisporoids are not strictly species-specific , but that they might represent the general principle of mating recognition in mucorales growth of the gametangia commences after gametangia come in contact , and plasmogamy , or the fusion of the cytoplasm , occurs trisporic acid , as the endpoint of this recognition pathway , can solely be produced in presence of both compatible partners , which enzymatically produce trisporoid precursors to be further utilized by the potential sexual partner the name zygomycota refers to the zygosporangia characteristically formed by the members of this clade , in which resistant spherical spores are formed during sexual reproduction when light , particularly blue light , is involved in the regulation of fungal development , it directs the growth of fungal structures and activates metabolic pathways in some cases , there may be a few as three spores in each sporangiolum , and a few species have sporangiola which contain just a single spore this interaction was found by hans burgeff of the university of goettingen to be due to the exchange of low molecular weight substances that diffused through the substratum and atmosphere most of them are mesophilic ( growing at 10–40 & nbsp ; °c with an optimum 20–35 & nbsp ; °c ) , but some , like mucor miehei or mucor pusillus , are thermophilic with a minimum growth temperature of about 20 & nbsp ; °c and maximum extending up to 60 & nbsp ; °c the elucidation of the hormonal control of sexual interaction in the mucorales extends over 60 years and involved mycologists and biochemists from germany , italy , the netherlands , the uk and the usa choanephora , a zygomycete , has a sporangiolum that contains one spore with a sporangium wall that is visible at the base of the sporangium the evolution of sporangiospores typical of zygomycetes to conidia similar to those found in ascomycetes can be modeled by a series of forms seen in zygomycetes during continuous irradiation with unilateral light , the sporangiophore ( fruiting body ) of the zygomycete fungus , phycomyces blakesleeanus reach a bending angle of photogravitropic equilibrium at which the gravitropic and phototropic stimuli balance each other ( fig once contact between the zygophores has been made , their walls adhere to each other , flatten and then the contact site is referred to as the fusion septum species specificity of these reactions is among others obtained by spatial segregation , physicochemical features of derivatives ( volatility and light sensitivity ) , chemical modifications of trisporoids and transcriptional/posttranscriptional regulation early trisporoid derivatives and trisporic acid induce swelling of two potential hyphae , hence called zygophores , and a chemical gradient of these inducer molecules results in a growth towards each other the two genes for the enzymes phytoene desaturase ( carb ) and the bifunctional phytoene synthase/carotene cyclase ( carra in phycomyces , carrp in mucor ) are responsible for synthesis of beta-carotene sliding along during sedimentation or pulling at the vacuolar membranes and transepts serves as an inter-cellular signal to a probable cytoskeleton response , and that activates receptors located in the cell membrane the primary function of chlamydospores is the persistence of the mycelium and they are released when the mycelium degrades some species of the order mucorales are able to grow under anaerobic conditions , while most of them require aerobic conditions many morphological similarities in comparison to zygospore formation are seen , but the mature spore is called a sikyospore and is parasitic for instance , the zygomycota use light as signal to promote vegetative reproduction and growth of aerial hyphae to facilitate spore dispersal the only model for the mechanism of the gravitropic reaction of phycomyces is based on the floatability of the vacuole within the surrounding cytoplasm pilobolus , a fungus which grows on animal dung , bends its sporangiophores towards light with the help of a light sensitive pigment ( beta-carotene ) and then '' fires '' them with an explosive squirt of high-pressure cytoplasm sporangia can be launched as far as 2 & nbsp ; m , placing them far away from the dung and hopefully on vegetation which will be eaten by an herbivore , eventually to be deposited with dung elsewhere the product of the gene crga , which was found in mucor suppresses the carotene formation by inhibiting the accumulation of carb and carrp mrnas this structure is similar to a conidium , which has two , fused cell walls , an inner spore wall and an outer sporangium wall sexual reproduction in rhizopus stolonifer , as in other zygomycetes , occurs when haploid hyphae of different mating types are in close proximity to each other
