the purpose of any engine bell is to direct the exhaust of a rocket engine in one direction , generating thrust in the opposite direction if the exhaust is allowed to escape in this form , only a small part of the flow will be moving in the correct direction and thus contribute to forward thrust , outward from the main exhaust plume ) , the efficiency of the engine is reduced as the rocket travels because this escaping exhaust is no longer contributing to the thrust of the engine instead of firing the exhaust out of a small hole in the middle of a bell , an aerospike engine avoids this random distribution by firing along the outside edge of a wedge-shaped protrusion , the '' spike '' , which serves the same function as a traditional engine bell since the pressure in front of the vehicle is ambient , this means that the exhaust at the base of the spike nearly balances out with the drag experienced by the vehicle as the vehicle climbs to higher altitudes , the air pressure holding the exhaust against the spike decreases , as does the drag in front of the vehicle the recirculation zone at the base of the spike maintains the pressure in that zone to a fraction of 1 bar , higher than the near-vacuum in front of the vehicle , thus giving extra thrust as altitude increases in theory this requires an infinitely long spike for best efficiency , but by blowing a small amount of gas out of the center of a shorter truncated spike ( like base bleed in an artillery shell ) , something similar can be achieved in the linear aerospike the spike consists of a tapered wedge-shaped plate , with exhaust exiting on either side at the '' thick '' end this design has the advantage of being stackable , allowing several smaller engines to be placed in a row to make one larger engine while augmenting steering performance with the use of individual engine throttle control later models of these engines were based on their highly reliable j-2 engine machinery and provided the same sort of thrust levels as the conventional engines they were based on ; 200,000 lbf ( 890 kn ) in the j-2t-200k , and 250,000 & nbsp ; lbf ( 1.1 mn ) in the j-2t-250k ( the t refers to the toroidal combustion chamber ) for example , a milestone was achieved when a joint academic/industry team from california state university , long beach ( csulb ) and garvey spacecraft corporation successfully conducted a flight test of a liquid-propellant powered aerospike engine in the mojave desert on september 20 , 2003 the engine has a bell-shaped nozzle that has been cut in half , then stretched to form a ring with the half-nozzle now forming the profile of a plug in march 2017 arca space corporation announced their intention to build a single-stage-to-orbit rocket ( ssto ) , named haas 2ca , using a linear aerospike engine
