the subset of the phase space of the dynamical system corresponding to the typical behavior is the attractor , also known as the attracting section or attractee attractors are limit sets , but not all limit sets are attractors : it is possible to have some points of a system converge to a limit set , but different points when perturbed slightly off the limit set may get knocked off and never return to the vicinity of the limit set some attractors are known to be chaotic ( see strange attractor ) , in which case the evolution of any two distinct points of the attractor result in exponentially chaos theory , which complicates prediction when even the smallest noise is present in the system that is , if a is a point in an n-dimensional phase space , representing the initial state of the system , then f ( 0 , a ) a and , for a positive value of t , f ( t , a ) is the result of the evolution of this state after t units of time for example , if the system describes the evolution of a free particle in one dimension then the phase space is the plane r 2 with coordinates ( x , v ) , where x is the position of the particle , v is its velocity , a & nbsp ; & nbsp ; ( x , v ) , and the evolution is given by : f ( t , ( x , v ) ) ( x+tv , v ) \ an attractor is a subset a of the phase space characterized by the following three conditions : a is forward invariant under f : if a is an element of a then so is f ( t , a ) , for all & nbsp ; t & nbsp ; > & nbsp ; 0 there exists a neighborhood of a , called the basin of attraction for a and denoted b ( a ) , which consists of all points b that '' enter a in the limit t & nbsp ; → & nbsp ; ∞ '' more formally , b ( a ) is the set of all points b in the phase space with the following property : : : for any open neighborhood n of a , there is a positive constant t such that f ( t , b ) ∈ n for all real t > t for example , some authors require that an attractor have positive measure ( preventing a point from being an attractor ) , others relax the requirement that b ( a ) be a neighborhood if we regard the evolution of a dynamical system as a series of transformations , then there may or may not be a point which remains fixed under each transformation the final state that a dynamical system evolves towards corresponds to an attracting fixed point of the evolution function for that system , such as the center bottom position of a damped pendulum , the level and flat water line of sloshing water in a glass , or the bottom center of a bowl contain a rolling marble for example , if the bowl containing a rolling marble was inverted and the marble was balanced on top of the bowl , the center bottom ( now top ) of the bowl is a fixed state , but not an attractor in the case of a marble on top of an inverted bowl ( a hill ) , that point at the top of the bowl ( hill ) is a fixed point ( equilibrium ) , but not an attractor ( stable equilibrium ) in addition , physical dynamic systems with at least one fixed point invariably have multiple fixed points and attractors due to the reality of dynamics in the physical world , including the nonlinear dynamics of stiction , friction , surface roughness , deformation ( both elastic and plasticity ) , and even quantum mechanics in the case of a marble on top of an inverted bowl , even if the bowl seems perfectly hemispherical , and the marble 's sphere shape , are both much more complex surfaces when examined under a microscope , and their shapes change or deform during contact this is illustrated by the logistic map , which depending on its specific parameter value can have an attractor consisting of 1 point , 2 points , 2 n points , 3 points , 3×2 n points , 4 points , 5 points , or any given positive integer number of points ( the limit cycle of an ideal pendulum is not an example of a limit cycle attractor because its orbits are not isolated : in the phase space of the ideal pendulum , near any point of a periodic orbit there is another point that belongs to a different periodic orbit , so the former orbit is not attracting ) for example , in physics , one frequency may dictate the rate at which a planet orbits a star while a second frequency describes the oscillations in the distance between the two bodies if a strange attractor is chaotic , exhibiting sensitive dependence on initial conditions , then any two arbitrarily close alternative initial points on the attractor , after any of various numbers of iterations , will lead to points that are arbitrarily far apart ( subject to the confines of the attractor ) , and after any of various other numbers of iterations will lead to points that are arbitrarily close together an example is the well-studied logistic map , x_ in terms of square matrix a will have all elements of the dynamic vector diverge to infinity if the largest eigenvalue of a is greater than 1 in absolute value ; there is no attractor and no basin of attraction but if the largest eigenvalue is less than 1 in magnitude , all initial vectors will asymptotically converge to the zero vector , which is the attractor ; the entire n-dimensional space of potential initial vectors is the basin of attraction the scalar equation dx/dt ax causes all initial values of x except zero to diverge to infinity if a > 0 but to converge to an attractor at the value 0 if a dx/dt ax gives divergence from all initial points except the vector of zeroes if any eigenvalue of the matrix a is positive ; but if all the eigenvalues are negative the vector of zeroes is an attractor whose basin of attraction is the entire phase space self-excited attractors can be localized numerically by standard computational procedures , in which after a transient sequence , a trajectory starting from a point on an unstable manifold in a small neighborhood of an unstable equilibrium reaches an attractor , such as the classical attractors in the van der pol , belousov–zhabotinsky , lorenz , and many other dynamical systems
