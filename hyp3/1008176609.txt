on 9 march 1161 , tancred joined his uncle simon , prince of taranto , in invading the palace , detained the king and queen , william i and margaret , and their two sons , and incited a massacre of muslims originally , the older of these two sons , roger iv , duke of apulia , was destined to be crowned in place of william , but soon the populace supported the accession of simon himself tancred was exiled to constantinople and returned to sicily in 1166 upon the accession of the new king , his cousin william ii as william ii was heirless , tancred had a chance to claim the throne ; to prevent this , in october 1184 william released his aunt constance from monastery , approved her marriage and designated her as his heir in june 1185 , tancred led a huge sicilian fleet of 300 ships under the command of richard , count of acerra his brother-in-law to durazzo to attack the core of the byzantine empire the sicilian army was then heavily damaged by the army of the byzantine emperor isaac ii and was annihilated on the way back to the balkans , while the fleet of tancred returned to sicily unharmed in june 1186 , tancred and margaritus of brindisi led the norman fleet to cyprus ( the governor of cyprus , isaac comnenus , had rebelled against byzantine ) , captured 70 warships of isaac ii easily , expelled the byzantine generals who came there , causing the greatest naval loss of byzantine empire ; later margaritus was appointed as counts of zakynthos , cephalonia , and ithaki his coup was backed by the vice chancellor matthew d'ajello and the official class , while the rival claims of constance and her husband , henry vi , king of the romans , were supported by most of the nobles richard immediately demanded the release of his sister , william ii 's wife joan , imprisoned by tancred in 1189 , along with every penny of her dowry and dower ( in response of her vocal support of germans ) richard officially proclaimed his nephew arthur of brittany as his heir presumptive , and tancred promised to marry one of his daughters to arthur when he came of age ( arthur was four years old at the time ) sybilla suggested that constance be put to death after sensing that the citizens of palermo seemed to sympathize with her or view her as the legal heiress of sicily , but tancred did not agree , worrying that this would harm his popularity ; instead , he suggested sybilla to consult with matthew d'ajello , and after receiving a letter written by matthew d'ajello in presence of sybilla , he had constance locked in castel dell'ovo in naples to be better-guarded however , tancred was willing to give up his negotiation advantage , that is , his aunt , in exchange for pope celestine iii legitimizing him as king of sicily in turn , the pope was hoping that by securing constance 's safe passage back to rome , henry would be better disposed towards the papacy , and he was still hoping to keep the empire and the kingdom from uniting but his death at palermo ( 20 february 1194 ) two months after that of his young son and co-king , roger iii , opened the way for hohenstaufen rule in sicily his widow , sibylla of acerra , established a regency for their son , william iii , but henry returned to italy later that year , with his army financed by the lucrative ransom of richard i tancred 's children with sibylla were : roger iii , duke of apulia and king of sicily william iii , duke of apulia and king of sicily elvira , countess of lecce after the death of her brother ; married firstly walter iii of brienne , caffaro , genoa and the twelfth-century crusades , transl
