strabo and diodorus siculus write that the city was situated close to the sea and lay between the crathis and sybaris rivers ( from which the city derives its name ) today the coscile feeds into the crati about five kilometers from its mouth , which then passes just south of the archaeological site of the city when sybaris was still populated the coscile pursued a direct course into the gulf of taranto , probably at a short distance to the north strabo mentions it was an achaean colony and that its oekist ( founder ) was is of helike , a city in achaea diodorus siculus describes how sybaris had amassed great wealth and a huge population as a result of its fertile farming land and its policy of admitting aliens to its citizenry diodorus siculus writes that the oligarchy government of the city was overthrown in 510/09 & nbsp ; bc by a popular leader named telys ( herodotus describes him as a tyrant graham thinks it was plausible that the number of refugees was large enough for some kind of synoecism to have occurred between the poseidonians and the sybarites , possibly in the form of a sympolity sybaris was not completely destroyed , as diodorus and strabo claimed , but became a dependent '' ally '' of kroton however , according to timaeus and two scholia polyzelos was successful in relieving the siege of sybaris and fled to acragas later when he was accused of plotting revolution regardless of the results of the siege of 476 & nbsp ; bc , it seems the sybarites had to leave their city at some point between that year and 452/1 & nbsp ; bc diodorus writes that the sybarites refounded their city at its former site in 452/1 & nbsp ; bc under the leadership of a thessalian it is thought that poseidonia had a major share in this because the coins of the new city have a great resemblance to those of poseidonia possibly a treaty of friendship between sybaris , its allies and the serdaioi ( an unknown people ) dates to this new foundation , because poseidonia was the guarantor of this treaty ultimately the sybarites were again driven off by the krotoniates from their new city in 446/5 & nbsp ; bc with the help of athens and some other cities in the peloponnese they founded the city of thurii not far from the site of sybaris soon a conflict arose between the sybarites and the other colonists of thurii over the privileges the sybarites enjoyed some of the sybarites managed to flee and founded sybaris on the traeis shortly after 444 & nbsp ; bc the request for help from the sybarites must have been made after the conclusion of the thirty years ' peace in the early spring of 445 & nbsp ; bc , for it would not have made sense to ask for help while sparta and athens were still at war with each other while diodorus identifies only one expedition for the foundation of thurii , strabo writes that the athenian and other greek colonists first lived in sybaris and only founded thurii after the expulsion of the sybarites in the summer of 445 & nbsp ; bc the collision between the two groups led to the downfall of the sybarites in 444/3 & nbsp ; bc the athenians and other new colonists then turned the city into a new foundation called thurii aelianus , strabo and especially athenaeus saw the destruction of sybaris as divine vengeance upon the sybarites for their pride , arrogance , and excessive luxury a fragment of the comedian metagenes he quotes has a sybarite boasting about literal rivers of food flowing through the city metagenes , testimonia and fragments not only does athenaeus provide a great deal of examples to show the decadence of sybarites , he also argues that their excessive luxury and sins led to their doom the most direct link between luxury and corruption is evident in atheneaus ' anecdote about the defeat of the sybarites : to amuse themselves the sybarite cavalrymen trained their horses to dance to flute music this association of sybaris with excessive luxury transferred to the english language , in which the words '' sybarite '' and '' sybaritic '' have become bywords for opulent luxury and outrageous pleasure seeking
