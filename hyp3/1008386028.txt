he stayed six months , and the close-knit group , who included georgette leblanc , former companion of maurice maeterlinck , were to become influential in antheil 's career as her financial support enabled antheil to maintain a degree of independence in his work , many observers believed he should have given her more credit in his autobiography for the length and extent of her contribution to his career he considered himself an expert on female endocrinology , and wrote a series of articles about how to determine the availability of women based on glandular effects on their appearance , with titles such as '' the glandbook for the questing male '' the young do n't cry ( 1957 ) the pride and the passion ( 1957 ) air power ( 1956 ) tv series ( unknown episodes ) dementia ( 1955 ) not as a stranger ( 1955 ) hunters of the deep ( 1954 ) the juggler ( 1953 ) target hong kong ( 1953 ) actor 's and sin ( 1952 ) ( uncredited ) the sniper ( 1952 ) sirocco ( 1951 ) in a lonely place ( 1950 ) house by the river ( 1950 ) tokyo joe ( 1949 ) the fighting kentuckian ( 1949 ) we were strangers ( 1949 ) knock on any door ( 1949 ) along the oregon trail ( 1947 ) repeat performance ( 1947 ) that brennan girl ( 1946 ) ( score music ) plainsman and the lady ( 1946 ) specter of the rose ( 1946 ) angels over broadway ( 1940 ) adventure in diamonds ( 1940 ) the buccaneer ( 1938 ) make way for tomorrow ( 1937 ) the plainsman ( 1936 ) once in a blue moon ( 1935 ) the scoundrel ( 1935 ) he re-entered american life with enthusiasm , organizing concerts , working on committees with aaron copland and wallingford riegger , and writing piano , ballet , and film scores , as well as an opera helen retires about helen of troy ;
