repentance typically requires an admission of guilt for committing a wrong or for omitting to do the right thing ; a promise or resolve not to repeat the offense ; an attempt to make restitution for the wrong , or in some way to reverse the harmful effects of the wrong or the omission where possible it divides repentance into two parts : '' one is contrition , that is , terrors smiting the conscience through the knowledge of sin ; '' '' the other is faith , which is born of the gospel , or of absolution , and believes that for christ 's sake , sins are forgiven , comforts the conscience , and delivers it from terrors the greek word used for repentance in the new testament is μετάνοια ( metanoia ) , and the greek verb for '' to repent '' is μετανοῶ , contracted from μετανο-έω ( metano-eo ) , as in mark 's account of the initial preaching of jesus : '' the time is fulfilled , and the kingdom of god has come near ; repent , and trust in the good news '' in english , the prefix meta can indicate '' beyond , about '' , as '' meta-economics '' or '' meta-philosophy '' ( see meta ) , inspired by the non-greek use of the word '' metaphysics '' , which in greek was just the title of a work of aristotle , the metaphysics , so named simply because in the customary ordering of the works of aristotle it was the book following the physics ; the greek word thus meant nothing more than '' the book that comes after the book entitled physics '' the protestant reformer john calvin wrote that repentance '' may be justly defined to be a true conversion of our life to god , proceeding from a serious fear of god , and consisting in the mortification of the flesh and of the old man , and in the vivification of the spirit ( talmud yoma 86b ; mishneh torah teshuva 2:1-2 ) '' he that confesses his sin and still clings to it is likened to a man that holds in his hand a defiling object ; though he batheth in all the waters of the world he is not cleansed ; but the moment he casteth the defiling object from him a single bath will cleanse him , as it is said : 'whosoever confesses and forsakes them his sins shall have mercy ' & nbsp ; '' in mahayana buddhism , one of the most common repentance verses used for reflection is samantabhadra 's repentance verse taken from chapter 40 of the flower adornment sutra : for all the evil deeds i have done in the past created by my body , mouth , and mind , from beginningless greed , anger , and delusion , i now know shame and repent of them all in the new testament , the word translated as 'repentance ' is the greek word μετάνοια ( metanoia ) , '' after/behind one 's mind '' , which is a compound word of the preposition 'meta ' ( after , with ) , and the verb 'noeo ' ( to perceive , to think , the result of perceiving or observing ) in the first place , when we call repentance ' a conversion of the life to god ' , we require a transformation , not only in the external actions , but in the soul itself ; which , after having put off the old nature , should produce the fruits of actions corresponding to its renovation 118-119 it is a change of mind that involves a conscious turning away from wrong actions , attitudes and thoughts that conflict with a godly lifestyle and biblical commands , and an intentional turning toward doing that which the bible says pleases god in the first case , the manifestation of repentance consists in : ( 1 ) confession of one 's sin before god , the essential part being a solemn promise and firm resolve not to commit the same sin again ( mishna yoma chapter 8 , 8 ) yom kippur , the day of atonement , derives its significance only from the fact that it is the culmination of the ten penitential days with which the jewish religious year begins ; and therefore it is of no avail without repentance midrash sifra , emor , 14 jewish doctrine holds that it is never too late , even on the day of death , to return to god with sincere repentance for '' as the sea is always open for every one who wishes to cleanse himself , so are the gates of repentance always open to the sinner '' '' at-tahriim 66:8 although repentance is considered as one act that can be used for cleansing the sins , the quran notes that all of the sins are forgiven with or without repentance except the state of shirk , i.e '' rend your heart , and not your garments , and turn unto the lord your god : for he is gracious and full of compassion , slow to anger and plenteous in mercy , and repenteth him of the evil '' even in a non-religious context , the greek word μετάνοια ( metanoia ) , in particular , meant '' change of mind or heart , repentance '' or , in rhetoric , '' afterthought , correction '' the doctrine of repentance as taught in the bible is a call to persons to make a radical turn from one way of life to another many rabbinic sources state that repentance is of paramount importance to the existence of this world , so that it was one of the seven provisions which god made before the creation in his pentecost sermon , peter the apostle called on people to repent , an appeal he repeated in his sermon at the beautiful gate of the temple : '' repent therefore , and return again to god , that your sins may be blotted out '' metanoia is therefore primarily an after-thought , different from the former thought ; a change of mind and change of conduct , '' change of mind and heart '' , or , '' change of consciousness '' if the wronged man has died , restitution must be made to his heir ; if he has no heir , it must be given to the priest who officiates at the sacrifice made for the remission of the sin talmud bavli , tractates pesahim 54a ; nedarim 39b ; midrash genesis rabbah 1 '' the holy one , blessed be his name , said to elijah , 'behold , the precious gift which i have bestowed on my world : though a man sins again and again , but returns in penitence , i will receive him
