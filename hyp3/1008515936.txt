the fact that they were found primarily in areas of germanic europe , where , prior to christianisation , germanic paganism was followed in various forms , has led to speculation by some that the maypoles were in some way a relic of a germanic pagan tradition one theory holds that they were a remnant of the germanic reverence for sacred trees , as there is evidence for various sacred trees and wooden pillars that were venerated by the pagans across much of germanic europe , including thor 's oak and the irminsul and now , disengag 'd from the shirt , i saw , with wonder and surprise , what ? not the play-thing of a boy , not the weapon of a man , but a maypole of so enormous a standard , that had proportions been observ 'd , it must have belong 'd to a young giant grand master marc'antonio zondadari introduced the game of cockaigne ( with the use of the maypole ) to maltese carnival in 1721 : on a given signal , the crowd assembled in palace square converged on a collection of hams , sausages and live animals hidden beneath leafy branches outside the main guard image : weingarten ( baden ) maibaum.jpg thumb right maypole in weingarten ( baden ) image : fachwerkhaus_mit_maibaum , _k % c3 % b6nigswinter.jpg thumb left rhenish maypole for a girl in königswinter in germany and austria the maypole ( or maibaum ) is a tradition going back to the 16th century it is a decorated tree or tree trunk that is usually erected either on 1 may – in baden and swabia – or on the evening before , for example , in east frisia the custom of combining it with a village or town fete , that usually takes place on 30 april , 1 & nbsp ; may or at pentecost ( whitsun ) , is widespread this tradition is especially strong in the villages of the bavarian alps where the raising of the traditional maypole on 1 may in the village square is a cause for much celebration if a village manages to steal a maibaum , then the village the maibaum has been stolen from has to invite the whole village of the thieves to free beer and a festivity which then takes place on may 1 just before the maibaum is erected , depending on the region , there may be a procession through the village , usually ending up at a central place and/or restaurant and usually watched by crowds of spectators and accompanied by a brass band in denmark the maypole tradition is almost extinct but is still observed on the islands of avernakø and strynø south of funen and in a few villages in southern himmerland in eastern jutland in sweden and swedish speaking parts of finland , the maypole is usually called a midsummer pole , , as it appears at the midsummer celebrations , although the literal translation majstång also occurs , where the word maj refers to the old swedish word maja which means dress and not to the month of may a perhaps more original incarnation is the one still in use in the swedish landscape of småland where the pole carries a large horizontally suspended ring around it , hanging from ropes attached at the top of the pole common in all of sweden are traditional ring dances , mostly in the form of dances where you are alternating dancing and making movements and gestures based on the songs , such as pretending that you are scrubbing laundry while singing about washing , or jumping as frogs during the song små grodorna ( '' the little frogs '' ) '' the practice had become increasingly popular throughout the ensuing centuries , with the maypoles becoming '' communal symbols '' that brought the local community together - in some cases , poorer parishes would join up with neighbouring ones in order to obtain and erect one , whilst in other cases , such as in hertfordshire in 1602 and warwickshire in 1639 , people stole the poles of neighbouring communities , leading to violence under the reign of edward vi in england and wales , the protestant anglicanism was declared to be the state religion , and under the reformation many maypoles , such as the famous cornhill maypole of london , were destroyed ; however when mary i ascended the throne after edward 's death , she reinstated roman catholicism as the state faith , and the practice of maypoles was reinstated under later english monarchs , the practice was sporadic , being banned in certain areas , such as doncaster , canterbury and bristol , but continuing in many others , according to the wishes of the local governors in scotland meanwhile , which at this time was still an independent state , protestantism , in the form of presbyterianism , had taken a more powerful hold , and largely wiped out the practice of maypoles across the country the maypole there was the tallest by far , reaching over a hundred and thirty feet , and it stood until being blown over by a high wind in 1672 , when it was moved to wansted in essex and served as a mount for the telescope of isaac newton as revived , the dance is performed by pairs of boys and girls ( or men and women ) who stand alternately around the base of the pole , each holding the end of a ribbon for dressing a maypole , one of the last recorded examples of the rural festival of the first of may in scotland , having been put down by act of parliament immediately after the reformation in 1560 while not celebrated among the general public in the united states today , a maypole dance nearly identical to that celebrated in the united kingdom is an important part of may day celebrations in local schools and communities the earliest use of the maypole in america occurred in 1628 , where william bradford , governor of new plymouth , wrote of an incident where a number of servants , together with the aid of an agent , broke free from their indentured servant to create their own colony , setting up a maypole in the center of the settlement , and behaving in such a way as to receive the scorn and disapproval of the nearby colonies , as well as an officer of the king , bearing patent for the state of massachusetts bradford writes : they also set up a may-pole , drinking and dancing about it many days togaether , inviting the indean women , for their consorts , dancing and frisking togither , ( like so many fairy , or furies rather , ) and worse practises john endecott , who brought a patent under the broad seall , for the governmente of the massachusetts , who visiting those parts caused the may-polle to be cutt downe , and rebuked them for their profannes , and admonished them to looke ther should be better walking ; so they now , or others , changed the name of their place againe , and called it mounte-dagon in the second half of the 20th century the rite of the maypole around ascoli remained a rite of celebration of spring but it became also a political symbol of the peasant movement ( metayage ) that struggled against the landowners to have decent living conditions every year , even today , on the night of 30 april , in many villages of the zone like appignano del tronto , arquata del tronto , ascoli piceno , castorano , castignano , castel di lama , colli del tronto , grottammare , monsampolo del tronto , porchia ( montalto marche ) , monteprandone , offida , rotella , spinetoli , san benedetto del tronto , citizens cut a poplar on which they put-up a red flag and the tree is erected in village squares or at crossroads in the netflix series chilling adventures of sabrina , a maypole is used in the festival of lupercalia in the videogame valheim found as an easter egg ( media )
