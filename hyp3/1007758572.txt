a system of patronage ( clientela ) , a senate ( attributed by dionysius to greek influence ) and a personal bodyguard of 300 of the strongest and fittest among the nobles were also established : the latter , the celeres , were so-named either for their quickness , or , according to valerius antias , for their commander 101 and 116 dionysius is thus one of the primary sources for the accounts of the roman foundation myth , and that of romulus and remus , and was relied on in the later publications of plutarch , for example 239 his first two books present a unified account of the supposed greek origin for rome , merging a variety of sources into a firm narrative : his success , however , was at the expense of concealing the primitive roman actuality ( as revealed by archaeology ) 164 in his narrative , however , the cities of caecina , crustumerium , and antemnae petition for tatius , king of the sabines to lead them to war ;
