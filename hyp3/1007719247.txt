clients do not talk directly to one another as it is decentralized - anyone can run a server according to the xmpp website , some of the most popular software include gajim ( windows , linux ) , swift.im ( macos , windows , linux ) , conversations ( android ) , monal ( macos , ios ) and converse.js ( web browser ) xmpp has often been regarded as a competitor to simple , based on session initiation protocol ( sip ) , as the standard protocol for instant messaging and presence notification xmpp is also used in deployments of non-im services , including smart grid systems such as demand response applications , message-oriented middleware , and as a replacement for sms to provide text messaging on many smartphone clients any user can '' register '' with one of these gateways by providing the information needed to log on to that network , and can then communicate with users of that network as though they were xmpp users as a result , any client that fully supports xmpp can access any network with a gateway without extra code in the client , and without the need for the client to have direct access to the internet one example is google , which in august 2005 introduced google talk , a combination voip and im system that uses xmpp for instant messaging and as a base for a voice and file transfer signaling protocol called jingle xmpp applications beyond im include : chat rooms , network management , content syndication , collaboration tools , file sharing , gaming , remote systems control and monitoring , geolocation , middleware and cloud computing , voip , and identity services the xmpp standards foundation ( xsf ) develops and publishes extensions to xmpp through a standards process centered on xmpp extension protocols ( xeps , previously known as jabber enhancement proposals - jeps ) in addition to these core protocols standardized at the ietf , the xmpp standards foundation ( formerly the jabber software foundation ) is active in developing open xmpp extensions along with authentication and in-transit data protection , xmpp can be applied at a variety of levels and may prove ideal as an extensible middleware or message-oriented middleware ( mom ) protocol the means to route messages based on a logical endpoint identifier - the jid , instead of by an explicit ip address present opportunities to use xmpp as an overlay network implementation on top of different underlay networks one of the original design goals of the early jabber open-source community was enabling users to connect to multiple instant messaging systems ( especially non-xmpp systems ) through a single client application some of the largest messaging providers use , or have been using , various forms of xmpp based protocols in their backend systems without necessarily exposing this fact to their end users
