due in large part to loss of life throughout the years of military campaigns , high death rates among fanompoana workers , and harsh traditions of justice under her rule , the population of madagascar is estimated to have declined from around 5 million to 2.5 million between 1833 and 1839 , and the population of imerina from 750,000 to 130,000 between 1829 and 1842 430 the progressive brothers rainivoninahitriniony and rainilaiarivony , who were the queen 's co-prime minister and head of the army respectively at the time of her death , supported the succession of radama and were able to exercise greater influence than ramboasalama , particularly in ensuring the support of the army for the prince 's claim to the throne early in her reign , the queen took incremental steps to distance madagascar from the purview of european powers , first putting an end to a friendship treaty with britain , then placing increasing restrictions on the activities of the missionaries of the london missionary society , who operated schools where basic education and trade skills were taught in addition to the christian religion 14 following andriamihaja 's death , the influence of radama 's old guard of progressives was eclipsed by that of conservative advisers at court , who grew ever closer to the queen , eventually resulting in ranavalona 's marriage to sampy guardian and conservative figurehead field marshal rainiharo ( also called ravoninahitriniarivo ) of ilafy in 1833 as ranavalona lay on her death bed , radama took precautions to ensure his succession would be uncontested , surrounding his residence at the rova of antananarivo with several hundred soldiers and sending a member of ramboasalama 's family to bring him to the rova to swear a public oath of allegiance to the new king , to whom he submitted ramavo took the throne name ranavalona ( '' folded '' , '' kept aside '' ) , then followed royal custom by systematically capturing and putting to death her political rivals , including rakotobe , his family , and other members of radama 's family , much as radama had done to the queen 's own family upon his succession to the throne although female rulers had once been common among the vazimba , described in oral histories as the original inhabitants of madagascar , this tradition ended in the central highlands with the reign of andriamanelo ( 1540–1575 ) , founder of the kingdom of imerina and successor to his vazimba mother , queen rafohy ( 1530–1540 ) she strengthened her relationship with the public through occasional kabary and fulfilled the traditional role of the merina sovereign as bestower of hasina ( ancestral blessings ) by enacting traditional rituals , including the fandroana ( new year ritual of renewal ) , tributes to the royal idols , and offerings of vodiondry and jaka beef at customary occasions 570 according to 19th-century malagasy historian raombana , in the eyes of the greater populace , the tangena ordeal was believed to represent a sort of celestial justice in which the public placed their unquestioning faith , even to the point of accepting a verdict of guilt in a case of innocence as a just but unknowable divine mystery the french were eager to hasten radama ii 's succession in the interest of capitalizing on the lambert charter , an 1855 agreement between french representative joseph-françois lambert and radama that could only come into effect upon the prince 's succession while the queen had designated her son , radama ii , as her successor , rainimaharo and the conservative faction knew of his progressive leanings and tried instead to ensure the queen 's nephew , ramboasalama , would come to power and maintain loyalties to them and their political agenda according to a british account , lambert conspired with jean laborde and local leaders to persuade radama ii to sign a document written in french—a language in which the prince was not fluent—which lambert orally translated as containing only an account of the excessive pressures the queen 's policies were placing on her subjects following a visit by radama i to madagascar 's first formal school , established in toamasina in 1818 by members of the london missionary society ( lms ) , the king invited the first christian artisan missionaries to the capital city to share their knowledge 11 the queen 's foreign contemporaries strongly condemned her policies and viewed them as the actions of a tyrant or even a madwoman , a characterization that persisted in western historical literature until the 1970s if nobles or freemen were compelled to undergo the ordeal , the poison was typically administered to the accused only after dog and rooster stand-ins had already died from the poison 's effects , while among members of the slave class ( andevo ) , the ordeal required them to immediately ingest the poison themselves ranavalona continued the wars of expansion conducted by her predecessor , radama i , in an effort to extend her realm over the entire island , and imposed strict punishments on those who were judged as having acted in opposition to her will the freedom allowed to lms and malagasy christians to print religious materials and teach religion in the state schools during the first six years of ranavalona 's reign allowed the religion to become firmly established among a small but growing group of converts in and around the capital 222 the conversion of major religious , political and social leaders sparked a backlash that led ranavalona to become increasingly wary of the political and cultural effects of christianity , which she saw as leading the malagasy to forsake the ancestors and their traditions in her discourse , she was careful to differentiate between her own people , for whom the new religion was forbidden and its practice a capital offense , and foreigners , to whom she permitted freedom of religion and conscience according to pfeiffer , radama and lambert had planned to dethrone the queen on june 20 , when ministers and soldiers loyal to radama would infiltrate the rova grounds and declare loyalty to the prince and support for a political transition & nbsp ; 80–85 according to lambert , however , the prince had indeed been an enthusiastic partner in the bid to end ranavalona 's reign , and his own true feelings about the endeavor had been misrepresented by the british diplomats 375 when ramavo was still a young girl , her father alerted king andrianampoinimerina ( 1787–1810 ) to an assassination plot planned by andrianjafy , the king 's uncle , whom andrianampoinimerina had forced from the throne at the royal city of ambohimanga during her funeral , a spark accidentally ignited a nearby barrel of gunpowder destined for use in the ceremony , causing an explosion and fire that killed a number of bystanders and destroyed three historic royal residences in the nanjakana section of the compound where the event was held ranavalona 's 33-year reign was characterized by her effort to strengthen the domestic authority of the kingdom of imerina over subjugated provinces and preserve the political and cultural sovereignty of madagascar & nbsp ; 45–47 in the early years of ranavalona 's reign , andriamihaja was the leader of her court 's progressive faction , who favored maintaining the relations with europe initiated under radama 199 james cameron and other key missionaries preferred to leave rather than remain on the island without authorization to proselytize ; most of the london missionary society missionaries , whose primary activity was teaching christian theology and literacy at their newly established schools using the bible as the principal malagasy-language text , departed the island major-general andriamihaja most likely fathered the queen 's only son , prince rakoto ( later king radama ii ) , who was born eleven months after the death of his official father , king radama i & nbsp ; 225–277 according to a british account , however , radama himself was credited with warning the queen of the plot , in which his cooperation was merely a ploy to entrap the conspirators 48 shortly after taking the throne , ranavalona annulled the anglo-merina treaty that had been concluded between radama and british envoys , and refused to continue receiving annual payments from britain in exchange for adherence to the stipulations of the treaty & nbsp ; 185–186 pursuant to the february 26 decree , those who possessed a bible , worshiped in congregation or continued to profess adherence to christianity were fined , jailed , manacled , subjected to trial by ordeal , or executed however , they hesitated to report the news of radama 's death for several days , fearing possible reprisals against them for having been involved in denouncing one of the king 's rivals , whose family had a stake in the succession after radama the residence was made entirely from wood and bore most of the features of a traditional home of the merina andriana ( aristocratic class ) , including a central pillar ( andry ) to support the roof in october and november 1831 the queen enacted a ban on christian marriages , baptisms , and church services for soldiers and members of government studying in the missionary schools , ellis ( 1870 ) , p putting an end to most foreign trade relationships , the queen pursued a policy of self-reliance , made possible through frequent use of the long-standing tradition of corvée—forced labor in lieu of tax payments in money or goods although ranavalona has traditionally been depicted as a cruel and xenophobic tyrant , in more recent historical analyses she is commonly viewed as an astute politician who effectively protected the political and cultural sovereignty of her nation from european encroachment after the plot 's discovery , the europeans were largely confined to their houses on the palace grounds and prohibited from receiving visitors , until an order was issued to immediately and permanently quit the queen 's territory in late july in the meantime , radama , who had been made to swear on the bible not to speak of the letter to anyone , had grown concerned enough to contact a british diplomat , thereby revealing the true circumstances under which the letter had been signed upon rainiharo 's death , the queen wed another conservative , field marshal andrianisa ( also called rainijohary ) , who remained ranavalona 's husband until her death in 1861 fanompoana labor among the population of imerina could include conscription into the military , enabling the queen to raise a standing army that was estimated at 20,000 to 30,000 soldiers in 1897 , french colonial authorities disinterred and moved the queen 's body and the remains of other merina sovereigns to the tombs at the rova of antananarivo in an attempt to desanctify ambohimanga women , however , were associated with the household , a rigid kinship unit in opposition to the innovating role and power of the sovereign , and so were not viewed as suited to rule the majority , regardless of their feelings toward her domestic policies , consider her a remarkable figure in malagasy history and commend her strength as a ruler in a period of tension with european powers
