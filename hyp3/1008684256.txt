torrential rains had flooded the rivers and turned the roads into mud pits houston learned of battle of coleto on march 20 and realized his army was the last hope for an independent texas concerned that his ill-trained and ill-disciplined force would be good for only one battle , and aware that his men could easily be outflanked by urrea 's forces , houston continued to avoid engagement , to the immense displeasure of his troops for the next two weeks , the texians rested , recovered from illness , and , for the first time , began practicing military drills carson advised houston to continue retreating all the way to the sabine river , where more volunteers would likely flock from the united states and allow the army to counterattack fear that urrea 's victories would position him as a political rival convinced santa anna to remain in texas to personally oversee the final phase of the campaign at dawn on april 7 , their combined force marched into san felipe and captured a texian soldier , who informed santa anna that the texians planned to retreat further if the mexican army crossed the brazos river unable to cross the brazos because of the small company of texians barricaded at the river crossing , on april 14 a frustrated santa anna led a force of about 700 troops to capture the interim texas government government officials fled mere hours before mexican troops arrived in harrisburgh ( now harrisburg , houston ) and santa anna sent almonte with 50 cavalry to intercept them in new washington almonte 's scouts incorrectly reported that houston 's army was going to lynchburg crossing on buffalo bayou , in preparation for joining the government in galveston , so santa anna ordered harrisburgh burned and pressed on towards lynchburg they arrived on april 18 , not long after the mexican army 's departure that same day , deaf smith and henry karnes captured a mexican courier carrying intelligence on the locations and future plans of all of the mexican troops in texas realizing that santa anna had only a small force and was not far away , houston gave a rousing speech to his men , exhorting them to '' remember the alamo '' and '' remember goliad '' out of concern that his men might not differentiate between mexican soldiers and the tejanos in seguín 's company , houston originally ordered seguín and his men to remain in harrisburgh to guard those who were too ill to travel quickly after loud protests from seguín and antonio menchaca , the order was rescinded , provided the tejanos wear playing cards in their hats to identify them as texian soldiers over the protests of several of his officers , santa anna chose to make camp in a vulnerable location , a plain near the san jacinto river , bordered by woods on one side , marsh and lake on another in the melee , rusk , on foot to reload his rifle , was almost captured by mexican soldiers but was rescued by newly arrived texian volunteer mirabeau b houston was irate that the infantry had disobeyed his orders and given santa anna a better estimate of their strength ;

'' , to engage in hand-to-hand combat the texian infantry forces advanced without halt until they had possession of the woodland and the mexican breastwork ; the right wing of burleson 's and the left wing of millard 's forces took possession of the breastwork many texian officers , including houston and rusk , attempted to stop the slaughter , but they were unable to gain control of the men , incensed and vengeful for the massacres at the alamo and goliad , while frightened mexican infantry yelled '' me no alamo ! '' and begged for mercy to no avail although santa anna 's troops had been thoroughly vanquished , they did not represent the bulk of the mexican army in texas texians had won the battle because of mistakes made by santa anna , and houston was well aware that his troops would have little hope of repeating their victory against urrea or filisola finding the bridge destroyed , he hid in the marsh and was captured the following day , wearing the uniform jacket of a private in a letter to filisola , who was now the senior mexican official in texas , santa anna wrote that '' yesterday evening we had an unfortunate encounter '' and ordered his troops to retreat to béxar and await further instructions filisola later wrote that '' had the enemy met us under these cruel circumstances , on the only road that was left , no alternative remained but to die or surrender at discretion '' for several weeks after san jacinto , santa anna continued to negotiate with houston , rusk , and then burnet santa anna suggested two treaties , a public version of promises made between the two countries , and a private version that included santa anna 's personal agreements he secretly promised to persuade the mexican congress to acknowledge the republic of texas and to recognize the rio grande as the border between the two countries the area around san patricio and refugio suffered a '' noticeable depopulation '' in the republic of texas years when mexican authorities received word of santa anna 's defeat at san jacinto , flags across the country were lowered to half staff and draped in mourning denouncing any agreements signed by a prisoner , mexican authorities refused to recognize the republic of texas such a large number of american volunteers flocked to the texian army in the months after the victory at san jacinto that the texian government was unable to maintain an accurate list of enlistments for years , mexican authorities used the reconquering of texas as an excuse for implementing new taxes and making the army the budgetary priority of the impoverished nation the northern mexican states , the focus of the matamoros expedition , briefly launched an independent republic of the rio grande in 1839 on june 1 , 1836 , santa anna boarded a ship to travel back to mexico for the next two days , crowds of soldiers , many of whom had arrived that week from the united states , gathered to demand his execution voters overwhelmingly chose houston the first president , ratified the constitution drawn up by the convention of 1836 , and approved a resolution to request annexation to the united states authorized april 21 , 1936 , and dedicated april 21 , 1939 , the monument cost 1.5 & nbsp ; million ( equivalent to million in both the texas navy and the united states navy have commissioned ships named after the battle of san jacinto : the and three ships named when the veteran battleship was decommissioned in 1948 and made into a museum ship , it was decided to give her a permanent anchorage near the san jacinto monument her arrival from baltimore , where she was decommissioned , was timed for april 21 , 1948 – the 112th anniversary of the battle of san jacinto battle of san jacinto – handbook of texas online flags of guerrero and matamoros battalions – texas state library and archives commission san jacinto monument & museum
