the status of marriage , as opposed to unmarried pregnant women , allows the spouse to be responsible for the child , and to speak on behalf of their wife ; a partner is also responsible for the wife 's child in states where they are automatically assumed to be the biological legal parent , by roman catholic ritual , the word bride actually means fiancée and applies up to the exchange of matrimonial consent ( the actual marriage act ) ; from then on , even while the rest of the very ceremony is ongoing , the woman is a wife , and no longer a bride , and the bridal couple is no longer referred to as such but as the newlywed couple the term wife is most commonly applied to a woman in a union sanctioned by law ( including religious law ) , not to a woman in an informal cohabitation relationship , which may be known as a girlfriend , partner , cohabitant , significant other , concubine , mistress etc in some cultures , it was paid not only to support the establishment of a new family , but also served as a condition that if the husband committed grave offenses upon his wife , the dowry had to be returned to the wife or her family ; but during the marriage , the dowry was often made inalienable by the husband traditionally , and still in many cultures , the role of a wife was closely tied to that of a mother , by a strong expectation that a wife ought to bear children , while , conversely , an unmarried woman should not have a child out of wedlock a married woman is commonly given the honorific title '' mrs '' , but some married women prefer to be referred to as '' ms '' , a title which is also used by preference or when the marital status of a woman is unknown in the 20th century , the role of the wife in western marriage changed in two major ways ; the first was the breakthrough from an '' institution to companionate marriage '' ; '' companionship marriage '' and '' companionate marriage '' are synonyms ( the latter being the older one ) , although the term usually refers to a relationship based on equality , it might instead refer to a marriage with mutual interest in their children , for the first time since the middle ages , wives became distinct legal entities , and were allowed their own property and allowed to sue in some societies , especially historically , a concubine was a woman who was in an ongoing , usually matrimonially oriented relationship with a man who could not be married to her , often because of a difference in social status in some cultures , the termination of the status of wife made life itself meaningless , as in the case of those cultures that practiced sati , a funeral ritual within some asian communities , in which a recently widowed woman self-immolation , typically on the husband 's funeral pyre in particular , the control of marital property , inheritance rights , and the right to dictate the activities of children of the marriage , have typically been given to male marital partners the new testament condemns divorce for both men and women ( 1 cor 7:10–11 ) , and assumes monogamy on the part of the husband : the wife is to have her '' own '' husband , and the husband is to have his '' own '' wife ( 1 cor 7:2 ) traditionally , and still in some parts of the world , the bride or her family bring her husband a dowry , or the husband or his family pay a bride price to the bride 's family , or both are exchanged between the families ; or the husband pays the wife a dower spain , in 1981 , spain abolished the requirement that married women must have their husbands ’ permission to initiate judicial proceedings and france although married women in france obtained the right to work without their husbands ' permission in 1965 , and the paternal authority of a man over his family was ended in 1970 ( before that parental responsibilities belonged to the father who made all legal decisions concerning the children ) , it was only in 1985 that a legal reform abolished the stipulation that the husband had the sole power to administer the children 's property the second change was the drastic alteration of middle and upper-class family life , when in the 1960s these wives began to work outside their home , and with the social acceptance of divorces the single-parent family , and stepfamily or '' blended family '' as a more '' individualized marriage '' in various marriage laws around the world , however , the husband continues to have authority ; for instance the civil code of iran states at article 1105 : '' in relations between husband and wife ; the position of the head of the family is the exclusive right of the husband '' in the 18th and 19th centuries , which contained much criticism of these facts , see also mary wollstonecraft , a vindication of the rights of women , boston 1792 the situation was assessed by the english conservative moralist sir william blackstone : '' the husband and wife are one , and the husband is the one as a result , divorce was relatively uncommon in the pre-modern west , particularly in the medieval and early modern period , and husbands in the roman , later medieval and early modern period did not publicly take more than one wife cuckoo 's egg in the nest , spiegel 07 , 2007 vice versa , a wife has more legal authority in some cases when she speaks on behalf of a spouse than she would have if they were not married , e.g if she is marrying a man , her partner is known as the groom during the wedding , and within the marriage is called her husband a woman on her wedding day is usually described as a bride , even after the wedding ceremony , while being described as a wife is also appropriate after the wedding or after the honeymoon however , a woman in a so-called common law marriage may describe herself as a common law wife , de facto wife , or simply a wife the status of a wife may be terminated by divorce , annulment , or the death of a spouse '' wife '' refers to the institutionalized relation to the other spouse , unlike mother , a term that puts a woman into the context of her children silvia evangelisti , wives , widows , and brides of christ : marriage and the convent in the historiography of early modern italy , cambridge 2000 much more significant than the option of becoming a nun , was the option of non-religious spinsterhood in the west the holy new testament allows a christian widow to ( re ) marry a man she chooses ( 1 cor 7:39 ) but forbids a divorced christian woman to ( re ) marry a man because she would be committing adultery if she did ( matthew 5:32 ) , she is to remain unmarried and celibate or be reconciled with her husband ( 1 cor 7:1-2 & 8-9 and 1 cor 7:10-11 ) a married woman may indicate her marital status in a number of ways : in western culture a married woman would commonly wear a wedding ring but in other cultures other markers of marital status may be used some jurisdictions consider this practice as discriminatory and contrary to women 's rights , and have restricted or banned it ; for example , since 1983 , when greece adopted a new marriage law which guaranteed gender equality between the spouses , women in greece are required to keep their birth names for their whole life the social status of such women varies by culture , but in some places , they may be subject to potentially harmful practices , such as widow inheritance or levirate marriage ; or divorced women may be socially stigmatized adultery may be a factor to consider in a property settlement , it may affect the status of children , the custody of children ; moreover , adultery can result in social ostracism in some parts of the world 837–856 in western countries today , married women usually have an education , a profession and they ( or their husbands ) can take time off from their work in a legally procured system of ante-natal care , statutory maternity leave , and they may get maternity pay or a maternity allowance the original meaning of the phrase '' wife '' as simply '' woman '' , unconnected with marriage or a husband/wife , is preserved in words such as '' midwife '' , '' goodwife '' , '' fishwife '' and '' spaewife '' in late antiquity , most roman women seem to have married in their late teens to early twenties , but nobiles married younger than those of the lower classes , and an aristocratic maiden was expected to be virgin until her first marriage in addition , affinity rules of catholicism , of judaism and of islam prohibit an ex-wife or widow from engaging in sexual relations with and from marrying a number of relatives of the former husband however , this practice was curtailed to a great deal in many countries in the twentieth century , and more modern statutes tend to define the rights and duties of a spouse without reference to gender in japan , before enactment of the meiji civil code of 1898 , all of the woman 's property such as land or money passed to her husband except for personal clothing and a mirror stand there is a widely held expectation , which has existed for most of recorded history and in most cultures , that a wife is not to have sexual relations with anyone other than her legal husband with regard to annulment , such terms are not , strictly speaking , correct , because annulment , unlike divorce , is usually retroactive , meaning that an annulled marriage is considered to be invalid from the beginning almost as if it had never taken place christian cultures claim to be guided by the new testament in regard to their view on the position of a wife in society as well as her marriage when her spouse is in a coma after an accident , a wife may have the right of advocacy
