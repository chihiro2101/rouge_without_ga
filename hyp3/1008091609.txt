apelles ' paintings ( none of which survive ) included : alexander wielding a thunderbolt , one of the many he did of both alexander and his father philip ; venus anadyomene ( '' aphrodite rising from the sea '' ) , showing the goddess rising from the sea ( not the painting he was working on when he died , but an earlier painting ) , for which pliny the elder relates the tradition he used a former mistress of alexander , campaspe , as his model for aphrodite a number of his paintings were taken to rome ( including aphrodite anadyomene ) and placed there on public display ; in two compositions featuring portraits of alexander ( castor and pollux with victory and alexander the great , and the figure of war with his hands tied behind him following the triumphal chariot of alexander ) the emperor claudius later had alexander 's face replaced with that of his grandfather augustus when a cobbler commented on his mistakes in painting a shoe , apelles made the corrections that very night ; the next morning the cobbler noticed the changes , and proud of his effect on the artist 's work began to criticize how apelles portrayed the leg—whereupon apelles emerged from his hiding-place to state : ne sutor ultra crepidam— '' let the shoemaker venture no further than the shoe when protogenes returned , and the old woman explained what had taken place , he examined the line and pronounced that only apelles could have done so perfect a piece of work ; protogenes then dipped a brush into another colour and drew a still finer line above the first one , and asked his servant to show this to the visitor should he return he was so unsuccessful that , in a rage , he gave up and threw the sponge he was using to clean his brushes with at the medium , and its mark produced the effect of the horse 's foam ptolemy demanded to know who had given apelles the invitation , and with a piece of charcoal from the fireplace apelles drew a likeness on the wall , which ptolemy recognized as his jester in the first strokes of the sketch '' pliny states that apelles made a number of useful innovations to the art of painting , but his recipe for a black varnish , called by pliny atramentum—which served both to preserve his paintings and to soften their colour , and created an effect that pliny praises to no end—apelles kept secret and was lost with his death he was probably right , given that the sculptor lysippus was alexander 's court portraitist with such success that he became the recognized court painter of macedon , and his picture of alexander holding a thunderbolt ranked in the minds of many with the alexander with the spear of the sculptor lysippus this tale is a literary trope epitomizing the sublime simplicity of the greatest art in the hands of a consummate artist : comparable examples are giotto 's perfect circle , drawn freehand , and the scholar-painter chuang-tzu 's perfect crab , which , following ten years of preparation , was drawn in a single stroke without lifting his ink brush from the paper observing in the studio a panel protogenes had prepared for a painting , apelles walked over to the easel , and taking up a brush told the servant to tell protogenes '' this came from me , '' and drew in colour an extremely fine line across the panel pliny also recorded an anecdote that was making the rounds among hellenistic connoisseurs of the first century ce : apelles travelled to protogenes ' home in rhodes to make the acquaintance of this painter he had heard so much about gombrich , 'the heritage of apelles ' , the heritage of apelles : studies in the art of renaissance , ( cornell university press : ithaca , new york , 1976 ) , pp 3–18 a portrait of antigonus i monophthalmus on horseback , in a three-quarters view which artfully concealed the subject 's blind eye ; a portrait of artemis surrounded by a group of maidens offering a sacrifice , based on odyssey 6.102ff ; sacrifice in kos , described in the mimes ( 4.59 ) of herodas
