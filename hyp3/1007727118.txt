public policy can be conceptualized in varying ways , according to the purposes of the speaker or author , and the characteristics of the situation they are concerned with one dividing-line in conceptions of public policy is between those that see it primarily in terms of ideas ( principles and plans of action ) and those that see as a collection of empirical phenomena ( the things that are done , and their outcomes ) david easton in the usa of the 1950s provided an illustration of the need he found to broaden his conceptualization of public policy beyond stated ideas : '' if the formal policy of an educational system forbids discrimination against negroes but local school boards or administrators so zone school attendance that negroes are segregated in a few schools , both the impartial law and discriminatory practices must be considered part of the policy other definitions of public policy in terms of a broad range of empirical phenomena include that of paul cairney : '' the sum total of government action from signals of intent to the final outcomes '' guy peters defines public policy as '' the set of activities that governments engage in for the purpose of changing their economy and society '' , effectively saying that public policy is legislation brought in with the aim of benefiting or impacting the electorate in some way '' other scholars define public policy as a system of '' courses of action , regulatory measures , laws , and funding priorities concerning a given topic promulgated by a governmental entity or its representatives '' public policy focuses on the decisions that create the outputs of a political system , such as transport policies , the management of a public health service , the administration of a system schooling and the organization of a defense force public policy making can be characterized as a dynamic , complex , and interactive system through which public problems are identified and resolved through the creation of new policy or reform of existing policy public problems can originate in endless ways and require different policy responses ( such as regulations , subsidies , import quotas , and laws ) on the local , national , or international level therefore , john kingdon 's model suggests the policy window appears through the emergence and connection of problems , politics and policies , emphasizing the rare opportunity to simulate and initiate new policies alarmed discovery and euphoric enthusiasm : something is identified as a problem , supported awareness by media to pursue seriousness of problem realization of costs which will be incurred by the solutions : investigating through cost-benefit analysis , bringing awareness of financial , environmental , structural curbs to consider solutions and what makes for their consequences as an example , the agenda setting stage is followed by the policy formulation , this will continue until the policy is implemented this is the process of assessing the extent to which the policy has been successful , or if this was the right policy to begin with/ was it implemented correctly and if so , did it go as expected however , the policy cycle is illustrated in a chronological and cyclical structure which could be misleading as in actuality , policymaking would include overlapping stages between the multiple interactions of policy proposals , adjustments , decision-making amongst multiple government institutions and respective authoritative actors each system is influenced by different public problems and issues , and has different stakeholders ; as such , each requires different public policy in public policy making , numerous individuals , corporations , non-profit organizations and interest groups compete and collaborate to influence policymakers to act in a particular way kilpatrick the large set of actors in the public policy process , such as politicians , civil servants , lobbyists , domain experts , and industry or sector representatives , use a variety of tactics and tools to advance their aims , including advocating their positions publicly , attempting to educate supporters and opponents , and mobilizing allies on a particular issue many actors can be important in the public policy process , but government officials ultimately choose public policy in response to the public issue or problem at hand whilst the conservatives saw reducing the national debt as an absolute priority , the labour party , since the effects of conservative austerity became apparent , have slated the policy for its 'needless ' pressure on the working classes and those reliant on welfare , their 2019 election manifesto stating '' tory cuts have pushed our public services to breaking point ” and that & nbsp ; “ the conservatives have starved our education system of funding ” policy design entails conscious and deliberate effort to define policy aims and map them instrumentally nevertheless , policy design is elemental for the succession of public policy , with it comes intricate and multi-level approaches but it is necessary for good , careful policy design to be considered before implementing the policy data-driven policy is a policy designed by a government based on existing data , evidence , rational analysis and use of information technology to crystallize problems and highlight effective solutions evidence-based policy is associated with afm smith because in his 1996 presidential address to the royal statistical society , smith questioned the current process of policy making and urged for a more “ evidence-based approach ” commenting that it has “ valuable lessons to offer ” still , the language of evidence-based policy is widely used and , as such , can be interpreted to reflect a desire for evidence to be used well or appropriately in one way or another – such as by ensuring systematic consideration of rigorous and high quality policy relevant evidence , or by avoiding biased and erroneous applications of evidence for political ends as an academic discipline , public policy brings in elements of many social science fields and concepts , including economics , sociology , political economy , social policy , program evaluation , policy analysis , and public management , all as applied to problems of governmental administration , management , and operations however , the wave of economic globalization that occurred in the late 20th and early 21st centuries created a need for a subset of public policy that focused on global governance , especially as it relates to issues that transcend national borders such as climate change , terrorism , nuclear proliferation , and economic development in particular , a member of the chicago school of economics , thomas sowell writes “ under popularly elected government , the political incentives are to do what is popular , even if the consequences are worse than the consequences of doing nothing , or doing something that is less popular ” therefore since “ economics studies the consequences of decisions that are made about the use of land , labour , capital and other resources that go into producing the volume of output which determines a country ’ s standard of living ” this means that artificially tampering with the allocation of scarce resources such as implementing certain public policies such as price controls will cause inefficiency in the economy and decline the standard of living within society
