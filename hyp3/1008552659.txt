in contrast to the film , the historical de sade was '' not at the height of his literary career nor of his literary powers '' while at charenton , nor did he cut the '' tall , trim figure of the australian actor geoffrey rush '' but was of middling height and , at the time , of a '' considerable , even a grotesque , obesity '' schaeffer especially criticized the depiction of the de sade as a '' martyr to the oppression and censorship of church and state '' and that the film distorted facts '' to a surreal and didactic conclusion that has no connection with the truth , and is probably overwrought even as a twist of a fictional plot '' , namely that '' the seemingly good people are all bad underneath , are all hypocrites , while the seemingly bad person , de sade , probably has some redeeming qualities '' schaeffer criticized also the film 's treatment of de sade 's personal relations regarding his wife ( who had formally separated from him after the revolution ) , the chambermaid ( who did not serve as a liaison to a publisher but with whom he had a sexual relationship from her early teens until shortly before his death ) , and his '' companion of many years '' who had a room at charenton ( and actually smuggled out the manuscripts ) but is ignored by the film '' ;

a very modern lesson , it would seem schaeffer , whose the marquis de sade : a life was used by director philip kaufman as reference , in a review published in the guardian , criticized the film for historical inaccuracies and for simplifying de sade 's complex life '' schaeffer advised the viewer to distinguish between de sade and the protagonist of the film : '' to see if quills is valid in its own terms , let the viewer imagine it is about someone else , let us say the marquis de newcastle , and that the scene is bedlam and then see if the movie makes any sense '' according to kaufman , doug wright did not have the rights to the original translations and therefore had to create and write the passages of de sade 's work that are included in the original play and the film kenneth turan of the los angeles times dismissed the film as an '' overripe contrivance masquerading as high art '' , while de sade biographer neil schaeffer in the guardian criticized the film for historical inaccuracies and for simplifying de sade 's complex life '' the film was not without its detractors , including richard schickel of time magazine , who decried director philip kaufman 's approach as '' brutally horrific , vulgarly unamusing '' , creating a film that succeeds only as '' soft-gore porn '' peter travers for rolling stone wrote about the '' exceptional '' actors , particularly geoffrey rush 's '' scandalously good '' performance as the marquis , populating a film that is '' literate , erotic , and spoiling to be heard '' kate winslet as madeleine '' maddy '' leclerc ; screenwriter doug wright called winslet the '' patron saint '' of the movie for being the first big name to back it , expressing interest as early as april 1999 the manuscripts smuggled out of the asylum were not the novel justine , which features prominently in the film but was published thirteen years before de sade 's incarceration at the asylum he applied the vocabulary used in the translations to the passages to imitate de sade 's style but the archaic language comes across as funny to a modern viewer whereas in the 1700s , as stated by kaufman , these words were '' incendiary '' the film was also nominated by the hollywood foreign press , organizers of the golden globes , for best actor in a drama ( geoffrey rush ) and best screenplay ( doug wright ) several years later , the marquis is confined to the asylum for the insane at charenton , overseen by the enlightened abbé de coulmier geoffrey rush as the marquis de sade ;
