this identification departed from the prevailing belief that the protein content of chromosomes probably was the anatomical structure of genes , although it would take another decade—till watson and crick 's 1953 paper in nature indicating dna 's molecular structure suggesting how a molecule as seemingly simple as dna could encode the structure of proteins—for the interpretation of dna as genes to become widely accepted bacteriologist fred neufeld , of the robert koch institute in berlin , germany , had earlier identified the pneumococcal types , confirmed and expanded by alphonse dochez at oswald avery 's laboratory in america at the rockefeller hospital over the following years , avery 's illness , graves ' disease , kept him much out of his laboratory as other researchers in it experimented to determine , largely by process of elimination , which constituent was the transforming factor illustrating the plasticity of streptococcus pneumoniae , the abstract of griffith 's paper reports , '' the s form of type i has been produced from the r form of type ii , and the r form of type i has been transformed into the s form of type ii '' avery biographer and colleague at the rockefeller institute , microbiologist rene dubos , recruited by the rockefeller institute from france , later described griffith 's findings as '' exploding a bombshell in the field of pneumococcal immunology '' more accurately , point six of griffith 's abstract reports that r tended to transform into s if a large amount of live r , alone , were injected , and that adding much heat-killed s made transformation reliable griffith also induced some pneumococci to transform back and forth one of america 's most prominent pneumococcus experts , oswald avery , in new york at the rockefeller hospital—which opened in 1910 on the rockefeller institute 's campus—initially explained that griffith 's experiments must have been poorly conducted and succumbed to contamination griffith was sent pneumococci samples taken from patients throughout the country , amassed a large number , and would type—in other words classify—each pneumococci sample to search patterns of pneumonia epidemiology , and griffith experimented on mice for improved understanding of its pathology during world war i ( 1914–18 ) , the local government board 's laboratory was assumed by the national government , namely uk government , and became the ministry of health 's pathological laboratory—where griffith was medical officer in 1944 identification of the transforming factor was published in the journal of experimental medicine by avery , colin macleod , and maclyn mccarty of the rockefeller hospital by 1967 pneumococcal transformation had been shown to occur in vivo naturally , and it was further shown that treatment with streptomycin during dual infection by two pneumococcal strains could increase transformation—and virulence—while for the first time pneumococcal transformation was shown to occur in the respiratory tract
