these breeds were bred with the indigenous african dogs , including the dog of the khoikhoi people , which resulted in the boer hunting dogs , generically called names such as boerhund ( boer hound ) in dutch then its descendant language of afrikaans , which are the chief forerunners to the modern rhodesian ridgeback in 1954 the first challenge certificates were awarded to dogs shown as rhodesian ridgebacks at united kingdom competitions , toward their subsequent recognition by the kennel club of great britain , and in 1955 the american kennel club recognised the rhodesian ridgeback breed as a member of the hound group barnes on founding the first ridgeback club at a bulawayo kennel club show , then in southern rhodesia ( now in zimbabwe ) , and based on that of the dalmatian reverend charles helm ( 1844â€“1915 ) , son of reverend daniel helm of the london missionary society , was born in the cape colony , joined the london missionary society himself , and moved from the zuurbraak ( now suurbraak ) mission station just east of swellendam ( modern western cape province , south africa ) to the hope fountain mission in matabeleland , southern rhodesia , travelling from october 1874 to december 1875 , then bringing two ridged dog dog from somewhere between kimberley ( modern northern cape province , south africa ) and swellendam with him to hope fountain in 1879 en route to becoming , as it would turn out , a political advisor to king lobengula , house-host to hunter-explorer frederick selous , postmaster of bulawayo and well-appreciated tooth-extractor similarly , in 1952 , the rhodesian ridgeback club of great britain was founded at crufts to promote the breed around the united kingdom to show judges , so a standard for the breed might be recognised the appearance standard of the ridgeback originated in zimbabwe ( rhodesia ) and goes back to the year 1922 , and by 2019 this standard had remained virtually unchanged the khoekhoe people who lived in the cape peninsula when the dutch began trading with the area during the mid 17th century , had a hunting dog which was described as ugly , but noted for its ferocity when acting as a guard dog in 1927 , barnes ' standard was approved by the south african kennel union 6 by the 1860s , european colonisers had also imported a variety of mainly european dog breeds to this area of africa , including such dedicated hunting dogs as great danes , bloodhounds , greyhounds , and terriers the presence of black guard hairs or ticking is not addressed in the akc standard , although the elaboration of the akc standard notes the amount of black or dark brown in the coat should not be excessive 1860 , uitenhage , modern eastern cape province , south africa ) , a big & ndash ; game hunter , was married to maria vermaak of bloemhof by reverend helm in 1879 the same year helm brought his two rough-coated grey-black bitches to the mission lorna kennedy at the university of manchester 's centre for integrated genomic medical research in england has found the haplotype ( group of genes ) , which , when present , double the chances of a ridgeback becoming hypothyroid due to lymphocytic thyroiditis the thai ridgeback is a crossbreed of the phu quoc ; historians have speculated the relationship between the rhodesian ridgeback and the phu quoc with suggestions that historically one breed may have been imported to the other 's location one possible reason for these studies to deviate from the expected 25 % incidence of ridgelessness is inclusion of parents who were not heterozygous ( possessing a copy of both the ridgeless and ridged allele ) in the study they became the foundation stock of a kennel which developed dogs over the next 35 years with the ability to bay a lion , to not attack it but to harass it by darting in and out but staying out of its reach until the hunter shot it the ears have been described both as erect but later described as hanging due to interbreeding with european dogs , but the most distinctive feature was the length of hair often growing in the reverse direction along its back note that many matings are required to have a high probability of detecting a homozygous dominant ( once a ridgeless pup is produced , the animal in question is assumed to be heterozygous without question ) , and more than one sire can produce the pups in one litter however , while the few studies that have analyzed the issue do not agree on the incidence of ridgelessness within the breed , they all show a ridgeless rate significantly lower than 25 % , which can not be explained using the punnett square model for single gene/two allele inheritance 11 the original breed standard was drafted in 1922 by f the inclusion of homozygotes ( possessing two copies of the ridged alleles ) would make the observed incidence be less than 25 % when averaged across the population in the study this is done by palpation of the subcutaneous dorsal midline from the base of the skull to the insertion of the tail according to the test results in practice , it appears that the ridge genetics in rhodesian ridgebacks is not so simple and is characterized by incomplete manifestation of ridge gene ( more info here )
