111 plant growth enhances germination , plant growth , and crop yield it helps in root and plant growth enriches soil with micro-organisms ( adding plant hormones such as auxins and gibberellic acid ) economic biowastes conversion reduces waste flow to landfills elimination of biowastes from the waste stream reduces contamination of other recyclables collected in a single bin ( a common problem in communities practicing single-stream recycling ) creates low-skill jobs at local level low capital investment and relatively simple technologies make vermicomposting practical for less-developed agricultural regions environmental helps to close the '' metabolic gap '' through recycling waste on-site large systems often use temperature control and mechanized harvesting , however other equipment is relatively simple and does not wear out quickly production reduces greenhouse gas emissions such as methane and nitric oxide ( produced in landfills or incinerators when not composted ) species most often used for composting include : eisenia fetida , the red wiggler or tiger worm ( eisenia andrei ) lumbricus rubellus , does not adapt as well to the shallow compost bin as does eisenia fetida eisenia hortensis , european nightcrawlers , aka dendrobaenas , dendras , and nightcrawlers eudrilus eugeniae , african nightcrawlers perionyx excavatus , blueworms may be used in the tropics this includes : all fruits and vegetables ( including citrus , in limited quantities ) vegetable and fruit peels and ends coffee grounds and filters tea bags ( even those with high tannin levels ) grains such as bread , cracker and cereal ( including moldy and stale ) eggshells ( rinsed off ) leaves and grass clippings ( not sprayed with pesticides ) newspapers ( most inks used in newspapers are not toxic ) paper toweling ( which has not been used with cleaners or chemicals ) it is necessary to monitor the temperatures of large-scale bin systems ( which can have high heat capacity properties ) , as the raw materials or feedstocks used can compost , heating up the worm bins as they decay and killing the worms soil improves soil aeration enriches soil with micro-organisms ( adding enzymes such as phosphatase and cellulase ) microbial activity in worm castings is 10 to 20 times higher than in the soil and organic matter that the worm ingests attracts deep-burrowing earthworms already present in the soil improves water holding capacity appelhof , p the earthworm species ( or composting worms ) most often used are red wigglers ( eisenia fetida or eisenia andrei ) , though european nightcrawlers ( eisenia hortensis , synonym dendrobaena veneta ) and red earthworm ( lumbricus rubellus ) could also be used here the worms are fed an inch of '' worm chow '' across the top of the bed , and an inch of castings are harvested from below by pulling a breaker bar across the large mesh screen which forms the base of the bed containing water-soluble nutrients , vermicompost is a nutrient-rich organic fertilizer and soil conditioner in a form that is relatively easy for plants to absorb some systems use a windrow , which consists of bedding materials for the earthworms to live in and acts as a large bin ; organic material is added to it as they are shallow-dwelling and feed on decomposing plant matter in the soil , they adapt easily to living on food or plant waste in the confines of a worm bin in this process , compost is separated into large clumps , which is placed back into composting for further breakdown , and lighter compost , with which the rest of the process continues composting worms which are detritivorous ( eaters of trash ) , such as the red wiggler eisenia fetida , are epigeic ( surface dwellers ) and together with symbiotic associated microbes are the ideal vectors for decomposing food waste because the small-scale and home systems use a varied mix of feedstocks , the nitrogen , phosphorus , and potassium ( npk ) content of the resulting vermicompost will also be inconsistent if decomposition becomes anaerobic from excess wet feedstock added to the bin , or the layers of food waste have become too deep , the bin will begin to smell of ammonia if decomposition has become anaerobic , to restore healthy conditions and prevent the worms from dying , excess waste water must be reduced and the bin returned to a normal moisture level however , in one study it has been found that homemade backyard vermicompost was lower in microbial biomass , soil microbial activity , and yield of a species of ryegrass than municipal compost increases in the total nitrogen content in vermicompost , an increase in available nitrogen and phosphorus , as well as the increased removal of heavy metals from sludge and soil have been reported to do this , first reduce addition of food scraps with a high moisture content and second , add fresh , dry bedding such as shredded newspaper to your bin , mixing it in well although the windrow has no physical barriers to prevent worms from escaping , in theory they should not , due to an abundance of organic matter for them to feed on maintaining the correct ph ( close to neutral ) and water content of the bin ( just enough water where squeezed bedding drips a couple of drops ) can help avoid these pests as well the vermicompost may be used for farming , landscaping , to create compost tea , or for sale unlike other compost , worm castings also contain mucus which helps prevent nutrients from washing away with the first watering and holds moisture better than plain soil because red worms are surface dwellers constantly moving towards the new food source , the flow-through system eliminates the need to separate worms from the castings before packaging vermicomposting is widely used in north america for on-site institutional processing of food scraps , such as in hospitals , universities , shopping malls , and correctional facilities in order to avoid over-fertilization issues , such as nitrogen burn , vermicompost can be diluted as a tea 50:50 with water , or as a solid can be mixed in 50:50 with potting soil the most common worms used in composting systems , redworms ( eisenia fetida , eisenia andrei , and lumbricus rubellus ) feed most rapidly at temperatures of 15–25 & nbsp ; °c ( 59-77 & nbsp ; °f )
