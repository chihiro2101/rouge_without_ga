it is far and away the hardiest member of its genus , and can grow well in western and central europe ( north to the faroe islands and smøla in western norway ) , the west coast of north america ( north to baranof island in alaska ) , and locally on the east coast , as far north as long island , and in new zealand and southeastern australia in 1789 , de jussieu erected a new genus called araucaria based on the species , and in 1797 , pavón published a new description of the species which he called araucaria imbricata ( an invalid name , as it did not use molina 's older species epithet ) file : monkey puzzle tree in snow at kew.jpg juvenile tree in winter file : p.n.nahuelbuta2.jpg mixed forest of araucaria and coigüe in nahuelbuta national park , chile araucaria araucana ( 8 ) sir william molesworth , the owner of a young specimen at pencarrow garden near bodmin in cornwall , was showing it to a group of friends , when one of them – the noted barrister and benthamist charles austin – remarked , '' it would puzzle a monkey to climb that '' the leaf are thick , tough , and scale-like , triangular , long , broad at the base , and with sharp edges and tips , rather similar to the leaves of the unrelated succulent plant , crassula muscosa members of the genus araucaria in the pacific islands and australia include araucaria cunninghamii , hoop pine , araucaria heterophylla , the norfolk island pine and araucaria bidwillii , bunya pine its piñones , or seeds , are edible , similar to large pine nuts , and are harvested by indigenous peoples in argentina and chile once valued because of its long , straight trunk , its current rarity and vulnerable status mean its wood is now rarely used ; it is also sacred to some members of the mapuche native american tribe file : araucaria araucana playa.jpg araucaria araucana in the andes file : conguillio national park.jpg bark of a tree in conguillío national park , chile file : araucaria araucana cones.jpg female cones file : araucaria araucana0.jpg male cones file : araucaria araucana2.jpg part of a branch of a cultivated tree file : araucaria araucana 03.jpg a the origin of the popular english language name '' monkey puzzle '' derives from its early cultivation in britain in about 1850 , when the species was still very rare in gardens and not widely known the name araucana is derived from the native mapuche who used the nuts ( seeds ) of the tree in chile large fires burned thousands of acres of araucaria forest in 2001–2002 , and areas of national parks have also burned , destroying trees over 1300 years old the tree , however , does not yield seeds until it is around 30 to 40 years old , which discourages investment in planting orchards ( although yields at maturity can be immense ) ; once established , it can live possibly as long as 1,000 years
