between 1893 and 1906 , under the direction of solon bailey , the telescope at this site was used to survey photographically both the large and small magellanic clouds in 1908 , the results of her study were published , which showed that a type of variable star called a '' cluster variable '' , later called a cepheid variable after the prototype star delta cephei , showed a definite relationship between the variability period and the star 's apparent brightness leavitt reaized that since all the stars in the smc are roughly the same distance from earth , this result implied that there is similar relationship between period and absolute brightness by comparing this to the periodicity of the variables as measured by leavitt , he was able to estimate a distance of 10,000 parsecs ( 30,000 light years ) between the sun and the smc there is a bridge of gas connecting the small magellanic cloud with the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , which is evidence of tidal interaction between the galaxies in 2017 , using dark energy survey plus maglites data , a stellar over-density associated with the small magellanic cloud was discovered , which is probably the result of interactions between smc and lmc recent star formation has led to a large population of massive stars and high-mass x-ray binaries ( hmxbs ) which are the relics of the short-lived upper end of the initial mass function 2010 have now cataloged several hundred x-ray sources in the direction of the smc , of which perhaps half are considered likely hmxbs , and the remainder a mix of foreground stars , and background agn uhuru observed the smc on january 1 , 12 , 13 , 16 , and 17 , 1971 , and detected one source located at 01149-7342 , which was then designated smc x-1 visvanathan that the smc may in fact be split in two , with a smaller section of this galaxy behind the main part of the smc ( as seen from earth perspective ) , and separated by about 30,000 ly nasa extragalactic database entry on the smc seds entry on the smc smc at esa/hubble astronomy picture of the day 2010 january 7 the tail of the small magellanic cloud - likely stripped from the galaxy by gravitational tides , the tail contains mostly gas , dust , and newly formed stars
