one of the most important marks that mahler left on the symphony as a genre is the incorporation of another important genre of the 19th century ; the lied through the use of the second of his lieder eines fahrenden gesellen cycle , '' '' , we can see how the composer manipulates the song 's form to accommodate the symphonic form of the three verses , the more relaxed third verse is used at the beginning of the exposition , whereas the more chromatic and rhythmically active first and second verses are found in the closing section , helping build the energy to the end of the exposition in the third movement of the symphony , the quotation of the lied '' '' demonstrates the subtlety with which mahler combined the two genres in the last verse of the song cycle , the speaker acknowledges the painlessness of death , saying , '' under the linden tree i knew not how life fared , there all was good again ! '' this melody is employed as a countermelody to the '' frère jacques '' theme in the minor mode , but the counterpoint that mahler uses is unconventional , and the two melodies are never properly consolidated this unresolved counterpoint has been interpreted as a conflict between the '' frère jacques '' theme 's catholic implications and the jewish klezmer qualities of the '' '' theme , thus alluding to a social conflict of which mahler was very aware it was originally scored for a small orchestra and this is how it appears in blumine , which is in contrast to the large orchestra used in the rest of the symphony it was rediscovered by donald mitchell in 1966 , while doing research for his biography on mahler in the osborn collection at yale university , in a copy of the hamburg version of the symphony 1889 – 20 november , world première : budapest , budapest philharmonic orchestra conducted by the composer 1893 – 27 october , german première : hamburg , conducted by the composer 1894 – 3 june , weimar , conducted by the composer 1896 – 16 march , berlin , conducted by the composer 1899 – 8 march , frankfurt , conducted by the composer 1898 – 3 march , czech première : prague , conducted by the composer 1900 – 18 november , austrian première : vienna , conducted by the composer 1903 – 21 october , english première : london as part of a proms concert , conducted by henry wood 1903 – 25 october , dutch première : amsterdam , with the composer conducting the concertgebouw orchestra 1 ( '' titan '' ) - a beginners ' guide - overview , analysis and the best recordings - the classic review the music of mahler : a catalogue of manuscript and printed sources the entry for the first symphony outlines the work 's history , provides a list of performances up to 1911 , a discography of early recordings , and detailed descriptions of the surviving manuscript and printed sources
