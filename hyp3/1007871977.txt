the battle was a major success for the french and a major setback for the british , and greatly added to the reputation of montcalm , who boasted of his victory and often exaggerated his claims in writings back to france while disparaging the efforts of the canadian and native fighters montcalm also accused vaudreuil of purposely sending his troops , and montcalm specifically , into a slaughter based on the size of the respective forces , a claim quickly refuted by vaudreuil , who subsequently requested that montcalm be recalled to france and that the chevalier de lévis be appointed to succeed him in the second half of 1758 , the british began to take the upper hand in north america , due on one part to the massive resources they organized against the french and on the other part to the lack of reinforcements and supplies from france to support its colony , which was already on the brink of starvation following a catastrophic harvest they include : rue montcalm , montreal , quebec montcalm avenue , plattsburgh , new york montcalm , new hampshire montcalm secondary school , london , ontario rue montcalm ( montcalm street ) , hull , quebec montcalm street , detroit montcalm avenue , st catharines montcalm street , vancouver , british columbia montcalm street , ottawa , ontario montcalm street , ticonderoga , new york , named in 1933 montcalm avenue , buffalo , new york montcalm park , on the site of the former fort george , oswego , new york montcalm avenue ( originally '' avenue du montcalm '' ) , in the historically french city of plattsburgh , new york , 18 miles south of the canada-us border montcalm high school , montcalm , west virginia , although the area is not historically connected to france or the french and indian war palais montcalm , quebec city , quebec montcalm avenue , brighton , massachusetts lake montcalm , montcalm county , michigan montcalm county in western michigan four vessels of the french navy have been named in his honour : an ( 1865–1891 ) an armoured cruiser ( 1898–1926 ) a french cruiser montcalm ( 1935 ) ( 1933–1969 , served in the free french naval forces ) an f70 type frigate ( 1975–2017 ) the montcalm squadron of cadets at the royal military college of canada was named in his honour many sites and landmarks were named to honour montcalm when the seven years ' war spread to new france , king louis xv sent brigadier general montcalm to the colonies as commander-in-chief , with colonel chevalier de levis now as his second-in-command and capitaine louis antoine de bougainville as his new aide-de-camp ' '' montcalm quoted in waging the war that way would ensure the preservation and extension of french military honour , which was of particular importance to the king and his government after the loss of fort beauséjour at the outset of the war under the terms of the surrender , the garrison was to be escorted back to fort edward , where they would be barred from serving against the french for 18 months , and all british prisoners were to be returned to the french , who also kept all the stores and ammunition '' montcalm quoted in the conflict between montcalm and vaudreuil would be largely solved or at least rendered irrelevant when , in 1758 , the former was promoted to the rank of lieutenant general , thus outranking the latter , and acquiring a virtually free hand in the determination of military strategy concerned by the number of british troops amassing near the border , montcalm left to visit fort carillon to inspect the defenses while the governor general , pierre de rigaud , marquis de vaudreuil-cavagnial , began to prepare troops at fort frontenac for a potential assault on oswego , a british fort across lake ontario similarly , vaudreuil would consistently write to the minister of the navy to complain about montcalm 's insubordination in the hope of having him replaced ; montcalm been made subordinate to the former by the royal council in the hope of avoiding any disagreements over strategy , despite otherwise holding equivalent ranks conversely , vaudreuil was of the opinion that the war should be waged as based on established '' colonial methods , '' which meant extending fortifications consistently repelling british incursions , '' defending the soil of our frontiers foot by foot against the enemy , '' fighting defensively , raiding extensively , and ( most importantly ) securing and relying heavily on native participation by not waiting to bring up his heavy guns to blast the weak wooden defenses and failing to capitalize on a major flaw in the french lines , which would have allowed the british troops to easily outflank the garrison , abercrombie enabled the french to sustain steady musket fire and hold off the attack the culture of the french metropolitan officer led montcalm and others like him to see the seven years ' war in terms of a defence of their own and their kingdom 's honour , regardless of what it meant for new france conversely , the culture of the canadian colonial officer led vaudreuil and others like him to interpret the war in terms of a defence of the territorial integrity of new france and thus its very existence in a letter addressed to general wolfe , who unbeknownst to him had also fallen in battle , montcalm attempted to surrender the city , despite the fact he did not hold the authority to do so
