chondrification ( also known as chondrogenesis ) is the process by which cartilage is formed from condensed mesenchyme tissue , which differentiates into chondroblasts and begins secreting the molecules ( aggrecan and collagen type ii ) that form the extracellular matrix the division of cells within cartilage occurs very slowly , and thus growth in cartilage is usually not based on an increase in size or mass of the cartilage itself cartilage growth thus refers to the matrix deposition , but can also refer to both the growth and remodeling of the extracellular matrix due to the great stress on the patellofemoral joint during resisted knee extension , the articular cartilage of the patella is among the thickest in the human body the mechanical properties of articular cartilage in load-bearing joints such as the knee and hip have been studied extensively at macro , micro , and nano-scales lubricin , a glycoprotein abundant in cartilage and synovial fluid , plays a major role in bio-lubrication and wear protection of cartilage also , because hyaline cartilage does not have a blood supply , the deposition of new matrix is slow osteoarthritis : osteoarthritis is a disease of the whole joint , however , one of the most affected tissues is the articular cartilage the cartilage covering bones ( articular cartilageâ€”a subset of hyaline cartilage ) is thinned , eventually completely wearing away , resulting in a '' bone against bone '' within the joint , leading to reduced motion , and pain it is treated by arthroplasty , the replacement of the joint by a synthetic joint often made of a stainless steel alloy ( cobalt chromoly ) and ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene ( uhmwpe ) often when athletes talk of damaged '' cartilage '' in their knee , they are referring to a damaged meniscus ( a fibrocartilage structure ) and not the articular cartilage for in vitro x-ray scans , the outer soft tissue is most likely removed , so the cartilage and air boundary are enough to contrast the presence of cartilage due to the refraction of the x-ray other type of cartilage found in limulus polyphemus is the endosternite cartilage , a fibrous-hyaline cartilage with chondrocytes of typical morphology in a fibrous component , much more fibrous than vertebrate hyaline cartilage , with mucopolysaccharides immunoreactive against chondroitin sulfate antibodies the embryos of limulus polyphemus express cola and hyaluronan in the gill cartilage and the endosternite , which indicates that these tissues are fibrillar-collagen-based cartilage it has been observed that this species presents the expression soxd and soxe , analogs of the vertebrate sox5/6 and sox9 , in the developing cartilage the odontophore is a vesicular cell rich cartilage , consisting of vacuolated cells containing myoglobin , surrounded by a low amount of extra cellular matrix containing collagen
