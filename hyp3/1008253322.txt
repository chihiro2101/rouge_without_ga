if a section of an article is a magnet for unhelpful contributions ( such as the '' external links '' section or trivia sections ) , be aware that while moving it to another article may help to clean up the main article , it creates a new article that consists entirely of a section for unwanted contributions if there is no '' natural '' way to split or reduce a long list or table , it may be best to leave it intact , and a decision made to either keep it embedded in the main article or split it off into a stand-alone page ) a note should also be made in the edit summary of the source article , '' split content to article name '' , to protect against the article subsequently being deleted and the history of the new page eradicated to conform with wp : c , which permit modification and reuse but require attribution of the content contributors , the new page should be created with an edit summary attesting proper copy attribution , such as '' split content from article name '' some useful rules of thumb for splitting articles , and combining small pages : ; please note : these rules of thumb apply only to readable prose and not to wiki markup size ( as found on history lists or other means ) , and each kb can be equated to 1,000 characters if you have encountered an article that is so long you ca n't edit it , or if your browser chops off the end of the article when you try to edit it , there are a few ways you can solve the problem when you split a section from a long article into an independent article , you should leave a short summary of the material that is removed along with a pointer to the independent article markup size includes readable prose , the wiki codes , and any media used in the article , such as images or audio clips special : longpages wikipedia : abundance and redundancy wikipedia : article series wikipedia : content removal wikipedia : database reports/long pages wikipedia : database reports/long stubs wikipedia : database reports/talk pages by size wikipedia : featured articles/by length wikipedia : out of scope wikipedia : template limits wikipedia : too much detail wikipedia : writing better articles stay on topic if an article includes large amounts of material not suitable for inclusion in the encyclopedia , it is better to remove that content than to create a new article for it a relatively trivial topic may be appropriate in the context of the larger article , but inappropriate as the topic of an entire article in itself number of characters in an article can be found with the help of xtools ( also accessible via page history from page statistics link at the top ) under '' prose '' in the '' general statistics '' section ; shubinator 's dyk tool ; or prosesize readable prose is the main body of the text , excluding material such as footnotes and reference sections ( '' see also '' , '' external links '' , bibliography , etc note that the ability to wikipedia : section decreases wait time , removing some of the many , oversized-page problems for editors ; however , readers with slow modems will still have to wait for the entire page to load in the independent article , put the or tag on the talk page to create a banner that refers back to the main article some large articles exist for topics that require depth and detail , but typically articles of such size are split into two or more smaller articles it also violates the neutral point of view policy to create a new article specifically to contain information that consensus has rejected from the main article
