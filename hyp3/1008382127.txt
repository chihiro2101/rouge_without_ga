the party was founded on 7 april 1947 as the arab ba'ath party by michel aflaq ( an antiochian christian ) , salah al-din al-bitar ( a sunni muslim ) , and the followers of zaki al-arsuzi ( an atheist ) in damascus , syria , leading to the establishment of the syrian regional branch the 2nd national congress was convened in june 1954 , and elected a seven-man national command ; aflaq , bitar , and akram al-hawrani were elected and represented the syrian regional branch , while abdullah rimawi and abdallah na'was were elected to represent the jordanian branch the congress is notable for sanctioning the merger of the arab socialist movement and the ba'ath party , which took place in 1952 the syrian regional branch rose to prominence in the 1940s and 1950s ; in the 1954 parliamentary elections the syrian regional branch won 22 seats in parliament , becoming the second largest party in the country its new , strengthened position , was used successfully to garner support for syria 's merger with gamal abdel nasser 's egypt , which led to the establishment of the united arab republic ( uar ) in 1958 in light of these criticisms , the ba'ath convened the 3rd national congress ( held 27 august – 1 september 1959 ) , which was attended by delegates from '' iraq , lebanon , jordan , south arabia , the gulf , arab south , arab maghreb , palestine and party student organisations in arab and other universities outside the arab homeland '' the congress is notable for endorsing the dissolution of the syrian regional branch , which had been decided by aflaq and bitar without inner-party consultation in 1958 , and for expelling rimawi , the regional secretary of the jordanian regional branch rimawi reacted to his expulsion by forming his own party , the arab socialist revolutionary ba'ath party , which established a rival national command to compete with the original the national command responded to the problems in iraq by appointing a temporary regional command on 2 february 1960 , which appointed talib el-shibib as regional secretary , and on 15 june 1961 the national command expelled rikabi from the party on a separate plan to instigate a military coup against qasim , and who later became the head of the cia 's operations in iraq and syria '' from late 1968 to june 1970 , '' has '' denied any involvement in the ba'ath party 's actions '' the iraqi regional branch , when it took power , was so riven by factionalism that its purported allies launched a counter-coup forcing them out of power in november 1963 the 4th national congress , held in august 1960 , criticized the leadership of aflaq and bitar , called for the reestablishment of the syrian regional branch and deemphasized the party 's commitment to arab nationalism while emphasizing more the socialist character of the party a year after , at the uar 's nadir in syria , the syrian general abd al-karim al-nahlawi launched a coup on 28 september 1961 , which led to the reestablishment of the syrian arab republic he was supported in his ideological reorientation by hammud al-shufi , the regional secretary of the syrian regional branch , yasin al-hafiz , one of the party ’ s few ideological theorists , and by certain members of the secret military committee the marxist-wing gained new ground at the 6th national congress ( held in october 1963 ) , in which the iraqi and syrian regional branches called for the establishment of '' socialist planning '' , '' collective farms run by peasants '' , '' workers ' democratic control of the means of production '' , and other demands reflecting a certain emulation of soviet-style socialism in 1963 the ba'ath party seized power , from then on the ba'ath functioned as the only officially recognized syrian political party , but factionalism and splintering within the party led to a succession of governments and new constitutions on 23 february 1966 , a coup d'état led by salah jadid , the informal head of the military committee , overthrew aflaq and the bitar 's cabinet the coup sprung out of factional rivalry between jadid 's '' regionalist '' ( qutri ) camp , which promoted ambitions for a greater syria and the more traditionally pan-arab , in power faction , called the '' nationalist '' ( qawmi ) faction however , both in iraq and syria , the regional command became the real centre of party power , and the membership of the national command became a largely honorary position , often the destination of figures being eased out of the leadership a consequence of the split was that zaki al-arsuzi took aflaq 's place as the official father of ba'athism in the pro-syrian ba'ath movement , while the pro-iraqi ba'ath movement still considered aflaq the de jure father of ba'athist thought the organizational structure of the ba'ath party was created at the 2nd national congress by amending the party 's internal regulations , which was approved at the party 's 1st national congress in 1947 in ba'athist jargon '' nation '' means the arab nation , because of that , the national command formed the highest policy-making and coordinating council for the ba'ath movement throughout the arab world a '' region '' ( quṭr ) , in ba'athist parlance , is an arab state such as syria , iraq , or lebanon the regional congress , which combined all the provincial branches , was the region 's highest authority and elected a regional command , the party leadership in a specific region , the regional tribunal , the body responsible for discipline inspection , and a regional secretary , the regional party leader underneath the branch was the subbranch , which was made up of three to five sections , '' and was the lowest level of the party to hold a periodical congress from its very beginning , the party was a manifestation of arab nationalist thought , with the party itself referring to itself as '' the party of arab unity '' the pan-arab tendencies of the party 's predecessor , the arab ba'ath movement , was strengthened 1945–1947 by recruiting members from the zaki al-arsuzi 's arab ba'ath it was not islam that modeled the peoples of arabia , the fertile crescent , and north africa , equipping them with islamic values , especially the arabic language and the arabic culture , but the arab nation which created islam of the four members in the 1st executive committee , wahib al-ghanim was the only who paid much attention to the problems of the peasants and workers , because the other members ( aflaq , salah al-din al-bitar and jalil al-sayyide ) had a middle class upbringing and upheld middle class values when the akram al-hawrani 's arab socialist party ( asp ) merged with the ba'ath party , the majority of asp members of peasants origins did not join the ba'ath party , instead becoming personal followers of hawrani the '' transitional ba'ath '' , which grew out of the dissolution of the syrian regional branch in 1958 dissolution and the military committee , were more rural in outlook , policy and ideology the original interpretation of arab socialism did not answer questions such as : how much state control was necessary , or economic equality ; but instead focused on freeing the arab nation and its people from colonization and oppression in general after the failure of the united arab republic ( uar ) , a union of egypt and syria , the ba'ath party was divided into two main factions , the regionalists and the nationalists ( pan-arab ) when the union with egypt collapsed , the ba'ath party was put in a difficult position , the party still sought arab unity , but did not oppose the uar 's dissolution and did not want to seek another union with egypt under gamal abdel nasser 's rule on 21 february 1962 , the national command issued a new policy regarding the pan-arab project by first mentioning the successes and failures of the uar , but ending the statement by calling for the reestablishment of the uar as a decentralized federation with nasser 's egypt the provincial party members had not been told of the syrian regional branch 's dissolution , which in fact broke the communication line with provincial branches and the national command while its true that in 1962 the regionalists supported the slogan , adopted at the 5th national congress , '' the renewal of the union with egypt while taking note of past mistakes '' , they treated such a slogan as a propaganda slogan , and not as a feasible goal jamal al-atassi , who had been a moderate socialist for most of his life , called for the renunciation of arab socialism in 1963 and the adoption of a '' virtually marxist concept of socialism '' by claiming that class conflict was the moving force in society shufi was able , due to his position as head of the organization bureau of the regional command , to recruit several marxist or marxist-leaning members to the top of the syrian regional party hierarchy radical socialists led by ali salih al-sadi took control of the iraqi regional branch in 1963 , which led to the official radicalization of the party 's ideology while the points of departure did n't create a break with the party 's traditional ideology , it criticized the party 's old guard for giving arab unity primacy over socialism and their failure to turn ba'athism into a comprehensive theory the document called for nationalization of the commanding heights of the economy , the slow incorporation of the petty bourgeoisie into the socialist economy and the elimination of the bourgeoisie and its allied classes neo-ba'athism is the dramatic changes that manifested in ba'athist ideology from 1960 to 1964 , and the military committee 's takeover of the syrian regional branch and the national command in the period 1964 to 1966 the 6th national congress signified the takeover of the party by an anti-militarist left , which opposed both the traditional leaders in the national command and the pragmatists in the military committee the military committee , which now controlled the syrian regional branch , took control of the ba'ath party in the coup of 1966 according to middle east expert avraham ben-tzur '' the neo-ba'th in its latest variant is a bureaucratic apparatus headed by the military , whose daily life and routine are shaped by the rigid military oppression on the home front , and soviet aid among others military aid however , efraim karsh and inari rautsi contend that the regional branch was established in the 1940s , but that it received official recognition as a regional branch of the ba'ath party in 1952 by the national command after taking power , the regional branch through its militia , the national guard , initiated what iraqi expert con coughlin referred to as an '' orgy of violence '' against communism and left-wing elements bahjat abu gharbiyah became the regional branch 's first member in the west bank , and was thus resigned the responsibility of building the party 's organization in the area the branch secretary in the west bank , and was thus responsible in that area a resolution was approved , which stated that the party leaders [ aflaq , al-bitar among others had to hastily entered into a union with egypt , had wrongly dissolved the syrian regional branch in 1958 , given pan-arabism primacy when socialism was the more important , the need to use marxist , not ba'athi , tools to analyze the current situation and the need for the party to strengthen their positions amongst the popular classes–the workers , peasants , artisans and shopkeepers at the 7th national congress the national command in collaboration with the military committee either expelled or removed leftists such as those found in the lebanese regional branch from leadership position , and in the most severe cases , expelled them from the party by the end of 1957 , the scp was able to weaken the ba'ath party to such an extent that the ba'ath party drafted a bill in december that called for a union with egypt , a move that proved to be very popular during the congress , aflaq and the military committee , through muhammad umran , made contact for the first time ; the committee asked for permission to initiate a coup d'état ; aflaq supported the conspiracy following the success of the ramadan revolution , led by the ba'ath party 's iraqi regional branch , the military committee hastily convened to hatch a coup against nazim al-kudsi 's presidency the plotters first order was to establish the national council for the revolutionary command ( ncrc ) , consisting entirely of ba'athists and nasserists , and controlled by military personnel rather than civilians from the very beginning
