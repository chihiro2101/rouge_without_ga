from new york , and the federal bureau of investigation stated delorean was the '' financier '' to help the financially declining company in a scheme to sell , with an estimated value of us 24 million

issues affecting other chevy models , including defective motor mounts that led to an unprecedented recall of 6.7 million chevrolets built between 1965 and 1969 delorean 's lawyers successfully argued that the fbi and dea had unfairly targeted and illegally entrapped delorean when they allowed hoffman ( an active fbi informant who only knew delorean casually ) to randomly solicit delorean into a criminal conspiracy simply because he was known to be financially vulnerable this was compounded by unexpectedly lukewarm reviews from critics and the public , who generally felt the uniqueness of the
