the seat of the lords of zwijndrecht was a manor house called the kraaienhof ( the ruins of which were demolished in the mid-20th century ) , which was located in what is now the village of burcht geographically and historically , zwijndrecht and burcht were originally part of the province of east flanders , which fell under the jurisdiction of the count of flanders while very little archaeological excavation has been done in the municipality of zwijndrecht itself , numerous findings have been documented in the surrounding region , which is referred to as the waasland thoumsin military base , which houses the 11th battalion of engineers of the belgian army , is also located in burcht in spite of all efforts , belgium fell to the germans in october 1914 and burcht and zwijndrecht , like all the german-occupied communities in belgium , suffered greatly for the next four years from food shortages pastor of the church in zwijndrecht , he resisted the french occupation under the sanculottes , and died while escaping a prison camp in guyana the villages were primarily agrarian , but by the middle of the nineteenth century , burcht had become the site of heavy industry among the industries established there at the time were a guano factory , a linoleum factory , a cement factory , a pots and pans factory , and a lard processing plant however , most of the rockets missed their intended target ( the port ) and fell instead in the surrounding areas , including burcht and zwijndrecht by 1914 , the two villages were full of belgian soldiers , and orders were issued to reinforce the fort of zwijndrecht and the fort of kruibeke due to financial pressures , the heir filips ii de montmorency , count of horne ( 1524-1568 ) was forced to sell the title , property and rights to a conglomeration of four cities , brugge , gent , ieper and the brugse vrije , known as the “ vier leden ” ( four members ) by the end of the war , 80 young people from zwijndrecht and burcht had perished on the front burcht and zwijndrecht became separate villages and remained so until they were reunited as the municipality of zwijndrecht in 1977 after regaining the property , the staten van vlaanderen promptly auctioned it off to the highest bidder , an italian businessman named jacomo antonio carenna , who then became lord of zwijndrecht and burcht this situation remained until the latter half of the 11th century , when an increase in population necessitated changes in land use : the forests between settlements were cleared and fields were formed into communal agricultural spaces , using a three-course crop rotation system however , in 1923 , the two villages were transferred to the province of antwerp
