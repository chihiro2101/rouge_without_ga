the sunday of memorial day weekend is widely considered one of the most important days on the motorsports calendar , as it is the day of the indianapolis 500 , the coca-cola 600 , and ( currently ) the monaco grand prix the event is contested by '' indy cars '' , a formula of professional-level , single-seat , open cockpit , open-wheel , purpose-built race cars the race is the most prestigious event of the indycar calendar , and one of the oldest and most important automobile races from the 1970s to the 1990s , indianapolis was often the second or third race of the season , and as late as the 1950s , it was sometimes the first championship event of the year due to the high prestige of the indianapolis 500—rivaling or even surpassing the season championship—it is not uncommon for some teams and drivers to focus heavily on preparing for that race during the early part of the season , and not focus fully on the championship battle until after indy the '' indy-only '' entries , also known as '' one-offs '' , may be an extra car added to an existing full-time team , or a part-time team altogether that does not enter any of the other races , or enters only a few selected races the '' indy-only '' drivers may come from a wide range of pedigrees but are usually experienced indy car competitors that either lack a full-time ride , are former full-time drivers that have elected to drop down to part-time status , or occasional one-off drivers from other racing disciplines wilfred bourque ( kettlewell , p.1013 , mistakenly identifies him as william ) and his riding mechanic were killed after hitting a pothole in the 250 , and charlie merz 's riding mechanic , claude kellum , as well as two spectators , were killed in the 300 ; following merz 's crash , there was another serious crash , also the crowds grew progressively smaller for the rest of the season , however , so the track owners chose to focus on a single race , and considered a 24-hour contest , in the fashion of le mans , or a event the first '' 500 '' was held at the speedway in 1911 on memorial day , may 30 , ( as it was known from its inception in 1868 to 1967 , when federal law made '' memorial day '' the official name ) , run to a maximum engine size formula many considered harroun to be a hazard during the race , as he was the only driver in the race driving without a riding mechanic , who checked the oil pressure and let the driver know when traffic was coming in 1912 , the purse was raised to 50,000 , the field was limited to 33 ( where it remains ) , and a riding mechanic was made mandatory although the first race was won by an american driver at the wheel of an american car , european makers such as the italy fiat or france peugeot companies soon developed their vehicles to try to win the event , which they did from 1912 to 1919 after world war i , the native drivers and manufacturers regained their dominance of the race , and engineer harry miller set himself up as the most competitive of the post-war builders in 1946 , american operatic tenor and car enthusiast james melton started the tradition of singing '' back home again in indiana '' with the purdue band before the race when asked to do so on the spur of the moment by speedway president tony hulman in 2015 , the a cappella group straight no chaser sang the song before the race , and in the two races held after nabors ' retirement ( and before he became the regular singer ) , the singing of the song was done on a rotating basis , with the spring 2014 winner of the voice josh kaufman performing in 2016 in the early 1920s , miller built his 3.0-liter ( 183 in 3 ) engine , inspired by the peugeot grand prix engine which had been serviced in his shop by fred offenhauser in 1914 , installing it in jimmy murphy 's duesenberg and allowing him to win the 1922 edition of the race miller then created his own automobiles , which shared the 'miller ' designation , which , in turn , were powered by supercharged versions of his 2.0- and 1.5-liter ( 122 and 91 in 3 ) engine single-seaters , winning four more races for the engine up to 1929 ( two of them , 1926 and 1928 , in miller chassis ) this motor was forever connected with the brickyard 's history with a to-date record total of 27 wins , in both naturally aspirated and supercharged form , and winning a likewise record-holding 18 consecutive years between 1947 and 1964 meanwhile , european manufacturers , gone from the indianapolis 500 for nearly two decades , made a brief return just before world war ii , with the competitive maserati 8ctf allowing wilbur shaw to become the first driver to win consecutively at indianapolis , in 1939 and 1940 with the 500 having been a part of the world drivers ' championship between 1950 and 1960 , ferrari made a discreet appearance at the 1952 event with alberto ascari , but european entries were few and far between during those days racing a mid-engined car , scotland jim clark was second in his first attempt in 1963 , dominating in 1964 until suffering suspension failure on lap 47 , and completely dominating the race in 1965 , a victory which also interrupted the success of the offy , and giving the 4.2-liter ford v8 its first success at the race the offenhauser engine was also paired with a european maker , mclaren , obtaining three wins for the chassis , one with the penske team in 1972 with driver mark donohue , and two for the mclaren works team in 1974 and 1976 with johnny rutherford starting in 1978 , most chassis and engines were european , with the only american-based chassis to win during the cart era being the wildcat and galmer ( which was technically built in bicester , england ) in 1982 and 1992 , respectively however , it was not until 1993 that reigning formula one world champion nigel mansell shocked the racing world by moving to the united states , winning the cart ppg champ car championship and only losing the 500 in his rookie year because of inexperience with green-flag restarts however , from its inception , the race has been widely known as the indianapolis 500 or , more simply as '' the 500 '' following wwii , the race was commonly recognized as '' the 500 '' , '' the 500-mile race '' , '' indianapolis 500-mile race '' , '' indianapolis 500 '' , or the simple form '' indy 500 '' around that same time , in the wake of the 1979 entry controversy , and the formation of cart , the race changed to an invitational event , rather than an open , rendering the '' sweepstakes '' description inappropriate the borg-warner trophy , introduced in 1936 , proclaims the event as the '' indianapolis 500-mile race '' , with no reference at all to the name '' international sweepstakes '' in 2009 , the indianapolis motor speedway began a three-year-long '' centennial era '' to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the opening of the track ( 1909 ) , and the 100th anniversary of the first indy 500 ( 1911 ) instead , in most instances in print , television , and radio , the race was referred to as the '' 2009 indianapolis 500 '' since the race was not held during the united states ' participation in the two world wars ( 1917–1918 , 1942–1945 ) , the advertised centennial era occurred during the 93rd to 95th runnings from 1950 to 1960 , the indianapolis 500 also counted toward the fia 's world championship of drivers ( now synonymous with formula one ) , although few drivers participated in the other races of that series soon after the death of tony hulman in 1977 , and the loss of several key usac officials in a 1978 plane crash , several key team owners banded together and formed cart in late 1978 to sanction the sport of indy car racing by 1983 , an agreement was made for the usac-sanctioned indy 500 to be recognized on the cart calendar , and the race awarded points towards the cart championship in 1994 , speedway owner tony george announced plans for a new series , to be called the indy racing league , with indy 500 as its centerpiece in response to cart 's 1996 schedule that put several races in direct conflict with the first indy racing league events , george announced that 25 of the 33 starting positions at the 1996 indy 500 would be reserved for the top 25 cars in irl points standings in the 1960s and early 1970s , the indy 500 and the world 600 ( now known as the coca-cola 600 ) at charlotte motor speedway were held on different days of the week from 1994 to 2014 , several nascar drivers were able to compete in both the indy 500 and the coca-cola 600 at charlotte on the same day est to 12 noon edt—because in 1911 , race promoters estimated it would take six hours to complete the event , and they did not want the race to finish too close to dinnertime foyt also won the 24 hours of daytona and 12 hours of sebring , america 's premier endurance races , as well as the 24 hours of le mans in 2010 , chip ganassi became the first car owner to win the daytona and indianapolis 500s in the same year , with jamie mcmurray winning the daytona 500 and dario franchitti winning the indianapolis 500 ) , offered 20 million to any driver , indycar or nascar , who can win both the indianapolis 500 and the coca-cola 600 on the same day starting in 2011 , a feat that had never been accomplished for 2011 , the indianapolis motor speedway moved the start time of the indy 500 back to 12:15 pm edt ( prior to 2005 , the engines started at 10:52 am est ; under the modern schedule , engines start around 12:05 pm for a start around 12:15 pm ) , which re-opened the window for travel in the past , particularly during the era in which usac sanctioned the indy 500 ( but cart sanctioned the other indy car races ) , rules at indy slightly differed at times this was rather commonplace in the 1980s and early 1990s , when '' stock-block '' engines ( namely the v-6 buick ) was allotted an increased level of turbocharger boost by usac at indy , compared to the purpose-built v-8 quad-cam engines additionally , as the month wears on , a '' t car '' may be split off into a separate entry , and reassigned a new number , or be sold to another team during the race , work on the car is permitted , but it is usually limited to routine pit stop work ( changing tires and refueling ) and minor adjustments ( wing angles , etc '' bump day '' and '' pole day '' were moved the second day of qualifying and drivers who qualified in positions 10-30 will be locked into the field on day one at the end of the session , the fastest nine drivers advance to a ''

time to encourage local race attendance ; wrtv would air the abc primetime lineup in the afternoon in 2016 , the ims declared a sell-out of race tickets for the 100th running of the event , meaning
