it was almost certainly subjugated at a later date than that given by livy and it may have been destroyed by the latins and not by the romans ( who might have regarded the destruction of their own traditional mother-country as impious ) the alban dictator mettius fufetius betrayed rome during the war with the etruscans , where rome requested alban military assistance , which mettius agreed to , but also had a secret agreement with the etruscans to desert rome in the heat of battle , leaving tullus alone to fight the battle although that date falls well outside the traditionally-ascribed period of tullus hostilius ' reign , scholars are dubious regarding the tales of the overly-long reigns of the roman kings—with an average reign of 34 years-per-king , the traditional chronology would be without historical parallel ( the royal rulers of the remarkably stable and healthy english monarchy have an average reign of 21 years each ) it would also explain things which are otherwise puzzling : tullus 's name being attached to the building , and how , as roman traditions attest , tullus could have led rome 's successful wars against the fidenae and veii and the sabines as with those of all the early kings of rome , the events ascribed to the reign of tullus hostilius are treated with scepticism by modern historians additionally , tullus hostilius ' warlike and ferocious character seems to be little more than a contrasting stereotype to that of the peaceable , devout numa pompilius ; the first roman annalists may merely have imputed aggressive qualities to hostilius by naively parsing his gentile name ( hostilius meaning '' hostile '' in latin ) the most compelling evidence is his name : '' tullus '' is a unique praenomen in roman culture , and his gentile name is obscure and linguistically archaic enough to rule out the possibility that he was a crude later invention however , at the close of his reign , rome was affected by a series of prophecies including a shower of stones on the monte cavo ( in response to which a public religious festival of nine days was held – a novendialis ) , a loud voice was heard on the summit of the mount complaining that the albans had failed to show devotion to their former gods , and a pestilence struck in rome there are two versions concerning the death of tullus hostilius and his family , the first one consists of a myth that his house was hit by lightning and everyone with the house was killed and the house burnt to the ground with no survivors the second account is that ancus marcius and some of his followers went to tullus hostilius 's home with the intent of killing the whole family to ensure that there was no heir to the throne
