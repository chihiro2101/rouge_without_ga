in a theoretical market with perfect information , substitute good , and no transaction costs or prohibition on secondary exchange ( or re-selling ) to prevent arbitrage , price discrimination can only be a feature of monopoly and oligopoly markets , ( '' price discrimination and imperfect competition '' , lars a otherwise , the moment the seller tries to sell the same good at different prices , the buyer at the lower price can arbitrage by selling to the consumer buying at the higher price but with a tiny discount however , product heterogeneity , market frictions or high fixed costs ( which make marginal-cost pricing unsustainable in the long run ) can allow for some degree of differential pricing to different consumers , even in fully competitive retail or industrial markets price discrimination is thus very common in services where resale is not possible ; an example is student discounts at museums : in theory , students , for their condition as students , may get lower prices than the rest of the population for a certain product or service , and later will not become resellers , since what they received , may only be used or consumed by them in the market for dvds , laws require dvd players to be designed and produced with hardware or software that prevents inexpensive copying or playing of content purchased legally elsewhere in the world at a lower price for example , so-called '' premium products '' ( including relatively simple products , such as cappuccino compared to regular coffee with cream have a price differential that is not explained by the cost of production exercising first degree ( or perfect or primary ) price discrimination requires the monopoly seller of a good or service to know the absolute maximum price ( or reservation price ) that every consumer is willing to pay by knowing the reservation price , the seller is able to sell the good or service to each consumer at the maximum price they are willing to pay , and thus transform the consumer surplus into revenues , leading it to be the most profitable form of price discrimination examples of this might be observed in markets where consumers bid for tenders , though , in this case , the practice of collusive tendering could reduce the market efficiency for example , rail and tube ( subway ) travellers can be subdivided into commuter and casual travelers , and cinema goers can be subdivided into adults and children , with some theatres also offering discounts to full-time students and seniors ( some of these examples are not pure '' price discrimination '' , in that the differential price is related to production costs : the marginal cost of providing electricity or car parking spaces is very low outside peak hours airlines use several different types of price discrimination , including : bulk discounts to wholesalers , consolidators , and tour operators incentive discounts for higher sales volumes to travel agents and corporate buyers seasonal discounts , incentive discounts , and even general prices that vary by location ivan png ( managerial economics , 2nd edition , 2002 ) suggests an alternative taxonomy : ; complete discrimination : where each user purchases up to the point where the user 's marginal benefit equals the marginal cost of the item ; ; direct segmentation : where the seller can condition price on some attribute ( like age or gender ) that directly segments the buyers ; ; indirect segmentation : where the seller relies on some proxy ( e.g this surplus arises because , in a market with a single clearing price , some customers ( the very low price elasticity segment ) would have been prepared to pay more than the single market price it can be argued that strictly , a consumer surplus need not exist , for example where fixed costs or economies of scale mean that the marginal cost of adding more consumers is less than the marginal profit from selling more product an example is a high-speed internet connection shared by two consumers in a single building ; if one is willing to pay less than half the cost of connecting the building , and the other willing to make up the rest but not to pay the entire cost , then price discrimination can allow the purchase to take place it can be proved mathematically that a firm facing a downward sloping demand curve that is convex to the origin will always obtain higher revenues under price discrimination than under a single price strategy a higher price ( p1 ) is charged to the low elasticity segment , and a lower price ( p2 ) is charged to the high elasticity segment the more prices that are introduced , the greater the sum of the revenue areas , and the more of the consumer surplus is captured by the producer note that the above requires both first and second degree price discrimination : the right segment corresponds partly to different people than the left segment , partly to the same people , willing to buy more if the product is cheaper as usual , the profit maximizing output ( qt ) is determined by the intersection of the marginal cost curve ( mc ) with the marginal revenue curve for the total market ( mrt ) it is also important to note that the marginal revenue in both markets at the optimal output levels must be equal , otherwise the firm could profit from transferring output over to whichever market is offering higher marginal revenue given that market 1 has a price elasticity of demand of e 1 and market 2 of e 2 , the optimal pricing ration in market 1 versus market 2 is p_1/p_2 1+1/e_2/1+1/e_1 note that the price in a perfect competition market will always be lower than any price under price discrimination ( including in special cases like the internet connection example above , assuming that the perfectly competitive market allows consumers to pool their resources ) in a market with perfect competition , no price discrimination is possible , and the average total cost ( atc ) curve will be identical to the marginal cost curve ( mc ) price discrimination is a sign that the market is imperfect , the seller has some monopoly power , and that prices and seller profits are higher than they would be in a perfectly competitive market for example , schedule-sensitive business passengers who are willing to pay 300 for a seat from city a to city b can not purchase a 150 ticket because the 150 booking class contains a requirement for a saturday-night stay , or a 15-day advance purchase , or another fare rule that discourages , minimizes , or effectively prevents a sale to business passengers that is , the business person who purchases the 300 ticket may be willing to do so in return for a seat on a high-demand morning flight , for full refundability if the ticket is not used , and for the ability to upgrade to first class if space is available for a nominal fee on the same flight are price-sensitive passengers who are not willing to pay 300 , but who are willing to fly on a lower-demand flight ( one leaving an hour earlier ) , or via a connection city ( not a non-stop flight ) , and who are willing to forgo refundability economists such as tim harford in the undercover economist have argued that this is a form of price discrimination : by providing a choice between a regular and premium product , consumers are being asked to reveal their degree of price sensitivity ( or willingness to pay ) for comparable products if , for example , potential business class customers will pay a large price differential only if economy class seats are uncomfortable while economy class customers are more sensitive to price than comfort , airlines may have substantial incentives to purposely make economy seating uncomfortable many movie theaters , amusement parks , tourist attractions , and other places have different admission prices per market segment : typical groupings are youth/child , student , adult , senior citizen , local and foreigner gender-based price discrimination is the practice of offering identical or similar services and products to men and women at different prices when the cost of producing the products and services is the same with consumer products , differential pricing is usually not based explicitly on the actual gender of the purchaser , but is achieved implicitly by the use of differential packaging , labelling , or colour schemes designed to appeal to male or female consumers in many cases , where the product is marketed to make an attractive gift , the gender of the purchaser may be different from that of the end user the eu has banned this practice ; however , there is evidence that it is being replaced by '' proxy discrimination '' , that is , discrimination on the basis of factors that are strongly correlated with gender : for example , charging construction workers more than midwives pharmaceutical companies may charge customers living in wealthier countries a much higher price than for identical drugs in poorer nations , as is the case with the sale of antiretroviral drugs in africa sliding scale fees are when different customers are charged different prices based on their income , which is used as a proxy for their willingness or ability to pay ( wiley 2003 ) for example , airlines routinely engage in price discrimination by charging high prices for customers with relatively inelastic demand - business travelers - and discount prices for tourist who have relatively elastic demand the airlines enforce the scheme by enforcing a no resale policy on the tickets preventing a tourist from buying a ticket at a discounted price and selling it to a business traveler ( arbitrage ) while the conventional theory of price discrimination generally assumes that prices are set by the seller , there is a variant form in which prices are set by the buyer , such as in the form of pay what you want pricing such user-controlled price discrimination exploits similar ability to adapt to varying demand curves or individual price sensitivities , and may avoid the negative perceptions of price discrimination as imposed by a seller
