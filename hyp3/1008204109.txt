berman , the ideology of modern orthodoxy orthodox judaism can '' be enriched '' by its intersection with modernity ; further , '' modern society creates opportunities to be productive citizens engaged in the divine work of tikkun olam '' at the same time , in order to preserve the integrity of halakha , any area of '' powerful inconsistency and conflict '' between torah and modern culture must be filtered out here two characteristics are manifest : in general , modern orthodoxy places a high national , as well as religious , significance on the state of israel , and institutions and individuals are , typically , zionist in orientation ; relatedly , involvement with non-orthodox jews will extend beyond '' outreach '' to include institutional relations and cooperation ; see further under torah umadda other '' core beliefs '' are a recognition of the value and importance of secular studies ( see torah umadda torah and secular knowledge ) , a commitment to equality of education for both men and women , and a full acceptance of the importance of being able to financially support oneself and one 's family ( see torah im derech eretz earning a livelihood ) ; see below helmreich and reuel shinnar : modern orthodoxy in america : possibilities for a movement under siege among the issues have been the extent to which modern orthodoxy should cooperate with the more liberal denominations , support secular academic pursuits combined with religious learning , and embrace efforts to give women a larger role in jewish learning and worship ; the acceptability of modern textual criticism as a tool for torah study is also debated '' although defining themselves as '' centrist '' , institutions here include the orthodox union ( union of orthodox jewish congregations of america ) , the rabbinical council of america , and the rabbi isaac elchanan theological seminary it is also noted that many modern orthodox are '' behaviorally modern '' as opposed to '' ideologically modern '' , and , in truth , fall outside of '' modern '' orthodoxy , at least in the philosophical sense ; see below the distinction is as follows : the ideologically modern are '' meticulously observant of halakha '' , and their interaction with the secular comprises a tangible expression of their ideology , wherever it may lie on the spectrum described the '' behaviorally modern '' , on the other hand , define themselves as '' modern orthodox '' only in the sense that they are neither haredi ( '' ultra-orthodox '' ) nor conservative : these , in other words , are '' not deeply concerned with philosophical ideas '' , and , often , are not as careful in their observance this '' orthodoxy of convenience '' has maintained a certain stability over time : as long as these do n't seek to legitimize their behaviour in halakhic terms , the leadership of the ( modern ) orthodox world have no particular difficulty with them while hildesheimer 's role is not disputed—comprising distinct philosophy and pragmatic contributions—hirsch 's role is less clear , with some hirsch scholars arguing that his '' torah im derech eretz '' philosophy is in fact at odds with that of modern orthodoxy ; see further below and in the hildesheimer article hirsch 's torah im derech eretz – '' torah with the 'way of the world'/society '' ) is a philosophy of orthodox judaism that formalizes a relationship between halakhically observant judaism and the modern world shapiro , rabbi esriel hildesheimer 's program of torah u-madda his approach , '' cultured orthodoxy '' , was defined as representing '' unconditional agreement with the culture of the present day ; harmony between judaism and science ; but also unconditional steadfastness in the faith and traditions of judaism '' he was , however , '' the pragmatist rather than the philosopher '' , and it is his actions , rather than his philosophy , which have become institutionalized in modern orthodoxy , chaim i torah umadda – '' torah and secular knowledge '' ) is a philosophy concerning the secular world and judaism , and in particular secular knowledge and jewish knowledge rabbi ronnie ziegler : introduction to the philosophy of rav soloveitchik : the need for action centrist orthodoxy is the dominant mode of modern orthodoxy in the united states , while torah umadda remains closely associated with yeshiva university modern orthodoxy draws on the teachings of rabbi abraham isaac kook ( 1864–1935 ) , as well as the writings and interpretations of his son rabbi zvi yehuda kook ( 1891–1982 ) , both as regards their views on jewish peoplehood and as they regard the ( related ) interaction with the secular world '' rav kook '' saw zionism as a part of a divine scheme finally to result in the resettlement of the jewish people in its homeland , bringing salvation ( '' geula '' ) to the jewish people , and the entire world in rav kook 's thought kodesh and chol ( sacred and profane ) play an important role : kodesh is the inner taam ( reason / meaning ) of reality , while chol is that which is detached from kodesh and is without any meaning ; judaism , then , is the vehicle '' whereby we sanctify our lives , and attach all the practical , secular elements of life to spiritual goals which reflect the absolute meaning of existence – g-d himself '' rabbi hillel rachmani : introduction to the thought of rav kook in israel , the religious zionism of the dati leumi , '' national religious '' ) dominates modern orthodoxy although there is some question as how precisely to define the distinction between modern orthodoxy and haredi judaism , there is basic agreement that they may be distinguished on the basis of three major characteristics : modern orthodoxy adopts a relatively inclusive stance toward society in general , and the larger jewish community in particular modern orthodoxy is almost uniformly receptive toward israel and zionism , viewing the state of israel ( in addition to the land of israel ) as having inherent religious significance modern orthodoxy holds that strictures are not normative , rather , these are a matter of personal choice ; rabbi saul berman ( edah.org ) : diverse orthodox attitudes : chumrah '' severity and leniency are relevant only in circumstances of factual doubt , not in situations of debate or varied practice both modern orthodoxy and neo orthodoxy , the movement directly descended from hirsch 's frankfurt community , have combined torah and secular knowledge with participation in contemporary western life , and thus some maintain that there is a degree of practical and philosophical overlap between the two the role of secular life and culture : in the hirschian view , interaction with the secular and the requisite acquisition of culture and knowledge is encouraged , only insofar as it facilitates the application of torah to worldly matters for modern orthodoxy , on the other hand , secular culture and knowledge are seen as a complement to torah , and , to some extent , encouraged for their own sake some would suggest that in modern orthodoxy , judaism is enriched by interaction with modernity , whereas in neo-orthodoxy human experience ( and modernity ) are enriched by the application of torah outlook and practice priority of torah versus secular knowledge : in the hirschian view , torah is the '' sole barometer of truth '' by which to judge secular disciplines , as '' there is only one truth , and only one body of knowledge that can serve as the standard by contrast , in the view of modern orthodoxy , although torah is the '' preeminent center '' , secular knowledge is considered to offer '' a different perspective that may not agree at all with torah broader communal involvement : neo-orthodoxy , influenced by hirsch 's philosophy on austritt ( secession ) , '' could not countenance recognition of a non-believing body as a legitimate representative of the jewish people '' , and is therefore opposed to the mizrachi movement , which is affiliated with the world zionist organization and the jewish agency broadly defined , religious zionism is a movement that embraces the idea of jewish national sovereignty , often in connection with the belief in the ability of the jewish people to bring about a redemptive state through natural means , and often attributing religious significance to the modern state of israel note , however , that modern orthodoxy , in fact , overlaps to a large extent with mizrachi ( religious zionism ) ( '' throughout the world , a 'religious zionist day school ' is a synonym for a 'modern orthodox day school ' '' further , in practice , except at their extremes , the differences between religious zionism and modern orthodoxy in israel are not pronounced , and they are often identical , especially in recent years and for the younger generation . here , engagement with the secular is permissible , and encouraged , but only insofar as this benefits the state of israel ; secular knowledge ( or , at the least , an extensive secular education ) is viewed as valuable for practical ends , though not in and of itself secondly , under religious zionism , a '' nationalistic coloration '' is given to traditional religious concepts , whereas , by contrast , modern orthodoxy includes '' a greater balance which includes openness to the non-jewish world '' ; thus , under religious zionism , the jewish nation is conceived of as an '' organic unity '' , whereas modern orthodoxy emphasises the individual applying the above distinction , in israel today , modern orthodoxy—as distinct from ( right-wing ) religious zionism—is represented by only a select group of institutions : the religious kibbutz movement , ne'emanei torah va'avodah , in some areas , modern orthodoxy 's left wing appears to align with more traditional elements of conservative judaism , and in fact some on the left of modern orthodoxy have allied with the formerly conservative union for traditional judaism avraham weiss : judaism ; fall 1997 weiss argues as follows : torah mi-sinai ( '' torah from sinai '' ) : modern orthodoxy , in line with the rest of orthodoxy , holds that jewish law is divine in origin , and as such , no underlying principle may be compromised in accounting for changing political , social or economic conditions , see for example , rabbi aryeh kaplan , the rules of halacha rabbinic interpretation : ( modern ) orthodoxy contends that legal authority is cumulative , and that a contemporary posek ( decisor ) can only issue judgments based on a full history of jewish legal precedent , whereas the implicit argument of the conservative movement is that precedent provides illustrations of possible positions rather than binding law thus , although conservatism similarly holds that '' no law has authority unless it becomes part of the concern and practice of the community '' elliott n dorff : '' how conservative judaism makes decisions in jewish law halakha '' communal acceptance of a '' permissive custom '' is not '' meaningful '' , and , as a result , related rabbinic legislation can not assume the status of law in general , modern orthodoxy does not , therefore , view the process by which the conservative movement decides halakha as legitimate—or with the non-normative weighting assigned to particular halakha by the conservative movement this view is largely anecdotal , and is based on individual behaviour , as opposed to any formal , institutional position ; see above : additionally , whereas the modern orthodox position is ( generally ) presented as '' unquestioned allegiance to the primacy of torah , and that the apprehension of all other intellectual disciplines must be rooted and viewed through the prism of torah '' , haredi groups have sometimes compared modern orthodoxy with early reform judaism in germany : modern orthodox rabbis have been criticised for attempting to modify halakha , in adapting judaism to the needs of the modern world then , as now , modern orthodoxy took pains to distance its '' reforms '' , which were consistent with the shulkhan arukh and poskim , from those of the reform movement ( and the conservative movement ) , which were not the logic : since one of the characteristics of orthodoxy is the submission to the authority of oral law , the individual is expected to conform to all of its dictates , whereas modernity , by contrast , emphasizes a measure of personal autonomy as well as rationalist truth '' modern orthodoxy '' , then , as opposed to constituting an ideological spectrum centred on a common core of values , is , in fact , ( tending towards ) several entirely separate movements shalom carmy – professor of jewish studies and philosophy at yeshiva university ;
