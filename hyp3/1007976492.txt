with support from the spartan lampito , lysistrata persuades the other women to withhold sexual privileges from their menfolk as a means of forcing them to conclude the peloponnesian war it is a long and detailed oath , in which the women abjure all their sexual pleasures , including the lioness on the cheese grater ( a sexual position ) soon after the oath is finished , a cry of triumph is heard from the nearby acropolis—the old women of athens have seized control of it at lysistrata 's instigation , since it holds the state treasury , without which the men can not long continue to fund their war he reflects on the hysterical nature of women , their devotion to wine , promiscuous sex , and exotic cults ( such as to sabazius and adonis ) , but above all he blames men for poor supervision of their womenfolk the debate or agon is continued between the chorus of old men and the chorus of old women until lysistrata returns to the stage with some news—her comrades are desperate for sex and they are beginning to desert on the silliest pretexts ( for example , one woman says she has to go home to air her fabrics by spreading them on the bed ) all sing a merry song in praise of athene , goddess of wisdom and chastity , whose citadel provided a refuge for the women during the events of the comedy , and whose implied blessing has brought about a happy ending to the play its protagonist , a sausage-seller named agoracritus , emerges at the end of the play as the improbable saviour of athens ( lysistrata is its saviour thirteen years later ) the peace of nicias was formalised this same year , ending the first half of the peloponnesian war ( referred to in lysistrata as '' the former war '' ) s : el : λυσιστράτη line 507 413 bc : the athenians and their allies suffered a catastrophic defeat in the sicilian expedition , a turning-point in the long-running peloponnesian war s : el : λυσιστράτη line 558 hermokopidae : vandals who mutilated the herma in athens at the onset of the sicilian expedition , they are mentioned in the play as a reason why the peace delegates should not remove their cloaks , in case they too are vandalized s : el : λυσιστράτη line 1094 hippias : an athenian tyrant , he receives two mentions in the play , as a sample of the kind of tyranny that the old men can '' smell '' in the revolt by the women lysistrata line 619 and secondly in connection with a good service that the spartans once rendered athens ( they removed him from power by force ) s : el : λυσιστράτη line 1153 aristogeiton : a famous tyrannicide , he is mentioned briefly here with approval by the old men s : el : λυσιστράτη lines1138-44 myronides : an athenian general in the 450s , he is mentioned by the old men as a good example of a hairy guy , together with phormio , the athenian admiral who swept the spartans from the sea between 430 and 428 bc s : el : λυσιστράτη line 489-91 he was previously mentioned in peace peace lines 395 and the birds the birds line 1556 demostratus : an athenian who proposed and carried the motion in support of the sicilian expedition , he is mentioned briefly by the magistrate s : el : λυσιστράτη lines 391-93 cleisthenes : a notoriously effete homosexual and the butt of many jokes in old comedy , he receives two mentions here , firstly as a suspected mediator between the spartans and the athenian women s : el : λυσιστράτη line 621 and secondly as someone that sex-starved athenian men are beginning to consider a viable proposition birds lines 822 , 1127 , 1295 lycon : a minor politician who afterwards figured significantly in the trial of socrates , s : apology ( plato ) 29 section 29 he is mentioned here merely as the husband of a woman that the old men have a particular dislike for s : el : λυσιστράτη line 270 ( he is mentioned also in the wasps ) s : el : λυσιστράτη lines 1247–61 artemisia : a female ruler of ionia , famous for her participation in the naval battle of salamis , she is mentioned by the old men with awe s : el : λυσιστράτη line 675 as a kind of amazon homer : the epic poet is quoted in a circuitous manner when lysistrata quotes her husband s : el : λυσιστράτη line 520 who quotes from a speech by hector in the iliad as he farewells his wife before going to battle : '' war will be men 's business '' iliad book 6 , line 492 aeschylus : the tragic poet is mentioned briefly s : el : λυσιστράτη line 188 as the source of a ferocious oath that lysistrata proposes to her comrades , in which a shield is to be filled with blood ; the oath is found in aeschylus ' seven against thebes s : el : λυσιστράτη line 361 micon : an artist , he is mentioned briefly by the old men in reference to amazons s : el : λυσιστράτη line 679 ( because he depicted a battle between theseus and amazons on the painted stoa ) timon : the legendary misanthrope , he is mentioned here with approval by the old women in response to the old men 's favourable mention of melanion , a legendary misogynist s : el : λυσιστράτη lines 785–820 orsilochus and pellene : an athenian pimp and a prostitute , a even when they seemed to demonstrate empathy with the female condition , dramatic poets in classical athens still reinforced sexual stereotyping of women as irrational creatures in need of protection from themselves and from others 215 in fact the play might not even be a plea for an end to the war so much as an imaginative vision of an honorable end to the war at a time when no such ending was possible such variations from convention include : the divided chorus : the chorus begins this play being divided ( old men versus old women ) , and its unification later exemplifies the major theme of the play : reconciliation a doubling of the role of the chorus occurs in two other middle-period plays , the frogs and thesmophoriazusae , but in each of those plays the two choruses appear consecutively and not simultaneously most plays have a second parabasis near the end and there is something like a parabasis in that position in this play but it comprises only two songs ( strophe and antistrophe ) and these are separated by an episodic scene of dialogue lysistrata wikisource original greek lines 1043–71 and 1189–1215 in these two songs , the now united chorus declares that it is not prepared to speak ill of anyone on this occasion because the current situation ( ta parakeímena ) is already bad enough—topical reference to the catastrophic end to the sicilian expedition agon : the roman orator quintilian considered old comedy a good genre for study by students of rhetoric quintilian , orator 's training 10.1.65-66 , cited in the birds and other plays by aristophanes , ed in the first half of the agon , lysistrata quotes from homer 's iliad ( '' war will be men 's business '' ) , then quotes 'the man in the street ' ( '' is n't there a man in the country ? '' — '' no , by god , there is n't ! '' ) and finally arrives at the only logical conclusion to these premises : '' war will be women 's business ! '' the logic of this conclusion is supported rhythmically by the pnigos , during which lysistrata and her friends dress the magistrate like a woman , with a veil and a basket of wool , reinforcing her argument and lending it ironic point—if the men are women , obviously the war can only be women 's business 1934 : new york literary entrepreneur george macey , who founded the limited editions club in 1929 ( an imprint specializing in commissioning some of the era 's best-known artists to illustrate literary classics in limited editions of 1,500 signed copies , sold to members on a subscription basis ) commissioned pablo picasso to illustrate a special edition of aristophanes 's lysistrata , a new version written by gilbert seldes , containing six etchings and thirty four line block reproductions after drawings 1972 : the '' edwina '' episode of m a s h uses the device of a sexual strike by the nurses , to get one man to date the unusually clumsy edwina ; the nurses ' organized withholding of sexuality was somewhat reminiscent of lysistrata , though the play is not explicitly referenced 1985 : david brin 's post-apocalyptic novel the postman , which had themes of duty , war , peace , and gender roles , is dedicated : '' to benjamin franklin , devious genius , and to lysistrata , who tried '' lucy and her fellow new yorkers cleo and cookie called all of the wives , girlfriends , and lovers of the men controlling the most powerful countries to engage the women in a sex boycott to bring the men into line sommerstein , prose and verse : available for digital loan 1988 , jeffrey henderson , verse 1991 , nicholas rudall 2000 , george theodoridis , 2000 , prose 2002 , david landon , prose and verse 2003 , sarah ruden 2004 , paul roche , verse and prose 2005 , edward einhorn , prose and verse 2003/06 , chris tilley , musical version with prose and songs 2008 , ian c johnston , verse 2010 , david stuttard , prose and verse stuttard , david , looking at lysistrata : eight essays and a new version of aristophanes ' provocative comedy ( duckworth 2010 ) anonymous translator , prose
