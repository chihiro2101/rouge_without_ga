in 1876 , james starley developed the coventry lever tricycle , which used two small wheels on the right side and a large drive wheel on the left side ; power was supplied by hand levers '' the first front steering tricycle was manufactured in 1881 by the leicester safety tricycle company of leicester , england , which was brought to the market in 1882 costing Â£18 rear wheel steering is sometimes used , although this increases the turning circle and can affect handling ( the geometry is similar to a regular tricycle operating in reverse , but with a steering damper added ) upright resembles a two-wheeled bicycle , traditionally diamond frame , or open frame , but with either two widely spaced wheels at the back ( called delta ) or two wheels at the front ( called tadpole ) steering is through a handlebar directly connected to the front wheel via a conventional bicycle fork in delta , or via a form of ackermann steering geometry in the case of the upright tadpole all non-tilting trikes have stability issues and great care must be used when riding a non tilting upright trike recumbent trikes ' advantages ( over conventional trikes ) include stability ( through low centre of gravity ) and low aerodynamic drag recumbent delta is similar to an upright , with two wheels at the back and one at the front , but has a recumbent layout in which the rider is seated in a chair-like seat steering is either through a linkage , with the handlebars under the seat ( under seat steering ) or directly to the front wheel with a large handlebar ( over seat steering ) the weight of a delta trike can be quite close to the weight of a tadpole trike if they are both of a similar quality and similar materials are used steering is either through a single handlebar linked with tie rods to the front wheels ' stub axle assemblies ( indirect ) or with two handlebars ( rather , two half-handlebars ) each bolted to a steerer tube , usually through a bicycle-type headset and connected to a stub axle assembly ( direct ) with its extremely low center of gravity , aerodynamic layout and light weight ( for trikes ) , tadpoles are considered the highest performance trikes the hand-power only trikes can be used by individuals who do not have the use of their legs due to a disability or an injury most cycle rickshaws , used for carrying passengers for hire , are tricycles with one steering wheel in the front and two wheels in the back supporting a seating area for one or two passengers in the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century , rickshaws became increasingly popular in big cities in britain , europe and the united states , where they provide urban transportation , novelty rides , and serve as advertising media the trike pictured is called the suv ( sensible utility vehicle ) and is produced by the company organic engines , which operates in florida in the united states these are usually mounted over one or both wheels , low behind the front wheel , or between parallel wheels at either the front or rear of the vehicle , to keep the center of gravity low many , but not all , cycles used for the purpose of vending goods such as ice cream cart trikes or hot dog vending trikes are cargo bicycles common uses include : delivery services in dense urban environments food vending in high foot traffic areas ( including specialist ice cream bikes ) transporting trade tools , including around large installations such as power stations and cern airport cargo handling recycling collections warehouse inventory transportation mail food collection child transport ( in amsterdam , freight trikes are used primarily to carry children ) tricycles are typically used by children between the ages of two and five , after which point they usually switch to a bicycle , often with training wheels ( stabilisers ) children 's trikes can have pedals directly driving the front wheels , allowing braking with the pedals , or they can use chain drive the rear wheels , often without a differential , so one rear wheel spins free with hand and foot trikes , the rider makes a pair of front wheels change directions by shifting the center of weight and moves forward by rotating the rear wheel tricycles have been constructed that tilt in the direction of a turn , as a bicycle does , to avoid rolling over without a wide axle track in the case of delta tricycles , the drive is often to just one of the rear wheels , though in some cases both wheels are driven through a differential some trikes use a geometry ( also called center point steering ) with the kingpin axis intersecting the ground directly ahead of the tire contact point , producing a normal amount of trail while the kmx kart stunt trike with this setup allows the rear brake to be operated separately , letting the rider do '' bootlegger turns '' , the standard setup for most trikes has the front brake for each side operated by each hand
