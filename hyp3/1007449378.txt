3-4 as an important break with descartes , sartre rejects the primacy of knowledge ( a rejection summed up in the phrase '' existence precedes essence '' ) and offers a different conception of knowledge and consciousness for sartre , intentionality implies that there is no form of self that is hidden inside consciousness ( such as husserl 's transcendental ego ) in the introduction , sartre sketches his own theory of consciousness , being , and phenomena through criticism of both earlier phenomenologists ( most notably husserl and heidegger ) as well as idealism , rationalism , and empiricism according to him , one of the major achievements of modern philosophy is phenomenology because it disproved the kinds of dualism that set the existent up as having a '' hidden '' nature ( such as immanuel kant 's noumenon ) ; phenomenology has removed '' the illusion of worlds behind the scene '' in the first chapter , sartre develops a theory of nothingness which is central to the whole book , especially to his account for bad faith and freedom 58 in the totality of consciousness and phenomenon ( heidegger 's being-in-the-world ) , both can be considered separately , but exist only as a whole ( intentionality of consciousness ) living a life defined by one 's occupation , social , racial , or economic class , is the very essence of '' bad faith '' , the condition in which people can not transcend their situations in order to realize what they must be ( human ) and what they are not ( waiter , grocer , etc an example of projection that sartre uses is the café waiter who performs the duties , traditions , functions , and expectations of a café waiter : sartre also gives , as an example of bad faith , the attitude of the homosexual who denies that he is a homosexual , feeling that '' a homosexual is not a homosexual '' in the same sense that a table is a table or a red-haired man is red-haired sartre argues that such an attitude is partially correct since it is based in the '' irreducible character of human reality '' , but that it would be fully correct only if the homosexual accepted that he is a homosexual in the sense that he has adopted a pattern of conduct defined as that of a homosexual , although not one '' to the extent that human reality can not be finally defined by patterns of conduct '' sartre consistently mentions that in order to get out of bad faith , one must realize that one 's existence and one 's formal projection of a self are distinctly separate and within the means of human control nothingness , in terms of bad faith , is characterized by sartre as the internal negation which separates pure existence and identity , and thus we are subject to playing our lives out in a similar manner to live and project into the future as a project of a self , while keeping out of bad faith and living by the will of the self is living life authentically sartre essentially characterizes this as '' the faith of bad faith '' which is and should not be , in sartre 's opinion , at the heart of one 's existence sartre believes that it is often created as a means of making the unbearable anguish of a person 's relationship to their '' facticity '' ( all of the concrete details against the background of which human freedom exists and is limited , such as birthplace and time ) bearable '' even in sex ( perhaps especially in sex ) , men and women are haunted by a state in which consciousness and bodily being would be in perfect harmony , with desire satisfied there will be , for sartre , no such moment of completion because '' man is a useless passion '' to be the ens causa sui , the god of the ontological proof sartre contends that human existence is a conundrum whereby each of us exists , for as long as we live , within an overall condition of nothingness ( no thing-ness ) —that ultimately allows for free consciousness this leads to failed dreams of completion , as sartre described them , because inevitably we are unable to bridge the void between the purity and spontaneity of thought and all-too constraining action ; between the being and the nothingness that inherently coincide in our self this is accomplished by rigorously forcing order onto nothingness , employing the '' spirit ( or consciousness of mind ) of seriousness '' and describing the failure to do so in terms such as '' bad faith '' and '' false consciousness '' though sartre 's conclusion seems to be that being diminishes before nothingness since consciousness is probably based more on spontaneity than on stable seriousness , he contends that any person of a serious nature is obliged to continuous struggle between two things : : a ) the conscious desire for peaceful self-fulfillment through physical actions and social roles—as if living within a portrait that one actively paints of oneself : b ) the more pure and raging spontaneity of no thing consciousness , of being instantaneously free to overturn one 's roles , pull up stakes , and strike out on new paths , one 's '' ego '' ) , but rather that , as a phenomenon in the world , consciousness both appears and appears to itself at the same time by appearing to itself , sartre argues that consciousness is fully transparent ; unlike an ordinary '' object '' ( a house , for instance , of which it is impossible to perceive all of the sides at the same time ) , consciousness '' sees '' all aspects of itself at once sartre offers a critique of the psychoanalyst sigmund freud 's theory of the unconscious , based on the claim that consciousness is essentially self-conscious toward the end of being and nothingness , sartre attempts to adapt some of freud 's ideas , and thereby develop an '' existential psychoanalysis '' in which causal categories are replaced by teleological categories explanation of terms based on appendix to the english edition of being and nothingness by translator hazel barnes being ( être ) : including both being-in-itself and being-for-itself ( both as defined below ) , but the latter is the nihilation of the former sartre states that '' consciousness is a being such that in its being , its being is in question insofar as this being implies a being other than itself reflection ( reflet ) : the form in which the for-itself founds its own nothingness through the dyad of '' the-reflection-reflecting '' reflection ( réflexion ) : the consciousness attempting to become its own object being and nothingness is considered sartre 's most important philosophical work , and the most important non-fiction expression of his existentialism while marcel noted the influence of heidegger on '' the form at least '' of being and nothingness , he also observed that sartre diverged from the views expressed by heidegger in being and time ( 1927 ) in important ways , and that sartre 's contributions were original marcel considered sartre 's analysis of bad faith '' one of the most outstanding and solid '' parts of being and nothingness , writing that it prevented sartre 's arguments from being purely abstract marcel saw one of the most important merits of the work to be to show '' that a form of metaphysics which denies or refuses grace inevitably ends by setting up in front of us the image of an atrophied and contradictory world where the better part of ourselves is finally unable to recognise itself he criticized sartre for neglecting heidegger 's '' notion of the truth of being '' , his understanding of what it means for a subject or object to be in his view , sartre failed to '' deal with the problem of truth in a radical and existential way '' , instead viewing truth in '' the ordinary intellectualistic sense that has been traditional with non-existential philosophers '' and thereby remaining a cartesian rationalist according to the philosopher steven crowell , being and nothingness had come to be seen as outdated by sartre 's death in 1980 , since its emphasis on consciousness associated with '' the subjectivism and psychologism that structuralism and analytic philosophy had finally laid to rest he wrote that sartre 's argument that freud 's theory of repression is internally flawed is based on a misunderstanding of freud , and that sartre 's attempts to adapt freud 's ideas are of greater interest several authors , including the sociologist murray s , davis , the philosophers roger scruton and maxine sheets-johnstone , and the physician frank gonzalez-crussi , have praised sartre for his contributions to the philosophy of sex naomi greene , arguing that there is a '' distaste for sexuality '' in sartre 's work , identifies a clear '' anti-sexual bias '' present in being and nothingness being and nothingness : an essay in phenomenological ontology , by jean-paul sartre , citadel press , 2001 class lecture notes on sartre 's being and nothingness by professor spade at indiana university
