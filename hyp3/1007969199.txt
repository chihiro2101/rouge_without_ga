for example , in hornblower and the hotspur , he contrives an escape for his personal steward , who would otherwise have to be hanged for striking a superior officer due to his exploits , hornblower is made commander , but his promotion is not confirmed when he returns to england following the announcement of the peace of amiens , causing him great financial distress : he has to make up the difference between a commander 's pay and a lieutenant 's , all from his half-pay while inactive '' when hornblower arrives home , he discovers that his first wife maria has died in childbirth , but the baby boy survived and lady barbara ( now widowed after admiral leighton died of wounds sustained during the attack on rosas hornblower had observed as a prisoner ) has taken charge of the child , with her brothers lords wellesley and wellington as godfathers an episode of the american tv series alcoa premiere , hornblower ( 1963 ) starring david buck in the title role was based on lord hornblower the itv and a & e television series hornblower ( 1998–2003 ) starred ioan gruffudd as hornblower , and included stories from mr in dewey lambdin 's king , ship , and sword , the main character alan lewrie ( another fictional british captain of the era ) makes a visit to the admiralty and takes particular note of a tall , thin lieutenant in a threadbare uniform with a melancholy expression they include : jonathan hornblower ( 1717 ) and jonathan hornblower junior , noted engineers who designed and worked with steam engines in cornish mines in the late 18th century josiah hornblower , an engineer who moved to america and became speaker of the new england assembly jabez carter hornblower , son of jonathan junior and another engineer likewise , forester disregarded the strict royal navy practice of only promoting officers based on seniority as post-captain ; hornblower becomes a post-captain in 1805 , is a rear admiral before napoleon 's death in may 1821 , and is admiral of the fleet in 1848 before napoleon iii took power in france while the lieutenant 's name is never mentioned , he displays several of hornblower 's best known characteristics , and the state of a penniless lieutenant fits with the events at the end of lieutenant hornblower ( this scene takes place during the peace of amiens ) hornblower also takes on an important passenger in panama—lady barbara wellesley , the fictional younger sister of arthur wellesley ( later to become the duke of wellington ) —also hornblower 's future wife and the love of his life in the fictional setting of the league of extraordinary gentlemen by alan moore , hornblower is the equivalent of lord nelson , with the black dossier ( 2007 ) depicting nelson 's column as one of london 's most popular landmarks there , he recaptures a royal navy cutter , the witch of endor , mans the vessel with a commandeered gang of slave labourers , and escapes to the channel fleet despite this unfortunate beginning , however , he warms to her over the course of several books , and becomes a good ( though not perfect ) husband to her and father to their two children , also named horatio and maria at the end of his long and heroic career , he is wealthy , famous and contented , a loving and beloved , indulgent husband and father , and finally free of the insecurities and self-loathing that had driven him throughout his life hornblower is courageous , intelligent , and a skilled seaman , but he is also burdened by his intense reserve , introspection , and self-doubt , and is described as '' unhappy and lonely '' when he finds that the spanish have switched sides in the interim , he is forced to find and sink the ship he had captured—adding injury to insult , as he had given up a fortune in prize money to maintain the uneasy alliance with the madman he is guarded with nearly everyone , unless the matter is the business of discharging his duty as a king 's officer , in which case he is clear and decisive when he is approached by a french official willing to negotiate the surrender of a major port , he seizes the opportunity and engineers the return of the bourbons to france while waiting at his mediterranean rendezvous point for the rest of his squadron—and its commander—to arrive , he carries out a series of raids against the french along the south coast of spain , earning himself the nickname '' the terror of the mediterranean '' midshipman hornblower , he made his hero about five years younger , giving his birth date as 4 july 1776 ( the date of the adoption of the united states declaration of independence ) like hornblower , harrington comes from a modest background , lacking patronage of any sort , and throughout the series accrues promotions , peerages , and other honours , rising to the rank of admiral he captures natividad , a much more powerful spanish ship ( bush refers to it as a '' ship of the line '' , although hornblower believes this is stretching a point ) , but then has to cede it reluctantly to el supremo to placate him he is given a classics , and by the time he joins the royal navy at age seventeen , he is well-versed in greek and latin at the same time , forester wrote the body of the works carefully to avoid entanglements with real world history , so hornblower is always off on another mission when a great naval victory occurs during the napoleonic wars the popular richard sharpe novels by bernard cornwell were inspired by the hornblower series ; cornwell avidly read the series as a child , and was disappointed to learn that there was no similar series chronicling the napoleonic wars on land he regards himself as cowardly , dishonest , and , at times , disloyal—never crediting his ability to persevere , think rapidly , organise , or cut to the heart of a matter when napoleon returns from exile at the start of the hundred days , hornblower is staying at the estate of the comte de graçay , which he was visiting after again growing tired of his life in smallbridge after a winter sojourn at the chateau of the comte de graçay , during which he has an affair with the nobleman 's widowed daughter-in-law , the escapees travel down the loire river to the coastal city of nantes there are other discrepancies as well ; in one account of his defeat of a spanish frigate in the mediterranean , he distinguished himself as lieutenant and in another he is a post-captain with less than three years seniority as a junior lieutenant , he serves in hms renown under captain sawyer , whose bouts of paranoia on a mission to the caribbean strain discipline to breaking point northcote parkinson in his '' biography '' called the true story of horatio hornblower gives slight scholarly corrections to various aspects of hornblower 's life as narrated by his creator
