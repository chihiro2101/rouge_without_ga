he described george washington as a '' high-flying aristocrat '' , and he found the aristocracy of money and achievement in america still less to his liking than the european aristocracy of birth a commission was given him as adjutant-general in the french army , which he hoped might protect him from the penalty of treason in the event of capture by the british ; though he himself claimed the authorship of a proclamation said to have been issued by the united irishmen , enjoining that all irishmen taken with arms in their hands in the british service should be instantly shot ; and he supported a project for landing la legion noire in england , who were to burn bristol a sympathizer wrote of him , in french , saying : wolf tone was sent to france to claim the support of the directory , under the express condition that the french should come to ireland as allies , and should act under direction of the new government , as rochambeau had done in america in ireland the membership of the united irish had reached 300,000 , about 6 % of the population , but a vicious counter-insurgency campaign in 1797 weakened the organisation and forced the leadership to launch a rising without french aid napoleon bonaparte , with whom tone had several interviews at this time , was less disposed than hoche had been to undertake in earnest an irish expedition ; and when the rising broke out in ireland in 1798 he had started for egypt one of these under general humbert succeeded in landing a force near killala , county mayo , and gained some success in connacht ( particularly at castlebar ) before it was subdued by general lake and charles cornwallis wolfe tone 's brother matthew was captured , tried by court-martial , and hanged ; a second raid , accompanied by napper tandy , came to disaster on the coast of donegal ; while wolfe tone took part in a third , under admiral jean-baptiste-françois bompart , with general jean hardy in command of a force of about 3,000 men ii , p1829 at his trial by court-martial in dublin on 8 november 1798 tone made a speech avowing his determined hostility to england and his intention '' by frank and open war to procure the separation of the countries '' reading from a prepared speech , he defended his view of a military separation from britain ( as had occurred in the fledgeling united states ) , he explained his motives : a commentary on the trial continues : '' after a long silence , interrupted by some expressions of admiration , he was told that his request should be submitted to the lord-lieutenant he was the prime mover of it , and was its last victim… '' the criminal history of the english government from the first massacre of the irish , to the poisoning of the chinese , translated from the french , with notes by an american he also lamented the outbreak of mass violence , saying : '' such are my principles such has been my conduct ; if in consequence of the measures in which i have been engaged misfortunes have been brought upon this country , i heartily lament it , but let it be remembered that it is now nearly four years since i have quit ireland and consequently i have been personally concerned in none of them ; if i am rightly informed very great atrocities have been committed on both sides , but that does not at all diminish my regret ; for a fair and open war i was prepared ; if that has degenerated into a system of assassination , massacre , and plunder i do again most sincerely lament it , and those few who know me personally will give me i am sure credit for the assertion the story goes that he was initially saved when the wound was sealed with a bandage , and he was told if he tried to talk the wound would open and he would bleed to death theobald wolfe tone died on 19 november 1798 at the age of 35 in provost 's prison , dublin , not far from where he was born this was a remarkable act , given that the rebellion had just occurred with great loss of life , and one that could never be enlarged upon as kilwarden was killed at the beginning of emmet 's revolt in 1803 as a pillar of the protestant ascendancy and , as attorney-general for ireland the prosecutor of the case against united irishman william orr , kilwarden had no other obvious motive for trying to assist tone in 1795 and 1798 stewart has commented ( 2001 ) on tone 's long obsession with the heroism and death in battle of james wolfe in 1759 , seeing him as a cousin to be emulated '' tone rises '' , said william lecky , the 19th-century historian , '' far above the dreary level of commonplace which irish conspiracy in general presents… his judgement of men and things was keen , lucid and masculine , and he was alike prompt in decision and brave in action '' history of ireland in the eighteenth centuryvol 5 , by weh lecky , longmans , greens and co ( london ) , p79 ( cabinet ed , 5 vols , london , 1892 ) his journals , which were written for his family and intimate friends were published in washington dc in 1821 by his son , william theobald wolfe tone modern republicans quote his ideals : in 1898 a series of centenary commemorations of the 1798 rebellion were held by the nationalist irish parliamentary party , the irish republican brotherhood and the catholic church in ireland , that to a large extent sidelined tone and the other protestant nationalist leaders after the defeat of napoleon at the battle of waterloo , he emigrated to the united states , where he was commissioned a captain in the united states army and died there on 11 october 1828 at the age of 37 several streets , plazas and a bridge have been named in honour of tone , including wolfe tone square in dublin and wolfe tone bridge over the river corrib in galway city ) , the writings of theobald wolfe tone 1763–98 , volume i : tone 's career in ireland to june 1795 ( oxford : oxford university press , 1998 ) ) , the writings of theobald wolfe tone 1763–98 , volume ii : america , france , and bantry bay , august 1795 to december 1796 ( oxford : oxford university press , 2001 ) ) , the writings of theobald wolfe tone 1763–98 , volume iii : france , the rhine , lough swilly and death of tone , january 1797 to november 1798 ( oxford : oxford university press , 2007 ) irishkevinsmith.com cork-guide.ie chaptersofdoublin.com memoirs by jonah barrington ( 1828 ) the year of the french by thomas flanagan '' a rough guide to revolutionary paris : wolfe tone as an accidental tourist '' , by sylvie kleinman , in history ireland 16:2 ( 2008 ) 34–39 '' ambassador incognito and accidental tourist : cultural perspectives on theobald wolfe tone 's mission to france , 1796-8 '' , by sylvie kleinman , in michael brown and rosalyn trigger ( eds ) , journal of irish and scottish studies , 'the auld alliance : irish & scottish connections with france since 1500 ' , volume 2 : issue 1 , september 2008 ( university of aberdeen ) , pp101–122
