in 1886 , adolf mayer first described the tobacco mosaic disease that could be transferred between plants , similar to bacterial infections in 1892 , dmitri ivanovsky gave the first concrete evidence for the existence of a non-bacterial infectious agent , showing that infected sap remained infectious even after filtering through the finest chamberland filters later , in 1903 , ivanovsky published a paper describing abnormal crystal intracellular inclusions in the host cells of the affected tobacco plants and argued the connection between these inclusions and the infectious agent however , ivanovsky remained rather convinced , despite repeated failures to produce evidence , that the causal agent was an unculturable bacterium , too small to be retained on the employed chamberland filters and to be detected in the light microscope in 1898 , martinus beijerinck independently replicated ivanovsky 's filtration experiments and then showed that the infectious agent was able to reproduce and multiply in the host cells of the tobacco plant paul , minnesota ) beijerinck coined the term of '' virus '' to indicate that the causal agent of tobacco mosaic disease was of non-bacterial nature for his work , he was awarded 1/4 of the nobel prize in chemistry in 1946 , even though it was later shown some of his conclusions ( in particular , that the crystals were pure protein , and assembled by autocatalysis ) were incorrect in 1955 , heinz fraenkel-conrat and robley williams showed that purified tmv rna and its capsid ( coat ) protein assemble by themselves to functional viruses , indicating that this is the most stable structure ( the one with the lowest free energy ) in 1958 , she speculated that the virus was hollow , not solid , and hypothesized that the rna of tmv is single-stranded the 4 genes encode a replicase ( with methyltransferase mt and rna helicase hel domains ) , an rna-dependent rna polymerase , a so-called movement protein ( mp ) and a capsid ( cp ) rather , it will over-winter in infected tobacco stalks and leaves in the soil , on the surface of contaminated seed ( tmv can even survive in contaminated tobacco products for many years ) with the direct contact with host plants through its vectors ( normally insects such as aphids and leafhoppers ) , tmv will go through the infection process and then the replication process although tmv does not have defined transmission vectors , the virus can be easily transmitted from the infected hosts to the healthy plants , by human handling it is known to infect members of nine plant families , and at least 125 individual species , including tobacco , tomato , pepper ( all members of the useful solanaceae ) , cucumbers , a number of ornamental flowers , and beans including phaseolus vulgaris and vigna unguiculata furthermore , the cross protection method can be administered , where the stronger strain of tmv infection is inhibited by infecting the host plant with mild strain of tmv , similar to the effect of a vaccine in the past ten years , the application of genetic engineering on a host plant genome has been developed to allow the host plant to produce the tmv coat protein within their cells it was hypothesized that the tmv genome will be re-coated rapidly upon entering the host cell , thus it prevents the initiation of tmv replication
