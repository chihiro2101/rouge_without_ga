non-associative learning refers to '' a relatively permanent change in the strength of response to a single stimulus due to repeated exposure to that stimulus habituation is an example of non-associative learning in which one or more components of an innate response ( e.g an example of habituation can be seen in small song birds—if a stuffed owl ( or similar predator ) is put into the cage , the birds initially react to it as though it were a real predator if another stuffed owl is introduced ( or the same one removed and re-introduced ) , the birds react to it again as though it were a predator , demonstrating that it is only a very specific stimulus that is habituated to ( namely , one particular unmoving owl in one place ) the habituation process is faster for stimuli that occur at a high rather than for stimuli that occur at a low rate as well as for the weak and strong stimuli , respectively sensitization is an example of non-associative learning in which the progressive amplification of a response follows repeated administrations of a stimulus ( bell et al this is based on the notion that a defensive reflex to a stimulus such as withdrawal or escape becomes stronger after the exposure to a different harmful or threatening stimulus since understanding information is the key aspect of learning , it is important for learners to recognize what they understand and what they do not in operant conditioning , a behavior that is reinforced or punished in the presence of a stimulus becomes more or less likely to occur in the presence of that stimulus in operant conditioning , a reinforcement ( by reward ) or instead a punishment is given after a given behavior , changing the frequency and/or form of that behavior the typical paradigm for classical conditioning involves repeatedly pairing an unconditioned stimulus ( which unfailingly evokes a reflexive response ) with another previously neutral stimulus ( which does not normally evoke the response ) following conditioning , the response occurs both to the unconditioned stimulus and to the other , unrelated stimulus ( now referred to as the '' conditioned stimulus '' ) the first time pavlov rang the bell , the neutral stimulus , the dogs did not salivate , but once he put the meat powder in their mouths they began to salivate in 1913 , watson published the article '' psychology as the behaviorist views , '' in which he argued that laboratory studies should serve psychology best as a science watson 's most famous , and controversial , experiment was '' little albert '' , where he demonstrated how psychologists can account for the learning of emotion through classical conditioning principles in humans , this form of learning seems to not need reinforcement to occur , but instead , requires a social model such as a parent , sibling , friend , or teacher with surroundings imprinting is a kind of learning occurring at a particular life stage that is rapid and apparently independent of the consequences of behavior in filial imprinting , young animals , particularly birds , form an association with another individual or in some cases , an object , that they respond to as they would to a parent play , as it pertains to humans as a form of learning is central to a child 's learning and development as a form of learning , play also facilitates the development of thinking and language skills in children there are five types of play : sensorimotor play aka functional play , characterized by the repetition of an activity roleplay occurs starting at the age of 3 rule-based play where authoritative prescribed codes of conduct are primary construction play involves experimentation and building movement play aka physical play these five types of play are often intersecting enculturation is the process by which people learn values and behaviors that are appropriate or necessary in their surrounding culture episodic learning is so named because events are recorded into episodic memory , which is one of the three forms of explicit learning and retrieval , along with perceptual memory and semantic memory episodic memory remembers events and history that are embedded in experience and this is distinguished from semantic memory , which attempts to extract facts out of their experiential context or – as some describe – a timeless organization of knowledge london and new york : routledge contented that structure and interaction or dialogue bridge the gap in understanding and communication that is created by geographical distances ( known as transactional distance ) the major technique used for rote learning is learning by repetition , based on the idea that a learner can recall the material exactly ( but not its meaning ) if the information is repeatedly processed meaningful learning , on the other hand , implies there is a comprehensive knowledge of the context of the facts learned image : laurentius de voltolina 001.jpg right 225px thumb a depiction of the world 's oldest continually operating university , the university of bologna , italy formal learning is learning that takes place within a teacher-student relationship , such as in a school system the term formal learning has nothing to do with the formality of the learning , but rather the way it is directed and organized for example , learning by coming together with people with similar interests and exchanging viewpoints , in clubs or in ( international ) youth organizations , workshops it may occur through the experience of day-to-day situations ( for example , one would learn to look ahead while walking because of the danger inherent in not paying attention to where one is going ) they may be given time to assist international youth workshops and training courses , on the condition they prepare , contribute , share , and can prove this offered valuable new insight , helped to acquire new skills , a place to get experience in organizing , teaching , etc to learn a skill , such as solving a rubik 's cube quickly , several factors come into play at once : reading directions helps a player learn the patterns that solve the rubik 's cube tangential learning is the process by which people self-educate if a topic is exposed to them in a context that they already enjoy for example , after playing a music-based video game , some people may be motivated to learn how to play a real instrument , or after watching a tv show that references faust and lovecraft , some people may be inspired to read the original work points out that intrinsic integration of learning content seems to be a crucial design factor , and that games that include modules for further self-studies tend to present good results the built-in encyclopedias in the civilization games are presented as an example – by using these modules gamers can dig deeper for knowledge about historical events in the gameplay in this game , developed by landka in collaboration with esa and eso , progress is rewarded with educational content , as opposed to traditional education games where learning activities are rewarded with gameplay in incidental teaching learning is not planned by the instructor or the student , it occurs as a byproduct of another activity — an experience , observation , self-reflection , interaction , unique event , or common routine task here are some steps most commonly used in incidental teaching : an instructor will arrange the learning environment so that necessary materials are within the student 's sight , but not within his reach , thus impacting his motivation to seek out those materials for example , in learning to play chess , the person must learn the rules ( cognitive domain ) —but must also learn how to set up the chess pieces and how to properly hold and move a chess piece ( psychomotor ) furthermore , later in the game the person may even learn to love the game itself , value its applications in life , and appreciate its history ( affective domain ) transfer of learning is the application of skill , knowledge or understanding to resolve a novel problem or situation that happens when certain conditions are fulfilled first , it is speculated that different types of transfer exist , including : near transfer , the application of skill to solve a novel problem in a similar context ; and far transfer , the application of skill to solve a novel problem presented in a different context furthermore , perkins and salomon ( 1992 ) suggest that positive transfer in cases when learning supports novel problem solving , and negative transfer occurs when prior learning inhibits performance on highly correlated tasks , such as second or third-language learning finally , schwarz , bransford and sears ( 2005 ) have proposed that transferring knowledge into a situation may differ from transferring knowledge out to a situation as a means to reconcile findings that transfer may both be frequent and challenging to promote early research by ruger , for example , found that the '' level of attention '' , '' attitudes '' , '' method of attack '' ( or method for tackling a problem ) , a '' search for new points of view '' , a '' careful testing of hypothesis '' and '' generalization '' were all valuable approaches for promoting transfer to encourage transfer through teaching , perkins and salomon recommend aligning ( '' hugging '' ) instruction with practice and assessment , and '' bridging '' , or encouraging learners to reflect on past experiences or make connections between prior knowledge and current content physical environment : the design , quality , and setting of a learning space , such as a school or classroom , can each be critical to the success of a learning environment if furniture is incorrectly arranged , sightlines to the instructor or instructional material are limited and the ability to suit the learning or lesson style is restricted a goal that occurs or is done at once is called an immediate goal , and distant goals are those that take time to achieve it is a condition in which an individual 's ability to acquire certain skills , knowledge through training certain attitudes , such as always finding fault in a student 's answer or provoking or embarrassing the student in front of a class are counterproductive learning activities : learning depends upon the activities and experiences provided by the teacher , his concept of discipline , methods of teaching , and above all his overall personality however , in a stable environment , this same individual needs to gather the information it needs once , and then rely on it for the rest of its life essentially , the cost of obtaining certain knowledge versus the benefit of already having it determines whether an animal evolved to learn in a given situation , or whether it innately knew the information if the cost of gaining the knowledge outweighs the benefit of having it , then the animal does not evolve to learn in this scenario—but instead , non-learning evolves however , if the benefit of having certain information outweighs the cost of obtaining it , then the animal is far more likely to evolve to have to learn this information in fact , a study of drosophila melanogaster showed that learning can actually lead to a decrease in productivity , possibly because egg-laying behaviors and decisions were impaired by interference from the memories gained from the newly learned materials or because of the cost of energy in learning however , in environments where change occurs within an animal 's lifetime but is not constant , learning is more likely to evolve learning is beneficial in these scenarios because an animal can adapt to the new situation , but can still apply the knowledge that it learns for a somewhat extended period of time the majority of plants in both experimental conditions grew in a direction consistent with the predicted location of light based on the position of the fan the previous day for example , if the seedling was trained with the fan and light coming down the same arm of the y-pipe , the following day the seedling grew towards the fan in the absence of light cues despite the fan being placed in the opposite side of the y-arm published another paper on habituation behaviors in the mimosa pudica plant whereby the innate behavior of the plant was diminished by repeated exposure to a stimulus charles abrahmson , a psychologist and behavioral biologist , says that part of the issue of why scientists disagree about whether plants have the ability to learn is that researchers do not use a consistent definition of '' learning '' and '' cognition '' similarly , michael pollan , an author , and journalist , says in his piece the intelligent plant that researchers do not doubt gagliano 's data but rather her language , specifically her use of the term “ learning ” and '' cognition '' with respect to plants for example , a machine learning system could be trained on email messages to learn to distinguish between spam and non-spam messages most of the machine learning models are based on probabilistic theories where each input ( eg : an image ) will result a probability to become the desired output
