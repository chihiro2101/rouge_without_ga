the allies totally failed to see that the best way to defend the length of the frontier was to concentrate and to crush jourdan , and although they were well informed about his collecting troops at guise , they allowed him to bring up slowly superior forces against one link of their long chain , as if their posts were so many players , each bound to defend his own wicket jourdan did not follow up his victory ; after adding the maubeuge garrison , he had about 60,000 french soldiers , opposed by 65,000 well-entrenched coalition troops on the north bank of the sambre , from solesmes on the west to thuin on the east the carnot version of history is evident in the encyclopædia britannica ( 1911 ) account : jourdan wished to renew the left attack , but carnot , the engineer , considered the wattignies plateau the key of the position and his opinion prevailed in the summer of 1793 , the 118,000-strong coalition army punched a gap in the line of french fortresses along the frontier with the austrian netherlands , with the siege of condé concluding on 12 july and the siege of valenciennes on 27 july in the battle of caesar 's camp , the coalition army under prince josias of saxe-coburg-saalfeld hustled the french army of the north out of a position near cambrai on 7 august louis alexandre andrault de langeron , a french royalist who emigrated to the russian empire attributed the coalition failure to the dunkirk expedition that split the army , the retreat from maubeuge , chronic slowness and the '' disastrous system of forming a cordon , which causes one to be weak everywhere '' historian michael glover presented carnot as a meddler and wrote of the politically powerful committee of public safety member , carnot 's talents as 'the organizer of victory ' are beyond dispute , but his tactical skills were minimal , a defect he concealed by a careful rewriting of history from 6–8 september , the army of the north under jean nicolas houchard defeated the dunkirk covering force in the battle of hondschoote , compelling the duke of york to give up the siege of dunkirk at dawn on 29 september , a column under françois sébastien charles joseph de croix , count of clerfayt crossed the sambre at berlaimont , southwest of maubeuge on 13 october , the french enjoyed initial success in a sortie against the bois du tilleul , but troops sent out to help mistakenly fired on their own friends and the french were compelled to retreat the austrian covering force was entrenched and though clerfayt was in nominal command , coburg was on the scene and in control of the battle when some soldiers complained to chancel that they were hungry and tired he replied , '' listen young men , it takes a lot of work and privation in order to gain the honor to fight and die for your country commanded by jourdan , the force included the flankers of the right with 6,048 foot in 15 battalions and 1,602 horse in five regiments and the flankers of the left with 6,821 infantry in 14 battalions and 1,323 cavalry in three regiments in the night the nearly equal partition of force , which was largely responsible for the failure , was modified , and the strength of the attack massed opposite wattignies supported by a plentiful artillery , the french infantry drove two austrian battalions out of wattignies , but as the french poured out of the other side of the village they were met by an infantry-cavalry counterattack on 17 october , the garrison sent out a column to the south to meet with jourdan , instead of to the north after the retreating coalition forces after reinforcing the army of the west and the army of the moselle each with 10,000 men , time was wasted in denouncing generals duquesnoy , meyer and gudin to drive away a poorly led covering force of 20,000 with the 45,000 available to the army of the north should have posed no great problem , but the business was sadly bungled this was the usual prelude to arrest and execution but jourdan was allowed to return to the army and put his soldiers in winter quarters two french columns attempted to raise the siege but failed , one of the columns being nearly wiped out by coalition cavalry in the battle of avesnes-le-sec according to carnot , he argued that wattignies on the austrian left was the key to the position but that jourdan wanted to attack the austrian right while jourdan was with the right wing of the army of the north , the operations of the left wing under davaine failed on 1 october 1793 , jourdan 's large army was distributed across a broad front in four great masses , starting at the north sea and running southeast the austrian commander-in-chief had plenty of soldiers but the prince of orange denied a request to send any of his soldiers to the south side of the sambre the advance guard consisted of 4,821 foot in eight battalions and 1,901 horse in five regiments ; the center division was made up of 4,077 infantry in six battalions and 428 cavalry in two regiments , with two battalions of 732 men guarding the wagon train in the thick of the bullets , jourdan bravely urged his troops on but an austrian force appeared from the direction of saint-aubin , threatening the french left flank at dawn when the austrians attacked again , the second line fired a volley into the backs of the first line and all the infantry took to their heels in a series of skirmishes , the three austrian columns pressed east , finally driving desjardin 's troops into the maubeuge entrenched camp , with losses of 150 men and two cannons from right to left the french divisions were beauregard at solre-le-château , duquesnoy on the main road from avesnes-sur-helpe , balland in reserve at avesnelles , cordellier at la capelle and fromentin at dompierre-sur-helpe on 14 october , jourdan and committee of public safety member lazare carnot reconnoitered the coalition front south of maubeuge after threatening to resign on 4 november , the army commander was recalled to paris to speak with the committee of public safety this was followed by the battle of menin on 13 september , in which the french routed a dutch corps under prince william of orange when jourdan protested that he lacked the experience to command the 104,000-man army , the representatives on mission notified him that refusal would result in his arrest though coburg might have easily seized cambrai and bouchain , which had been stripped of their garrisons to form the relief columns , the coalition commander chose to move against maubeuge instead this force was made up of five grenadier battalions , two regular battalions , of a battalion of croats , four companies and six squadrons of french royalists and six squadrons of cuirassiers supported by division commanders were franz joseph , count kinsky and joseph karl von lilien , clerfayt controlled five battalions of grenadiers , five battalions of regulars , battalion of croats , four infantry companies and 12 cavalry squadrons coburg split his forces into a 26,000-man siege army directed by the prince of orange and an army of observation jourdan enjoyed a two-to-one superiority and the coalition generals had to be anxious about the 20,000 french soldiers at maubeuge
