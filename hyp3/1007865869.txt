thumb countercurrent exchange along with cocurrent exchange and contra-current exchange comprise the mechanisms used to transfer some property of a fluid from one flowing current of fluid to another across a barrier allowing one way flow of the property between them when heat is transferred , a thermally-conductive membrane is used between the two tubes , and when the concentration of a chemical substance is transferred a semipermeable membrane is used with equal flows in the two tubes , this method of exchange is only capable of moving half of the property from one flow to the other , no matter how long the exchanger is if each stream changes its property to be 50 % closer to that of the opposite stream 's inlet condition , exchange will stop when the point of equilibrium is reached , and the gradient has declined to zero at the input end , there is a large temperature difference of 40 & nbsp ; °c and much heat transfer ; at the output end , there is a very small temperature difference ( both are at the same temperature of 40 & nbsp ; °c or close to it ) , and very little heat transfer if any at all the system consists of two tubes , one with brine ( concentrated saltwater ) , the other with freshwater ( which has a low concentration of salt in it ) , and a semi permeable membrane which allows only water to pass between the two , in an osmosis many of the water molecules pass from the freshwater flow in order to dilute the brine , while the concentration of salt in the freshwater constantly grows ( since the salt is not leaving this flow , while water is ) for example , this could be transferring heat from a hot flow of liquid to a cold one , or transferring the concentration of a dissolved solute from a high concentration flow of liquid to a low concentration flow because the hot input is at its maximum temperature of 60 & nbsp ; °c , and the exiting water at the bottom pipe is nearly at that temperature but not quite , the water in the top pipe can warm the one in the bottom pipe to nearly its own temperature at the cold end—the water exit from the top pipe , because the cold water entering the bottom pipe is still cold at 20 & nbsp ; °c , it can extract the last of the heat from the now-cooled hot water in the top pipe , bringing its temperature down nearly to the level of the cold input fluid ( 21 & nbsp ; °c ) if the two flows are not equal , for example if heat is being transferred from water to air or vice versa , then , similar to cocurrent exchange systems , a variation in the gradient is expected because of a buildup of the property not being transferred properly a countercurrent multiplication loop is a system where fluid flows in a loop so that the entrance and exit are at similar low concentration of a dissolved substance but at the far end of the loop there is a high concentration of that substance the system allows the buildup of a high concentration gradually , by allowing a natural buildup of concentration towards the tip inside the in-going tube , ( for example using osmosis of water out of the input pipe and into the buffer fluid ) , and the use of many active transport pumps each pumping only against a very small gradient , during the exit from the loop , returning the concentration inside the output pipe to its original concentration further up the loop there is a continued flow of water out of the tube and into the buffer , gradually raising the concentration of nacl in the tube until it reaches 1199 & nbsp ; mg/l at the tip the returning tube has active transport pumps , pumping salt out to the buffer liquid at a low difference of concentrations of up to 200 & nbsp ; mg/l more than in the tube in effect , this can be seen as a gradually multiplying effect—hence the name of the phenomena : a 'countercurrent multiplier ' or the mechanism : countercurrent multiplication , but in current engineering terms , countercurrent multiplication is any process where only slight pumping is needed , due to the constant small difference of concentration or heat along the process , gradually raising to its maximum a circuit of fluid in the loop of henle—an important part of the kidneys allows for gradual buildup of the concentration of urine in the kidneys , by using active transport on the exiting nephrons ( tubules carrying liquid in the process of gradually concentrating the urea ) the active transport pumps need only to overcome a constant and low gradient of concentration , because of the countercurrent multiplier mechanism see the countercurrent multiplier animation at the colorado university website the semipermeable membrane of the thin descending limb does not permit passage of ions or large dissolved molecules gradually there is a buildup of osmotic concentration , until 1200 mosm is reached at the loop tip , but the difference across the membrane is kept small and constant pumps further up the thin ascending limb , pump out from 400 mosm into liquid at 600 mosm , so again the difference is retained at 200 mosm from the inside to the outside , while the concentration both inside and outside are gradually decreasing as the liquid flow advances : the liquid finally reaches a low concentration of 100 mosm when leaving the thin ascending limb and passing through the thick one water or liquid with very low osmotic concentration leaving the nephrons is reabsorbed in the peritubular capillaries and returned to the blood reabsorbing and increasing the concentration is done by optionally absorbing potassium ( k + ) and hydrogen ( h + ) cations , while releasing water and the continued pumping out of calcium ( ca + ) and salt ( na + and cl − ions ) the collecting duct may continue raising the concentration if required , by gradually pumping out the same ions as the distal convoluted tubule , using the same gradient as the ascending limbs in the loop of henle , and reaching the same concentration initially the countercurrent exchange mechanism and its properties were proposed in 1951 by professor werner kuhn and two of his former students who called the mechanism found in the loop of henle in mammalian kidneys a countercurrent multiplier the original lecture was published in 1951 in german gottschalk points to the heated debate prior to the acceptance of the theory of the countercurrent multiplier action of the kidney homer smith , a considerable contemporary authority on renal physiology , opposed the model countercurrent concentration for 8 years , until conceding ground in 1959 birds and mammals that regularly immerse their limbs in cold or icy water have particularly well developed counter-current blood flow systems to their limbs , allowing prolonged exposure of the extremities to the cold without significant loss of body heat , even when the limbs are as thin as the lower legs , or tarsi , of a bird , for instance as the ( cold ) blood flows back up from the paws through the veins , it picks up heat from the blood flowing in the opposite direction , so that it returns to the torso in a warm state , allowing the fox to maintain a comfortable temperature , without losing it to the snow although the fluid in the tubules is with a higher concentration of salt than the blood , the flow is arranged in a countercurrent exchange , so that the blood with a high concentration of salt enters the system close to where the gland tubules exit and connect to the main canal thus , all along the gland , there is only a small gradient to climb , in order to push the salt from the blood to the salty fluid with active transport powered by atp the blood supply system to the gland is set in countercurrent exchange loop mechanism for keeping the high concentration of salt in the gland 's blood , so that it does n't leave back to the blood system image : coflore acx.png thumb left 120px counter flow in liquid-liquid extraction liquid-liquid extraction ( also called 'solvent extraction ' or 'partitioning ' ) is a common method for extracting a substance from one liquid into another liquid at a different 'phase ' ( such as '' slurry '' ) thumb cement may be created using a countercurrent kiln where the heat is passed in the cement and the exhaust combined , while the incoming air draft is passed along the two , absorbing the heat and retaining it inside the furnace , finally reaching high temperatures gasification : the process of creating methane and carbon monoxide from organic or fossil matter , can be done using a counter-current fixed bed ( '' up draft '' ) gasifier which is built in a similar way to the anagama kiln , and must therefore withstand more harsh conditions , but reaches better efficiency
