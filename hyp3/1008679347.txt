by the day of the battle wellington had decided to withdraw his army all the way back to portugal , but observed that with the two armies marching parallel to each other , with the british on the

being defeated by the 3rd and 5th divisions of anglo-portuguese infantry when le marchant 's dragoons charged in and destroyed battalion after battalion with the heavy cavalrymen 's weapons , the sword and exercise for which had been designed by le marchant the siege of burgos ensued , then in the autumn the anglo-portuguese retreated to portugal when renewed french concentrations threatened to trap them , although the french forces , which had been stripped of several experienced units to join the russian campaign , were reluctant to go on the offensive ludlow history of the king 's
