this morning twilight before sunrise is divided into three categories depending on the amount of sunlight that is present in the sky , which is determined by the angular distance of the centre of the sun ( degrees below the horizon ) in the morning in islam , astronomical dawn is called false morning ( subhe-kadhib , arabic صبح کاذب ) while nautical dawn is called sehr ( سحر ) or true morning ( subhe-sadiq , arabic صبح صادق ) and it is the time of first prayer of the day , and the beginning of the daily fast during ramadan dawn begins with the first sight of lightness in the morning , and continues until the sun breaks the horizon when the sun gets 9.0 to 9.5 degrees below the horizon ( at summer solstice this is at latitudes 57°30′–57°00′ ) , the zenith gets dark even on cloud-free nights ( if there is no full moon ) , and the brightest stars are clearly visible in a large majority of the sky others , including the vilna gaon , have the understanding that the talmud 's timeframe for dawn was referring specifically to an equinox day in mesopotamia , and is therefore teaching that dawn should be calculated daily as commencing when the sun is 16.1 degrees below the horizon formally , it begins when the sun is 12 degrees below the horizon in the morning formally , it occurs when the sun is 6 degrees below the horizon in the morning prime is the fixed time of prayer of the traditional divine office ( canonical hours ) in christian liturgy , said at the first hour of daylight astronomical dawn begins when the sun is 18 degrees below the horizon in the morning in judaism , the question of how to calculate dawn ( hebrew alos/ hashachar , or alos/ is posed by the talmud , pesachim 94a as it has many ramifications for jewish law ( such as the possible start time for certain daytime commandments , like prayer ) the period of twilight is shortest at the equator , where the equinox sun rises due east and sets due west , at a right angle to the horizon
