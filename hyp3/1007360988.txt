like other plecos , they benefit from the addition of bogwood , which they will rasp at and use as a hiding place & nbsp ; – in the absence of other plant matter ( sources of fibre ) , wood may be essential to the survival of these fish in the aquarium , as it helps digestion of typically high protein fish food many species are found in the rivers and floodplain areas of the amazon basin , but there are also species elsewhere in tropical south america , as well as two species , a in contrast to many other loricariid 'plecos ' ( many of which regularly exceed a foot in captivity ) , the bristlenose plecos do not usually exceed six inches in length ; they can thus be kept in relatively small tanks , contributing to their popularity in the aquarium hobby 250px these fish are often kept by aquarists , as they are dutiful algae-eaters and smaller in adult size than the common plecos usually seen in pet shops caution should be taken with the spines ( odontodes ) & nbsp ; ; although the risk of personal injury is small with this genus , the hooked nature of the odontodes means that a bristlenose may become trapped in non-natural material such as sponge filters and netting ancistrus is one of the widest ranging loricariid genera , and representatives are found in most areas where the family in general is present ancistrus species are unusual among vertebrates in possessing an x0 sex-determination system , which is the prevailing method in many lineages of arthropod but is very rare elsewhere in the animal kingdom the feature most commonly associated with the genus are the fleshy tentacles found on the head in adult males ; females may possess tentacles along the snout margin but they are smaller and they lack tentacles on the head these are the only known loricariids that possess adaptions for a subterranean lifestyle , such as reduced pigmentation ( appearing overall whitish ) and eyes in comparison with a typical loricariid ( pleco ) , a bristlenose is typically shorter ( 4–6 inches or 15 & nbsp ; cm or less ) , more flattened and fatter with a comparatively wider head females prefer males that are already protecting eggs and may prefer males that are protecting larvae ; it has been suggested that the tentacles may act as a fry mimic to attract females , which would allow males without eggs in their nest to compete with males guarding eggs anderson , luís alves ; oliveira , claudio ; nirchio , mauro ; granado , ángel and foresti , fausto ; ‘ karyotypic relationships among the tribes of hypostominae ( siluriformes : loricariidae ) with description of xo sex chromosome system in a neotropical fish species ’ ; genetica , vol the fry remain in the cave , attaching to the walls and ceiling with their mouths , absorbing their yolk sac in 2–4 days and becoming free swimming
