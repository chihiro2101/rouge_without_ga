( 59 bc & ndash ; ad 17 ) the palatine hill got its name from the arcadian settlers from pallantium , named from its founder pallas of arcadia the name of the hill is the etymology origin of the word palace and its cognates in other languages ( greek : παλάτιον , , , spanish : palacio , portuguese : palácio , , , etc from the oxford english dictionary the palatine hill is also the etymology origin ( via the latin adjective of '' palatine '' , a 16th-century english adjective that originally signified something pertaining to the caesar 's palace , or someone who is invested with the king 's authority according to roman mythology , the palatine hill was the location of the cave , known as the lupercal , where romulus and remus were found by the she-wolf lupa that kept them alive excavations performed on the hill in 1907 and again in 1948 unearthed a collection of huts believed to have been used for funerary purposes between the 9th and 7th century bc approximating the time period when the city of rome was founded the myth of the city 's origin was significant in ancient roman mythology because pallantium became one of the cities that was merged later into ancient rome , thereby tying rome 's origins to the ancient greek heroes dionysius of halicarnassus also mention that some writers , including polybius of megalopolis , say that the town was named after pallas , who was the son of heracles and lavinia , the daughter of evander , and when he died his grandfather raised a tomb to him on the hill and called the place pallantium , after him from the start of the empire ( 27 bc ) augustus built his palace there and the hill gradually became the exclusive domain of emperors ; the ruins of the palaces of at least augustus ( 27 bc & ndash ; 14 ad ) , tiberius ( 14 & ndash ; 37 ad ) and domitian ( 81 & ndash ; 96 ad ) can still be seen 120 from the 16th century , the hill was owned by the farnese family and was occupied by the farnese gardens , still partially preserved above the remains of the domus tiberiana at the top of the hill , between the domus flavia and the domus augustana , the villa mattei was built in the 16th century , then purchased around 1830 by the scot charles mills who turned it into an elaborate neo-gothic villa '' the two-story house appears to have been built around an atrium , with frescoed walls and mosaic flooring , and is situated on the slope of the palatine that overlooks the colosseum and the arch of constantine the republican-era houses on the palatine were overbuilt by later palaces after the great fire of rome ( ad 64 ) , but apparently this one was not and perhaps was preserved for an important reason
