in 1987 , rothamsted , the long ashton research station , and broom 's barn experimental station merged to form the institute of arable crops research ( iacr ) rothamsted is now operated by a grouping of private organizations under the name of rothamsted research and is mainly funded by various branches of the uk government through the biotechnology and biological sciences research council and department for environment , food and rural affairs ( defra ) thumb left the rothamsted experimental station was founded in 1843 by john bennet lawes , a noted victorian era entrepreneur and scientist who had founded one of the first artificial fertilizer manufacturing factories in 1842 , on his 16th century estate , rothamsted manor , to investigate the impact of inorganic and organic fertilizers on crop yield rothamsted research lawes agricultural trust rothamsted history rothamsted manor the electronic rothamsted documents archive : digital collection of annual reports , guides , maps and documents relating to the various long-term experiments at rothamsted rothamsted repository - research publications of the institute back to 1843 long-term experiment genstat , a statistical package originally developed at rothamsted research , which is reflected in its capacity to handle complex block designs of the type likely to occur in agricultural multi-treatment experiments as well as the rothamsted site rothamsted research operates : broom 's barn , a experimental farm near bury st edmunds , suffolk , which is the uk 's national centre for sugar beet research thumb partly through these methods , researchers at rothamsted have made significant contributions to agricultural science , including the discovery and development of systemic herbicides and pyrethroid insecticides , as well as pioneering contributions to the fields of virology , nematology , soil science and pesticide resistance the long ashton research station was closed in 2002 , with some of its staff moved to rothamsted , whilst broom 's barn is operated as an experimental farm for rothamsted sir john russell was a director of rothamsted and his book emphasises the role of rothamsted in the development of agricultural science in britain during world war ii , aiming to increase crop yields for a nation at war , a team under the leadership of judah hirsch quastel developed 2,4-d , still the most widely used weed-killer in the world john russell , who had come from wye in 1907 , took over as director until 1943 , overseeing a major expansion in the 1920s , when sir william gammie ogg took over until 1958 and increasing the number of staff from 140 to 471 and creating new biochemistry , nematode , and pedology departments '' fisher analysed the data and stayed to create the theory of experimental design , making rothamsted a major centre for research in statistics and genetics
