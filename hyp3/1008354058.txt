one day , a rich and rakish landowner , rodolphe boulanger , brings a servant to the doctor 's office to be bled rodolphe does not share her enthusiasm for this plan and on the eve of their planned departure , he ends the relationship with an apologetic , self-effacing letter placed at the bottom of a basket of apricots delivered to emma while charles believes that she is taking piano lessons , emma travels to the city each week to meet léon , always in the same room of the same hotel , which the two come to view as their home emma bovary is the novel 's eponymous protagonist ( charles 's mother and his former wife are also referred to as madame bovary , while their daughter remains mademoiselle bovary ) it is the disparity between these romantic ideals and the realities of her country life that drive most of the novel , leading her into two affairs and to accrue an insurmountable amount of debt that eventually leads to her suicide she lives a life of the mind , and it is her introspection and analysis of her internal conflicts that marks the psychological growth of flaubert as an author after his decision to escape with emma , he resigns and feels unable to handle it , especially the existence of her daughter , berthe the setting of the novel is important , first as it applies to flaubert 's realist style and social commentary , and , second , as it relates to the protagonist , emma flaubert knew the regional setting , the place of his birth and youth , in and around the city of rouen in normandy his faithfulness to the mundane elements of country life has garnered the book its reputation as the beginning of the movement known as literary realism flaubert 's friend and mentor , louis bouilhet , had suggested to him that this might be a suitably '' down-to-earth '' subject for a novel and that flaubert should attempt to write in a '' natural way , '' without digressions while writing the novel , he wrote that it would be '' a book about nothing , a book dependent on nothing external , which would be held together by the internal strength of its style , '' an aim which , for the critic jean rousset , made flaubert '' the first in date of the non-figurative novelists , '' such as james joyce and virginia woolf 130 though flaubert avowed no liking for the style of balzac , the novel he produced became arguably a prime example and an enhancement of literary realism in the vein of balzac the '' realism '' in the novel was to prove an important element in the trial for obscenity : the lead prosecutor argued that not only was the novel immoral , but that realism in literature was also an offence against art and decency emma may be said to be the embodiment of a romantic : in her mental and emotional process , she has no relation to the realities of her world '' vargas llosa quoted in madame bovary has been seen as a commentary on the bourgeoisie , the folly of aspirations that can never be realized or a belief in the validity of a self-satisfied , deluded personal culture , associated with flaubert 's period , especially during the reign of louis philippe , when the middle class grew to become more identifiable in contrast to the working class and the nobility in his dictionary of received ideas , the bourgeoisie is characterized by intellectual and spiritual superficiality , raw ambition , shallow culture , a love of material things , greed , and above all a mindless parroting of sentiments and beliefs for vargas llosa , '' emma 's drama is the gap between illusion and reality , the distance between desire and its fulfillment '' and shows '' the first signs of alienation that a century later will take hold of men and women in industrial societies long established as one of the greatest novels , the book has been described as a '' perfect '' work of fiction henry james wrote : '' madame bovary has a perfection that not only stamps it , but that makes it stand almost alone : it holds itself with such a supreme unapproachable assurance as both excites and defies judgment vii similarly , in his preface to his novel the joke , milan kundera wrote , '' not until the work of flaubert did prose lose the stigma of aesthetic inferiority '' giorgio de chirico said that in his opinion '' from the narrative point of view , the most perfect book is madame bovary by flaubert '' the novel exemplifies the tendency of realism , over the course of the nineteenth century , to become increasingly psychological , concerned with the accurate representation of thoughts and emotions rather than of external things madame bovary has had the following film adaptations : unholy love ( 1932 ) , directed by albert ray madame bovary ( 1934 ) , directed by jean renoir and starring max dearly and valentine
