reflecting the original purpose of transporting people and luggage between estate ( land ) and railway stations , the body style is called an '' estate car '' or '' estate '' in the united kingdom , or a '' station wagon '' in north america , new zealand , australian and africa station wagons have been marketed using the french term '' break de chasse '' ( sometimes abbreviated to '' break '' ) , which translates as '' hunting break '' , due to shared ancestry with the shooting-brake body style station wagons and hatchbacks have in common a two-box design configuration , a shared interior volume for passengers and cargo and a rear door ( often called a tailgate in the case of a wagon ) that is hinged at roof level distinguishing features between hatchbacks and station wagons are : d-pillar : station wagons are more likely to have a d-pillar ( hatchbacks and station wagons both have a- , b- and c-pillars ) of the two body styles , a station wagon roof ( viewed in profile ) more likely extends to the very rearmost of the vehicle , enclosing a full-height cargo volume — a hatchback roof ( especially a liftback roof ) might more likely rake down steeply behind the c-pillar , prioritizing style over interior volume , with shorter rear overhang and with smaller windows ( or no windows ) aside the cargo volume other differences are more variable and can potentially include : cargo floor contour : a station wagon often has a fold-flat floor ( for increased cargo capacity ) , whereas a hatchback is more likely to have a cargo floor with a pronounced contour the rearmost row of seating in a station wagon is often located in the cargo area and can be front-facing , rear-facing , or side-facing rear door : hatchbacks usually feature a top-hinged liftgate for cargo access , with variations ranging from a two-part lift-gate to a complex tailgate that can function either as a full tailgate or as a trunk/boot lid a design director from general motors has described the difference as '' where you break the roofline , at what angle , defines the spirit of the vehicle '' , he said '' it has become common for station wagons to use a platform shared with other body styles , resulting in many shared components ( such as chassis , engine , transmission , bodywork forward of the a-pillar , interior features , and optional features ) being used for the wagon , sedan and hatchback variants of the car model later in the decade , electric power was applied to the tailgate window—it could be operated from the driver 's seat , as well as by the keyhole in the rear door in the united states , ford 's full-size station wagons for 1966 introduced a system marketed as '' magic doorgate '' — a conventional tailgate with retracting rear glass , where the tailgate could either fold down or pivot open on a side hinge — with the rear window retracted in either case for 1969 , ford incorporated a design that allowed the rear glass to remain up or down when the door pivoted open on its side hinge , marketing the system , which had been engineered by donald n when opened as a swinging door , this part of the bumper moved away , allowing the depression in the bumper to provide a '' step '' to ease entry ; when the gate was opened by being lowered or raised to a closed position , the chrome section remained in place making the bumper '' whole '' full-size general motors 1971–1976 wagons — the chevrolet kingswood estate ; pontiac grand safari ; oldsmobile custom cruiser , and the buick estate models — featured a 'clam shell ' design marketed as the glide-away tailgate , also called a '' disappearing '' tailgate because when open , the tailgate was completely out of view on the clam shell design , the rear power-operated glass slid up into the roof and the lower tailgate ( with either manual or optional power operation ) , lowered completely below the load floor station wagons with the design featured an optional third row of forward-facing seats accessed by the rear side doors and a folding second-row seat — and could accommodate a 4 x 8 ' sheet of plywood with rear seats folded the clam shell design required no increased footprint or operational area to open , allowing a user to stand at the cargo opening without the impediment of a door — for example , in a closed garage fold-up license plate : wagons ( including the volvo amazon wagon , early models of the range-rover , and the subaru baja ) had an upward folding hinged license plate attached to the lower tailgate of the split rear door the wagon versions of the citroen ds , variously called the break , familiale or safari , had a different solution : two number plates were fitted to the tailgate at right angles to each other so one would be visible in either position in 1923 star ( a division of durant motors ) became the first car company to offer a station wagon assembled on its production line ( using a wooden wagon body shipped in from an outside supplier ) in 1922 , the essex ( automobile ) became the first mass-produced car to use a steel body ( in this case , a fully enclosed sedan body style ) station wagons were initially considered commercial vehicles ( rather than consumer automobiles ) and the framing of the early station wagons was left unsheathed , due to the commercial nature of the vehicles one of the first builders of wagon bodies was the stoughton wagon company from wisconsin , who begun putting custom wagon bodies on the ford model t chassis in 1919 and by 1929 the ford motor company was the biggest producer of chassis ' for station wagons the late 1950s through the mid-1960s was also the period of greatest variation in body styles , with models available without a b-pillar ( called hardtop or pillarless models ) or with a b-pillar , both in 2-door and 4-door variants gm eliminated the pillarless wagon from its lineup in 1959 , while amc and ford exited the field beginning with their 1960 and 1961 vehicles , leaving chrysler and dodge with the body style through the 1964 model year the us cafe standards provided an advantage to minivans ( and later suvs ) over station wagons , because the minivans and suvs were classified as trucks in the united states , and therefore subject to less stringent fuel economy and emissions regulations with other brands , the niche previously occupied by station wagons is now primarily filled with a similar style of crossover suv , which generally has a car underpinning and a wagon body european luxury car manufacturers such as audi , volvo , bmw , and mercedes-benz continued to offer station wagons in their north american product ranges ( marketed using the labels '' avant '' , '' touring '' , and '' estate '' respectively ) the ford country squire is a model that was easily recognized by its simulated wood trim and the '' squire '' trim level was an available option in a few different ford model ranges , including the falcon squire , fairlane squire , and in the 1970s the ford pinto from the 1950s to 1990s , many full-size american station wagons could be optioned with a third row of seating in the cargo area ( over the rear axle ) for a total of nine seats however , the 1964–1972 oldsmobile vista cruiser and 1964–1969 buick sport wagon featured raised roof-lines beginning above the second-row seat and continuing all the way to the rear tailgate , resulting in the third row of seats being forward-facing the ford and mercury full-size wagons built after 1964 were available with four rows of seats , with the rear two rows in the cargo area and facing each other the fd- and fe-series vauxhall victors , built between 1966 and 1978 , were very large cars by british standards and featured station wagon models in the style of an american station wagon with front and rear bench seats and large-capacity petrol engines some larger station wagon models are available with a third row of seats , such as the rear-facing jump seat for two passengers in the cargo area of the mercedes-benz e-class wagon the type 3 's rear-engine layout was retained for the station wagon models , but the engine profile was flattened , resulting in a small car offering interior room , as well as trunk space in the front in 1958 , the citroën id break ( known as the safari in english-speaking countries ) was introduced , being larger than other french station wagon models and of similar size to the contemporary full-size station wagons from the united states the successors to the id , the citroën cx and citroën xm continued to be amongst the largest station wagon cars produced in europe , but the model was discontinued in 2000 and a station wagon version was not available for its citroën c6 successor as with the citroëns , changing demands in the french car market led to the end of the large peugeot station wagon models in the mid-1990s , with the smaller peugeot 406 becoming the largest station wagon model in the range from 1995 in a similar situation to the united states , the decline of traditional break and familiale models in france was in no small part due to the introduction of the minivan in the form of the renault espace in 1984 volvo station wagons produced since the mid-1990s are the volvo s40 , volvo v50 , volvo v60 , volvo v70 and volvo v90 , with the v40 , v60 and v90 models currently in production in 1983 , station wagons represented 15 % of the passenger car market , reflecting a trend throughout europe of increasing popularity through the 1980s , with the vehicles becoming less cargo-oriented for example , a sedan might have a model life of four years , but the wagon was not updated for up to eight years ( such as the toyota corolla wagon built from 1979 to 1987 ) and the 1987-1996 mazda capella wagon ) the ford and holden wagons were usually built on a longer wheelbase than their sedan counterparts , until the introduction of the holden commodore ( ve ) which switched to sharing the sedan 's shorter wheelbase ford ceased production of wagons in australia when the ford falcon ( bf ) ended production in 2010 , largely due to the declining station wagon and large car market , but also following the 2004 introduction and sales success of the ford territory suv
