sikes is a thug ; fagin lives by corrupting children , and the artful dodger seems born for a life of crime many of the middle-class people oliver encounters—mrs sowerberry , mr bumble , and the savagely hypocritical '' gentlemen '' of the workhouse board , for example—are , if anything , worse the 2005 film adaptation of oliver twist of the novel dispenses with the paradox of oliver 's genteel origins by eliminating his origin story completely , making him just another anonymous orphan like the rest of fagin 's gang the '' merry old gentleman '' fagin , for example , has satanic characteristics : he is a veteran corrupter of young boys who presides over his own corner of the criminal world ; he makes his first appearance standing over a fire holding a toasting-fork , and he refuses to pray on the night before his execution 48 the london slums , too , have a suffocating , infernal aspect ; the dark deeds and dark passions are concretely characterised by dim rooms and pitch-black nights , while the governing mood of terror and brutality may be identified with uncommonly cold weather oliver himself , though '' badged and ticketed '' as a lowly orphan and named according to an alphabetical system , is , in fact , '' all of a twist mrs mann , who has charge of the infant oliver , is not the most motherly of women ; mr bumble , despite his impressive sense of his own dignity , continually mangles the king 's english he tries to use ; and the sowerberries are , of course , '' sour berries '' , a reference to mrs sowerberry 's perpetual scowl , to mr sowerberry 's profession as an undertaker , and to the poor provender oliver receives from them crime and punishment is another important pair of themes , as is sin and redemption : dickens describes criminal acts ranging from picking pockets to murder , and the characters are punished severely in the end when he was later criticised for giving a '' thieving , whoring slut of the streets '' such an unaccountable reversal of character , dickens ascribed her change of heart to '' the last fair drop of water at the bottom of a dried-up , weed-choked well '' nadia valman , in antisemitism : a historical encyclopedia of prejudice and persecution , argues that fagin 's representation was drawn from the image of the jew as inherently evil , that the imagery associated him with the devil , and with beasts '' dickens ( who had extensive knowledge of london street life and child exploitation ) explained that he had made fagin jewish because '' it unfortunately was true , of the time to which the story refers , that that class of criminal almost invariably was a jew '' dickens commented that by calling fagin a jew he had meant no imputation against the jewish faith , saying in a letter , '' i have no feeling towards the jews but a friendly one i always speak well of them , whether in public or private , and bear my testimony ( as i ought to do ) to their perfect good faith in such transactions as i have ever had with them '' eliza davis , whose husband had purchased dickens 's home in 1860 when he had put it up for sale , wrote to dickens in protest at his portrayal of fagin , arguing that he had '' encouraged a vile prejudice against the despised hebrew '' , and that he had done a great wrong to the jewish people while dickens first reacted defensively upon receiving davis 's letter , he then halted the printing of oliver twist , and changed the text for the parts of the book that had not been set , which explains why after the first 38 chapters fagin is barely called '' the jew '' at all in the next 179 references to him oliver & company ( 1988 ) , disney full-length animated feature inspired by the story of oliver twist the story takes place in modern-day new york city , with oliver ( voiced by joey lawrence ) portrayed as an orphaned kitten , the dodger as a street-wise mongrel ( voiced by billy joel ) , and fagin ( voiced by dom deluise ) as a homeless bum who lives on the docks with his pack of stray dogs that he trains to steal so he can survive and repay his debt to loan shark sykes ( voiced by robert loggia ) twisted ( 1996 ) , an independent film based on charles dickens ' novel oliver twist set in the gay underground sub-culture of new york city in the 1990s and starring emmy award , tony award , grammy award winner billy porter and academy award nominee william hickey ( actor ) directed by seth michael donsky twist ( 2003 ) , an independent film loosely based on charles dickens ' novel oliver twist oliver twist ( 2005 ) , directed by roman polanski and starring barney clark and ben kingsley saban 's adventures of oliver twist , a 52 episode animated american-french co-production that aired between 1996 and 1997 , where the story is downplayed for younger viewers , where oliver loses his mother in a crowd rather than being dead and the characters are represented by anthropomorphic animals in 1838 charles zachary barnett 's adaptation , the three-act burletta oliver twist ;
