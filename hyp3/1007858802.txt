in the theories postulated by ferdinand lot and roger sherman loomis , lancelot is related to llenlleog ( llenlleawc ) , an irishman in culhwch and olwen ( which associates him with the '' headland of gan ( i ) on '' ) , and the welsh hero llwch llawwynnauc ( most likely a version of the euhemerism irish deity lugh lonbemnech , with '' llwch '' meaning '' lake '' in welsh ) , possibly via a now-forgotten epithet such as lamhcalad , bruce , the arthurian name dictionary , p proponents of the scythian origins of the arthurian legend have speculated that an early form might have been alanus-à-lot , that is '' alan of the lot river '' , while those looking for clues in antiquity see elements of lancelot in the ancient greek mythical figures of askalos and mopsus ( moxus ) alfred anscombe proposed in 1913 that the name '' lancelot '' came from germanic wlancloth , with roots in the old english wlenceo ( pride ) and loða ( cloak ) , alfred anscombe ( 1913 ) , '' the name of sir lancelot du lake '' , the celtic review 8 ( 32 ) : 365–366 according to more recent scholars , such as norma lorre goodrich , the name , if not just an invention of the 12th-century french poet chrétien de troyes , may have been derived from geoffrey of monmouth 's character anguselaus , probably a latinised name of unguist , the name of a son of the 6th-century picts king forgus ; when translated from geoffrey 's latin into old french , it would became anselaus other 6th-century figures proposed in modern times as candidates for the prototype of lancelot include the early french saint fraimbault de lassay ; wlanca , a son-in-law of the anglo-saxon king ælle of sussex ; maelgwn , king of gwynedd ; and llaennog ( llaenauc ) , father of gwallog , king of elmet the theft of an infant by a water fairy , the appearance of the hero at a tournament on three consecutive days in three different disguises , and the rescue of a queen or princess from an otherworld prison are all features of a well-known and widespread tale , variants of which are found in numerous examples collected by theodore hersart de la villemarqué in his barzaz breiz , by emmanuel cosquin in his contes lorrains , and by john francis campbell in his tales of the west highlands it is not until chrétien 's poem lancelot , the knight of the cart ( le chevalier de la charrette ) , however , that lancelot becomes the protagonist it is also chrétien who first gives lancelot the name lancelot du lac ( lancelot of the lake ) , william farina , chretien de troyes and the dawn of arthurian romance ( 2010 ) page 13 : '' strictly speaking , the name lancelot du lac ( '' lancelot of the lake '' ) first appears in chrétien 's arthurian debut , erec and enide ( line 1674 ) , as a member of the roundtable 170 : '' this is the book of my lord lancelot du lac in which all his deeds and chivalric conduct are contained and the coming of the holy grail and his quest ( which was ) made and achieved by the good knights , galahad in the words of matilda bruckner , '' what existed before chrétien remains uncertain , but there is no doubt that his version became the starting point for all subsequent tales of lancelot as the knight whose extraordinary prowess is inextricably linked to his love for arthur 's queen lancelot 's passion for arthur 's wife guinevere is entirely absent from another early work , lanzelet , a middle high german epic poem by ulrich von zatzikhoven dating from the very end of the 12th century ( no earlier than 1194 ) in lanzelet , the abductor of ginover ( guinevere ) is named as king valerin , whose name , unlike that of chrétien 's meliagant , does not appear to derive from the welsh melwas similar to chrétien 's version , lanzelet too is raised by a water fairy ( here the queen of the maidenland ) , having lost his father king pant of genewis to a rebellion if this is true , then the motif of adultery might either have been invented by chrétien for his chevalier de la charrette or have been present in the ( now lost ) source provided to him by his patroness , marie de champagne , a lady well known for her keen interest in matters relating to courtly love lancelot 's character was further developed during the 13th century in the old french prose romance vulgate cycle , where he appears prominently in the later parts , known as the prose lancelot ( or lancelot du lac ) , the queste del saint graal ( the quest for the holy grail ) , and the mort artu ( the death of arthur ) the forbidden love affair between lancelot and guinevere can be seen as a parallel to that of tristan and iseult , with lancelot ultimately being identified with the tragedy of chance and human failing that is responsible for the downfall of the round table in the later works continuing chrétien 's story lancelot would later become one of the chief knights associated with the holy grail , but chrétien does not include him at all in his final romance , perceval , le conte du graal ( perceval , or the story of the grail ) , the unfinished story that introduced the motif into medieval literature near the end of the 15th century , malory 's le morte d'arthur followed the lancelot-grail cycle in presenting lancelot as the best knight , a departure from the preceding english tradition in which gawain had been the most prominent in the vulgate cycle , lancelot , birth name galahad ( originally written galaad or galaaz , not to be confused with his own son galahad ) , is born '' in the borderland between gaul and brittany '' as the son of the gallo-roman king ban of benwick ( bénoïc , corresponding to the eastern part of anjou ) , which is overrun by their enemy , claudas as elaine is tending to her dying husband , lancelot is carried off by a fairy enchantress known as the lady of the lake , who then raises the child in her magical realm while elaine becomes a nun ( in an alternate version from the italian la tavola ritonda , lancelot is born when the late ban 's wife gostanza delivers him two months early and soon after also dies ; here , the lady of the lake 's only relation to lancelot is briefly abducting him as an adult his double-cousins lionel and bors the younger , sons of king bors of gaul and elaine of benoic 's sister evaine , are first taken by a knight of claudas and later spirited away to the lady of the lake to become lancelot 's junior companions many of them will also join him at the round table , as do all of those mentioned above , as well as some of their sons , such as elyan the white , and lancelot 's own son , too in the prose lancelot , the minor knights of the round table also mentioned as related to lancelot in one way or another are aban , acantan the agile , banin , blamor , brandinor , crinides the black , danubre the brave , gadran , hebes the famous , lelas , ocursus the black , pincados , tanri , and more ( they are different and fewer in malory ) initially known only as the nameless white knight ( blanc chevalier ) , clad in silver steel on a white horse , the young lancelot ( claiming to be 18 years old , although it later revealed how he is really only 15 ) arrives in arthur 's kingdom of logres with the lady of the lake to be knighted by the king at her behest the lady gives him a powerful magic ring able to dispel any enchantment ( as his anonymous fairy foster mother also does in chrétien 's version ; later parts of the vulgate lancelot instead retcon this as given to him by guinevere ) , among other enchanted items with various abilities ( including a lance and a sword , a tent , and a mirror ) in the post-vulgate , where lancelot is no longer the central protagonist , he instead comes to arthur 's court alone and almost defeats the king himself on their first meeting without knowing his identity ( excalibur , meant to be used only for the sake of the kingdom and justice , may be broken either in this fight or the one against king pellinore ) in malory 's le morte d'arthur , the adulterous relationship is postponed for years , as lancelot 's rescue of the queen from meleagant ( during which , as malory wrote , '' sir launcelot wente to bedde with the quene and toke no force of his hurte honed , but toke his plesaunce and hys lyknge untyll hit was the dawning of the day '' after breaking through the iron bars of her prison chamber with his bare hands ) takes place following the grail quest lancelot 's initial knight-errant style adventures from the vulgate cycle that have been included in malory 's compilation range from proving victorious in a tournament fighting on behalf of king bagdemagus , slaying the mighty villain turquine , who had been holding several of arthur 's knights prisoner , to overcoming a damsel 's betrayal and defending himself unarmed against her husband phelot the motif of his recurring fits of madness ( especially '' in presence of sexually charged women '' ) and suicidal tendencies ( usually relating to the false or real news of the death of either gawain or galehaut ) return often throughout the vulgate and sometimes in other versions as well galahaut is arthur 's enemy and poised to become the victor , but he is taken by lancelot 's amazing battlefield performance and offers him a boon in return for the privilege of one night 's company in the bivouac lancelot becomes one of the most famous knights of the round table , even attested as the best knight in the world in malory 's own episode of sir urry of hungary , as well as an object of desire by many ladies , beginning with the lady of malehaut when he is her captive early on in the vulgate lancelot lancelot , shown the holy grail through a veil , is cured of his madness , and then chooses to live with her on a remote isle where he is known incognito as the wicked knight ( chevalier malfait , the form also used by malory ) the quest is initiated by lancelot 's estranged son , the young teenage galahad , having prevailed over his father in a duel during his own dramatic arrival at camelot , among other acts that proved him as the most perfect knight ) when the truth is finally revealed to arthur by morgan , it leads to the death of three of gawain 's brothers ( agravain , gaheris and gareth ) when lancelot with his family and followers arrive to violently save guinevere from being burned at the stake and slaughter the men sent by arthur to guard the execution , ncludingg those who went unwilling and unarmed ( as did gereth ) in malory 's version , agravain is killed by him earlier , during lancelot 's bloody escape from camelot , as well as florent and lovel , two of gawain 's sons who accompanied agravain and mordred in their ambush of lancelot in guinevere 's chambers the eventual result of this is the betrayal of arthur by mordred , the king 's bastard son ( and formerly one of lancelot 's young followers ) , who falsely announces arthur 's death to seize the throne for himself upon receiving a desperate letter from the dying gawain offering him forgiveness and asking for his help in the fight against mordred , lancelot hurries to return to britain with his army , only to hear the news of arthur 's death at salisbury plain ( romance version of the battle of camlann ) in the original from the vulgate mort artu , after mourning his comrades , lancelot 's participation in a victorious war against the young sons of mordred and their briton supporters and saxon allies provides him with partial atonement for his earlier role in the story in it , guinevere blames all the destruction of the round table upon their adulterous relationship , which is the seed of all the dismay that followed , and becomes a nun the distraught lancelot 's health then begins to fail ( in fact , le morte d'arthur states that even before this time , he had lost a cubit of height due to his fastings and prayers ) he has been played by robert taylor in knights of the round table ( 1953 ) , william russell in the adventures of sir lancelot ( 1956–1957 ) , robert goulet in camelot ( 1960 ) , cornel wilde in sword of lancelot ( 1963 ) , franco nero in camelot ( 1967 ) , luc simon in lancelot du lac ( 1974 ) , nicholas clay in excalibur ( 1981 ) , richard gere in first knight ( 1995 ) , sir loungelot in blazing dragons ( 1996–1998 ) , jeremy sheffield in merlin ( 1998 ) , phil cornwell in king arthur 's disasters ( 2005–2006 ) , thomas cousseau in kaamelott ( 2005–2009 ) , santiago cabrera in merlin ( 2008–2011 ) , christopher tavarez in avalon high ( 2010 ) , sinqua walls in once upon a time ( 2012 , 2015 ) , dan stevens in night at the museum : secret of the tomb ( 2014 ) , and martin mccreadie in transformers : the last knight ( 2017 ) , among others to seize the throne of dumnonia , lancelot conspires against arthur with guinevere , incites a christian rebellion , and defects to the invading saxons , ending up being hanged by his own half-brother galahad and by the narrator derfel ( who had lost his daughter to lancelot 's scheming ) as the mysterious dulaque ( a respelling of his name du lac ) , he leads the serpent brotherhood , a cult that has long opposed the library 's mission to keep magic out of the hands of humans
