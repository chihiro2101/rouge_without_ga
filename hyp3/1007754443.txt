its primary is an orange-hued giant star with a magnitude of 5.0 , 610 light-years from earth , and its secondary is a blue-white-hued star with a magnitude of 6.6 fk comae berenices , which varies from magnitude 8.14 to 8.33 over a period of 2.4 days , is the prototype for the fk comae berenices class of variable stars and the star in which the '' starspot '' was discovered w comae berenices ( or on 231 ) , a blazar in the constellation 's northwest , was originally designated a variable star and later found to be a bl lacertae object the coma cluster contains at least eight spectroscopic binary , and the constellation has seven eclipsing binary : cc , dd , ek , rw , rz , ss and ux comae berenices the bolivian poet , pedro shimose , makes coma berenices the home address of his '' señorita ngc 4565 '' in his poem '' carta a una estrella que vive en otra constelación '' ( '' letter to a star who lives in another constellation '' ) , included in his 1967 collection , '' sardonia '' ngc 4889 is a giant elliptical galaxy with one of the largest-known black holes ( 21 billion solar masses ) , and ngc 4921 is the cluster 's brightest spiral galaxy recent studies indicate that the interstellar gas in the galaxy 's outer regions rotates in the opposite direction from that in the inner regions , leading astronomers to believe that at least one satellite galaxy collided with it less than a billion years ago four ( sn 1940b , sn 1969h , sn 1987e and sn 1999gs ) were in the ngc 4725 galaxy , and another four were discovered in the m99 galaxy ( ngc 4254 ) : sn 1967h , sn 1972q , sn 1986i and sn 2014l m91 ( ngc 4548 ) , a barred spiral galaxy with a bright , diffuse nucleus , is the faintest object in messier 's catalog at magnitude 10.2 wasp-56 is a sun-like star of spectral type g6 and apparent magnitude 11.48 with a planet 0.6 the mass of jupiter that has a period of 4.6 days the coma star cluster represents berenice 's sacrificed tresses and as a naked eye object has been known since antiquity , appearing in ptolemy 's almagest it does n't have a messier or ngc designation , but is in the melotte catalogue of open clusters ( designated melotte 111 ) and is also catalogued as collinder 256 it is a large , diffuse open cluster of about 50 stars ranging between magnitudes five and ten , including several of coma berenices ' stars which are visible to the naked eye 21 comae berenices ( proper name kissin ) is a double star with nearly equal components and an orbital period of 26 years due to its great distance from earth ( 4.7 billion light-years ) , it was not visible to the naked eye and was discovered telescopically the coma supercluster , itself part of the coma filament , contains the coma and leo cluster of galaxies m85 ( ngc 4382 ) , considered elliptical or lenticular , is one of the cluster 's brighter members at magnitude nine it is one of the largest-known clusters , with at least 10,000 galaxies ( mainly elliptical , with a few spiral galaxies ) coma berenices contains the northern portion of the virgo cluster ( also known as the coma–virgo cluster ) , about 60 million light-years away fs comae berenices is a semi-regular variable , a red giant with a period of about two months whose magnitude varies between 6.1 and 5.3 american writer and folksinger richard fariña mentions coma berenices in his 1966 novel been down so long it looks like up to me , sardonically writing about content typical to upper-level astronomy coursework at cornell : '' it 's the advanced courses give you trouble the cluster is spread over a huge region ( more than five degrees across ) near gamma comae berenices
