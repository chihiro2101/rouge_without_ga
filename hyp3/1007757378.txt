bc after the deposition of the bad decemvirate ? why was a law banning marriage between patricians and plebeians drawn up by a body composed by both patricians and plebeians ( the majority of the members of the second decemvirate being plebeians ) ? cornell , t.j '' livy , the history of rome , 3.33.7 each day a different decemvir presided over the magistracy and this man had the twelve lictors ( the bodyguards of the consuls ) with fasces ( bound bundles of rods which were the symbol of supreme authority and sometimes had axes ) on hearing of the election of military tribunes at the aventine , icilius , thinking that these men would then be elected as plebeian tribunes and wanting to become one himself , arranged the election of the same number of '' military tribunes '' among these soldiers , who headed for rome , marched through the city and to the aventine ” they were similar to the names of the consuls for 509 bc , the year of the establishment of the roman republic ( publius valerius publicola and marcus horatius pulvillus ) they demanded the recovery of the protections the plebeians enjoyed through the plebeian tribunes and the right to appeal , immunity for those who incited the rebellion and harsh punishment for the decemviri the plebeian institutions were parallel and separate from that of the roman state ( the consuls , the senate and the two other popular assemblies ) forsythe sees similarities with the story of the decemviri , where the republican offices are suspended and replaced by the decemviri who were also tasked with drafting new laws , who then refused to leave office when their term was up , became tyrannical , were forced to resign by a secession and the republican offices were restored '' livy , the history of rome , 2.44.9 the main role of the plebeian institutions in the early days of the conflict of the orders was self-defence suetonius and dio cassius record that during the principate , caesar augustus transferred to the decemviri the presidency in the courts of the centumviri ( '' hundred men '' ) '' they also reinstated the principle of the sacrosanctity of the plebeian tribunes '' by restoring certain long-neglected ceremonies '' and by putting what had been just a religious sanction into the statutes with a law which extended it to all plebeian magistrates , including the aediles and the decemviral judges although disputed by historians such as niebuhr , cornell and grant , according to livy and dionysius , three envoys were sent to athens to study the law of solon and inquire about the laws of other greek city-states the decemviri stlitibus judicandis ( '' the ten men who judge lawsuits '' ) was a civil court of ancient origin ( traditionally attributed to king servius tullius ) mainly concerned with questions bearing on the status of individuals the republic was instituted with the overthrow of the last king of rome , who was a tyrant , in a rebellion and the decision to do away with the monarchy rather , they obtained the recognition of the institutions which they had created during the rebellion , the plebeian council ( an assembly restricted to plebeians where they could debate their issues ) cornell , the beginnings of rome , pp then '' they not only restored a consular law about the appeal , but they also safeguarded it for the future by the solemn enactment of a new law , that no one should declare the election of any magistrate without appeal , and that he who should so declare might be put to death by anyone without offence to law or religion , and that such a homicide should not be held a capital crime & nbsp ;

bc appius claudius was the victim of a later tradition of hostility towards the claudii , his family ( mommsen showed traces of this , but did not see it as a reason for rejecting the story ) ; the character of verginia bears similarities with that of lucretia , whose rape led to the overthrow of the monarchy ( ogilvie notes that in the original story might not have provided names and that she may have been referred to as ‘ a maiden ’ and the name verginia was ascribed to her later , but she did exist ) ; the story was the subject of a traditional ballade ” he also notes that the tradition of two decemvirates and the division of the tables into groups of ten and two were already around in the mid-second century bc they also introduced the practice of delivering the decrees of the senate to the aediles at the temple of ceres , “ up to that time they were wont to be suppressed or falsified , at the pleasure of the consuls & nbsp ; 266 in the early 5th century bc there was an increase in the problem of indebtedness due to the appropriation of public land ( ager publicus ) by the rich landowners to expand their estates ( which restricted the amount of land available to small farmers ) , rome 's territory being attacked by neighbouring peoples and taxation they formed a militia and reached peiraeus ( piraeus , the port of athens ) , defeated the forces sent by the thirty tyrants , and then forced them to abdicate and restored democracy the plebeians demanded that the state protect small farmers from the abuse of defaulting debtors by the creditors , who were the wealthy patrician landowners membership in this ecclesiastical college ( collegium ) was for life , and the college was increased to a quindecimvirate—that is , a college of fifteen members—and renamed accordingly ( see quindecimviri sacris faciundis ) in the last century of the republic , possibly by the dictator lucius cornelius sulla ; the dictator julius caesar added a sixteenth member , but this precedent was not followed because of the absence of clearly defined laws and judicial procedures , the creditors could imprison and torture the debtors and , sometimes , sell them as slaves the senate decreed the abdication of the decemviri , the election of the plebeian tribunes and the mentioned immunity livy , the history of rome , 3.33.3-5 the most influential member was appius claudius who , according to livy , '' was the guiding hand in the whole magistracy this led to the first secessio plebis ( 494 bc ) , which was the start of the conflict of the orders additionally , they specified that the heads of those who violated these ceremonies were to be forfeited to jupiter and their property sold at the temple of ceres , liber , and libera so was one of the consuls of the previous year ( 452 bc ) , publius sestius capitolinus vaticanus , because he had put the proposal to the senate despite the opposition of his colleague when they joined the other army , the twenty '' military tribunes '' appointed two men , marcus oppius and sextus manilius , to take command 273–274 the decemvirate 's role as a new magistracy which replaced the consuls and the plebeian tribunes has been interpreted being intended to reintegrate the plebeians into the roman state by doing away with the plebeian tribunes moreover , that the second decemvirate was elected because it was felt that two new tables were needed implies that the decemvirate was meant to be a temporary body for the duration of the drawing up of the laws an element of this conflict was about whether the resolutions of this council should be binding on all roman citizens , including the patricians , or only on the plebeians livy , 3.49-50 these soldiers , who were from the army which had been sent against the aequi , marched to rome and took possession of the aventine hill '' in addition , the plebeian council passed a law whereby those who left the plebeians without tribunes or elected a magistrate without appeal were to be scourged and beheaded some historians see the sharp contrast between the first , good decemvirate and the second , bad one as a legend to explain the twelve tables in general being good while the prohibition of marriage between patricians and plebeians was bad & nbsp ; 223–324 forsythe also says that the idea of the decemviri being overthrown “ might have been suggested to later roman historians by the names of the consuls for 449 & nbsp ; bc , lucius valerius potitus and marcus horatius barbatus '' before they left the city , the consuls had the decemviral laws , which are known as the twelve tables , engraved on bronze , and set them up in a public place & nbsp ; 223 cornell thinks that the story of the second decemvirate attracted much secondary elaboration ( later additions ) , that some of this at times romanticised it and that parts of the story are fictitious , but that it can not be proved the whole story was fictive and more convincing cases have to be made to support this view the reason why the first decemvirate had a dual role -- as a new magistracy which replaced the consuls and took on governance with extraordinary powers , and as a commission for compiling law -- is not explained by the sources if it had gone to athens , by that time the law of solon would have been replaced by the radical reforms of pericles in the first half of the 5th century bc '' the civilians who had come with verginius to the military camp claimed that the decemviri had been overthrown and that appius claudius had gone into exile and incited the soldiers to rise up
