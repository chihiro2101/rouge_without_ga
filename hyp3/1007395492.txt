in a letter to nature , written to refute an article saying that the draize test had not changed much since the 1940s , andrew huxley wrote : '' a substance expected from its chemical nature to be seriously painful must not be tested in this way ; the test is permissible only if the substance has already been shown not to cause pain when applied to skin , and in vitro pre-screening tests are recommended , such as a test on an isolated and perfused eye by draize 's retirement in 1963 , and despite never having personally attached his name to any technique , irritancy procedures were commonly known as '' the draize test '' to distinguish the target organ , the tests are now often referred to as '' the draize eye test '' and '' the draize skin test '' according to the british research defence society , the draize eye test is now a '' very mild test , '' in which small amounts of substances are used and are washed out of the eye at the first sign of irritation in addition , the use of human corneal cell line ( hce-t cells ) is also another good alternative method to test eye irritation on potential chemicals in september 2009 the oecd validated two alternatives to the draize eye test : the bovine cornea opacity test ( bcop ) and isolated chicken eye test ( ice ) harbell , '' ocular safety : a silent ( in vitro ) success story '' , atla 30 , supplement 2 , 69-74 , 2002 however , since 2000 oecd had validated alternative tests for corrosivity , meaning acids , bases and other corrosive substances are no longer required to be draize tested on animals this work culminated in a report by draize , his laboratory assistant , geoffrey woodard , and division chief , herbert calvery , describing how to assess acute , intermediate , and chronic exposure to cosmetics by applying compounds to the skin , penis , and eyes of rabbits the study found that none of the alternative tests , taken alone , proved to be a reliable replacement for the animal test , however a post hoc post-hoc analysis found that in certain combinations of tests , an '' excellent performance '' was observed positive results from some of these tests have been accepted by regulatory bodies , such as the british health and safety executive and us department of health and human services , without testing on live animals , but negative results ( no irritation ) required further in vivo testing '' in the draize test for skin irritancy , the test substances are applied to skin that is shaved and abraded ( several layers of skin are removed with sticky tape ) , then covered with plastic sheeting permission to carry out the test on several animals is given only if the test has been performed on a single animal and a period of 24 hours has been allowed for injury to become evident the test design requires that the substance be tested on one rabbit initially , and the effect of the substance on the skin must be ascertained before it can be introduced into the eye regulatory bodies have therefore begun to adopt a tiered testing strategy for skin and eye irritation , using alternatives to reduce draize testing of substances with the most severe effects it requires that the test solution 's '' physical and chemical properties are not such that a severe adverse reaction could be predicted '' ; therefore '' known corrosive substances or those with a high oxidation or reduction potential must not be tested in its 2006 guidelines , it '' strongly encourages '' in vitro screening of all compounds before testing on animals , and mandates the use of validated alternatives when available if a rabbit shows signs of '' severe pain '' or distress it must be immediately killed , the study terminated and the compound may not be tested on other animals the following year draize joined the fda , and was soon promoted to head of the dermal and ocular toxicity branch where he was charged with developing methods for testing the side effects of cosmetic products a 1995 study funded by the european commission and british home office evaluated these among nine potential replacements , including the hens ' egg chorioallantoic membrane ( het-cam ) assay and an epithelial model cultivated from human corneal cells , in comparison with draize test data he also reported that differences in anatomy and biochemistry between the rabbit and human eye indicate that testing substances on rabbits might not predict the effects on humans
