the result was a long string of fundamental breakthroughs , including '' thin airfoil theory '' ( 1920s ) , '' naca cowling '' ( 1930s ) , the '' naca airfoil '' series ( 1940s ) , and the '' area rule '' for supersonic aircraft ( 1950s ) it was modeled on similar national agencies found in europe : the french l'etablissement central de l'aérostation militaire in meudon ( now office national d'etudes et de recherches aerospatiales ) , the german aerodynamic laboratory of the university of göttingen , and the russian aerodynamic institute of koutchino ( replaced in 1918 with the central aerohydrodynamic institute , which is still in existence ) the purpose of the committee was '' to supervise and direct the scientific study of the problems of flight with a view to their practical solution , and to determine the problems which should be experimentally attacked and to discuss their solution and their application to practical questions '' although the bell x-1 was commissioned by the air force and flown by air force test pilot chuck yeager , when it exceeded mach 1 naca was officially in charge of the testing and development of the aircraft when engineers at a major engine manufacturer were having issues producing superchargers that would allow the boeing b-17 flying fortress to maintain power at high altitude , a team of engineers from naca solved the problems and created the standards and testing methods used to produce effective superchargers in the future naca ran the experiments and data collection , and the bulk of the research used to develop the aircraft came from naca engineer john stack , the head of naca 's compressibility division in the years immediately preceding world war ii , naca was involved in the development of several designs that served key roles in the war effort naca experience provided a powerful model for world war ii research , the postwar government laboratories , and naca 's successor , the nasa ( nasa ) the x-1 program was first envisioned in 1944 when a former naca engineer working for bell aircraft was previously head of the high speed wind tunnel division , which itself had nearly a decade of high speed test data by that time from engineering science to big science : the naca and nasa collier trophy p.147 the most important design resulting from the area rule was the b-58 hustler , which was already in development at the time from engineering science to big science : the naca and nasa collier trophy research project winners , 1998 , p.89 in 1951 , naca engineer richard whitcomb determined the area rule that explained transonic flow over an aircraft naca was established by the federal government through enabling legislation as an emergency measure during world war i to promote industry , academic , and government coordination on war-related projects according to one source , '' the enabling legislation for the naca slipped through almost unnoticed as a rider attached to the naval appropriation bill , on march 3 , 1915 from engineering science to big science : the naca and nasa collier trophy research project winners , 1998 , p.147 this was the first us supersonic bomber , and was capable of mach 2 at a time when soviet fighters had only just attained that speed months earlier president woodrow wilson signed it into law the same day , thus formally creating the advisory committee for aeronautics , as it was called in the legislation , on the last day of the 63rd congress naca also participated in development of the first aircraft to fly to the '' edge of space '' , north american 's x-15
