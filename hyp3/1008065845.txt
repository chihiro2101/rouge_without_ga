the term performance poetry originates from an early press release describing the 1980s performance poet hedwig gorski , whose audio recordings achieved success on spoken word radio programs around the world gorski , an art school graduate , tried to come up with a term that would distinguish her text-based vocal performances from performance art , especially the work of performance artists , such as laurie anderson , who worked with music at that time performance poets relied more on the rhetorical and philosophical expression in their poetics than performance artists , who arose from the visual art genres of painting and sculpture the austin chronicle newspaper , printing gorski 's bi-weekly '' litera '' column , first published the term '' performance poetry '' to describe the work of gorski with composer d'jalma garnier iii as early as 1982 she began using the term , however , to describe a 1978 '' neo-verse drama '' and '' conceptual spoken poetry for five voices '' titled booby , mama ! that employs the cut-up method made popular by william burroughs and conceptual art methods the national endowment for the arts categorized performance art within the visual arts judging panels ; it originally placed performance poetry within the category of theater before correcting it to literature in the 21st century performance poetry with music peaked during the 1980s just as performance art peaked in the 1970s during that time , san francisco and new york were the centers for this type of activity ; however , austin , texas ( the third coast ) also had a thriving scene during the 1980s with a coterie of unique characters other performing writers in the robust literary scene of the austin area during that time when performance poetry turned into a school of poetry included pat littledog , eleanor crockett , jim ryan , chuck taylor , greg gauntner , albert huffstickler , w jewell deserves special mention as a transitional figure , younger than the aforementioned , and one not especially rooted in the beats like gorski who has strong connections to ginsberg , corso , gary snyder , and others as gorski often states , broadcast and technology surpass books in reaching mass audiences for poetry , and just as writing poetry for print made poetry a completely different artform since the invention of the book , audio '' mediums influence the way poets write just as they do painters and sculptors '' the public performance of poetry became generally restricted , at least in a european context , to the staging of plays in verse and occasionally , for example in the cases of the elizabethan madrigalists or robert burns , as texts for singing cobbing 's groups bird yak and konkrete canticle involved collaborative performance with other poets and musicians and were partly responsible for drawing a number of the poets of the british poetry revival into the performance arena first was the poetry reading , at which poems that had been written for the page were read to an audience , usually by the author this leaves three types of poetry performance : poems written specifically for performance on the jerome rothenberg model and poems like those of david antin that are composed during performance while ginsberg sang his blake songs with a harmonium , the original practitioner of this third and most popular type of performance poetry is hedwig gorski , who coined the term performance poetry to describe her work with music unlike the beats , ginsberg and kerouac , her poems were written for performance with music that was specifically composed for the poems that is the key to gorski 's performance poetry : the marriage of poetry to music written specifically to fit poems written for vocal performance documented in jast during an interview with robert creeley on tv , austin chronicle , and unlike antin and cormin , gorski never improvised text but wrote poetry only for performance while eschewing printed poetry , the rise to prominence of the language poets poets with their distrust of speech as a basis for poetry has , broadly speaking , meant that performance poetry went out of fashion with the avant-garde however , the increasing popularity of open mics , which allow '' unknown '' poets to take the stage and share their own work in 3- to 5-minute increments and of poetry slams has meant that performance poetry is now one of the most widespread forms of popular poetry even though the beats did not use the term '' performance poetry '' to categorize their work with music and audio recordings , the beats provided an immediate model for the work of hedwig gorski it is worth noting that gorski , who coined the term '' performance poetry '' to describe her poems written only for performance , recordings , and broadcast usually with her musical band east of eden band , is the only woman , besides patti smith , in this group of late twentieth-century innovators reviving oral poetry however , the emergence of performed poetry as a popular art form can probably be linked to allen ginsberg 's stunning performance at the albert hall in 1965 at the international poetry incarnation these developments were also connected to the emergence of the liverpool poets , which referred mainly to the poets roger mcgough , adrian henri and brian patten who fired up audiences across the uk in the 70s and then the likes of john hegley emerged in the 80s , influenced as much by stand-up comedy as a love for wordplay , creating the template for what became recognised as contemporary british performance poetry - a format still exemplified by the work of acts such as murray lachlan young , francesca beard and gerard mckeown shadowork , for instance , aims to 'disrupt and enrich the conventional regimes of author , book and audience ' by combining ( simple ) theatre movement with the full range of voice and stage in ways designed to draw deeper attention to the text british performance poetry continues to thrive at a grassroots level , with performances in pubs and theatres , as well as at arts festivals such as glastonbury and the edinburgh fringe
