the basic method of making margarine today consists of emulsifying a blend of oils and fats from vegetable and animal sources , which can be modified using fractionation , interesterification or hydrogenation , with skimmed milk which may be fermented or soured , salt , citric or lactic acid , chilling the mixture to solidify it , and working it to improve the texture canadian standard b.09.016 states that margarine shall be : '' an emulsion of fat , or water in fat , oil , or fat and oil that are not derived from milk and shall contain not less than 80 % fat and not less than 3300 iu of vitamin a and 530 iu of vitamin d in 1978 , an 80 % fat product called krona , made by churning a blend of dairy cream and vegetable oils , was introduced in europe and , in 1982 , a blend of cream and vegetable oils called clover was introduced in the uk by the milk marketing board in the mid-1960s , the introduction of two lower-fat blends of butter oil and vegetable oils in scandinavia , called lätt & lagom and bregott , clouded the issue of what should be called '' margarine '' and began the debate that led to the introduction of the term '' spread '' the great depression , followed by rationing in america and the united kingdom , among other countries , during world war ii , led to a reduction in supply of animal fat and butter , and , by 1945 , '' original '' margarine had almost completely disappeared from the market in the united states , problems with supply , coupled with changes in legislation , caused manufacturers to switch almost completely to vegetable oils and fats ( oleomargarine ) by 1950 , and the industry was ready for an era of product development margarine originated with the discovery by french chemist michel eugène chevreul in 1813 of margaric acid ( itself named after the pearly deposits of the fatty acid from greek or μάργαρον ( margaritēs / márgaron ) , meaning pearl-oyster or pearl , or ( margarís ) , meaning palm-tree , hence the relevance to palmitic acid ) '' and margarine : '' to avoid any possible confusion , the regulation limits the use of the terms '' butter '' and '' margarine '' to products with a fat content of not less than 80 % some , such as hemp ( 60 % ) and the common margarine oils corn ( 60 % ) , cottonseed ( 50 % ) and sunflower ( 50 % ) , have large amounts , but most temperate oil seeds have over 10 % la nevertheless , bootleg margarine was produced in the neighboring dominion of newfoundland from whale , seal , and fish oil by the newfoundland butter company and was smuggled to canada where it was widely sold for half the price of butter several large studies have indicated a link between consumption of high amounts of trans fat and coronary heart disease , and possibly some other diseases , the nurses ' health study ( nhs ) prompting a number of government health agencies across the world to recommend that the intake of trans fats be minimized the competition between the major producers was given further impetus with the beginning of commercial television advertising in 1955 and , throughout the 1950s and 1960s , competing companies vied with each other to produce the margarine that tasted most like butter the vegetable oil and cream spread i ca n't believe it 's not butter ! was introduced into the united states in 1981 , and in the united kingdom and canada in 1991 shortages in beef fat supply combined with advances by boyce and sabatier in the hydrogenation of plant materials soon accelerated the use of bradley 's method , and between 1900 and 1920 commercial oleomargarine was produced from a combination of animal fats and hardened and unhardened vegetable oils the roles of butter and traditional margarine ( 80 % fat ) are similar with respect to their energy content , but low-fat margarines and spreads are also widely available in a 100-gram reference amount , margarine & ndash ; manufactured from soybean oil and pasteurized & ndash ; provides 628 calories and is composed of 70 % fat , 2 % carbohydrates , 26 % water , and negligible protein ( table ) in several states , legislatures enacted laws to require margarine manufacturers to add pink colorings to make the product look unpalatable , despite the objections of the oleo manufacturers that butter dairies themselves added annatto to their product to imitate the yellow of mid-summer butter margarines and vegetable fat spreads found in the market can range from 10 % to 90 % fat , depending on dietary marketing and purpose ( spreading , cooking or baking ) in 1950 , as a result of a court ruling giving provinces the right to regulate the product , rules were implemented in much of canada regarding margarine 's color , requiring that it be bright yellow or orange in some provinces or colorless in others under european union directives , distinguishes between spreadable fats : '' a water-in-oil emulsion derived from vegetable/animal fats , with a fat content of at least 10 % but less than 90 % , that remain solid at a temperature of 20°c and are suitable as spread '' in 2007 , health canada released an updated version of the canada 's food guide that recommended canadians choose '' soft '' margarine spreads that are low in saturated and trans fats and limit traditional '' hard '' margarines , butter , lard , and shortening in their diets liquid oils ( canola , sunflower oil ) tend to be on the low end , while tropical oils ( coconut oil , palm oil ) and fully hardened ( hydrogenated ) oils are at the high end of the scale voluntary fortification of margarine with vitamins had been practiced by manufacturers since 1925 , but in 1940 with the advent of the war , certain governments took action to safeguard the nutritional status of their nations by making the addition of vitamin a and d compulsory first made in france in 1869 , it was created by hippolyte mège-mouriès in response to a challenge by emperor napoleon iii to create a butter substitute from beef tallow for the armed forces and lower classes the long-running battle between the margarine and dairy lobbies continued : in the united states , the great depression brought a renewed wave of pro-dairy legislation ; the second world war , a swing back to margarine the reference margarine was rich in vitamin e ( 37 % of the daily value , dv ) , containing 35 & nbsp ; mg gamma-tocopherol ) and sodium ( 47 % dv ) added as salt for flavor in the united states , for example , in 1930 , the average person ate over of butter a year and just over of margarine the water-soluble additives are added to the water or milk mixture , and emulsifiers such as lecithin are added to help disperse the water phase evenly throughout the oil small amounts of ala are found in vegetable oils such as soybean oil ( 7 % ) , canola oil ( 7 % ) and wheat germ oil ( 5 % ) the law , '' to prevent deception in sales of butter , '' required retailers to provide customers with a slip of paper that identified the '' imitation '' product as margarine if hydrogenation is incomplete ( partial hardening ) , the relatively high temperatures used in the hydrogenation process tend to flip some of the carbon-carbon double bonds into the '' trans '' form butter-colored margarine was sold from its introduction in australia , but dairy and associated industries lobbied governments strongly in a ( vain ) attempt to have them change its color , or banned altogether the addition of hydrogen to the unsaturated bonds ( alkenic double c c bonds ) results in saturated c-c bonds , effectively increasing the melting point of the oil and thus '' hardening '' it post-war , the margarine lobby gained power and , little by little , the main margarine restrictions were lifted , the most recent states to do so being minnesota in 1963 and wisconsin in 1967 the united states food and drug administration ordered that trans fat is to be eliminated from food processing after a three-year grace period beginning in june 2015 , to then be implemented by june 18 , 2018 by the late 19th century , some 37 companies were manufacturing margarine in opposition to the butter industry , which protested and lobbied for government intervention , eventually leading to the 1886 margarine act imposing punitive fees against margarine manufacturers with the coming of world war i , margarine consumption increased enormously , even in countries away from the front , such as the united states if margarine were colored the same as butter , consumers would see it as being virtually the same thing as butter , and as a natural product soft vegetable fat spreads , high in mono- or polyunsaturated fats , which are made from safflower , sunflower , soybean , cottonseed , rapeseed , or olive oil lois dowdle cobb ( 1889–1987 ) of atlanta , wife of the agricultural publisher cully cobb , led the move in the united states to lift the restrictions on margarine
