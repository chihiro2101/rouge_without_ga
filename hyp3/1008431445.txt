under pressure from the king , and '' startled '' at the suggested abdication , baldwin agreed to take further soundings on three options : edward and simpson marry and she become queen ( a royal marriage ) ; edward and simpson marry , but she not become queen , instead receiving some courtesy title ( a morganatic marriage ) ; or abdication for edward and any potential heirs he might father , allowing him to make any marital decisions without further constitutional implications the government of the irish free state , taking the opportunity presented by the crisis and in a major step towards irish head of state from 1936-1949 , passed an amendment to its constitution on 11 december to remove references to the crown and abolish the office of governor-general of the irish free state ; the king 's abdication was recognised a day later in the external relations act on 5 december , having in effect been told that he could not keep the throne and marry simpson , and having had his request to broadcast to the empire to explain '' his side of the story '' blocked on constitutional grounds , the duke of windsor , pp the courts could not grant a collaborative divorce ( a dissolution of marriage consented to by both parties ) , and so the case was being handled as if it were an undefended at-fault divorce brought against ernest simpson , with wallis simpson as the innocent , injured party this was duly given by the parliament of australia , which was at the time in session , and by the governments of canada , south africa , and new zealand , whose parliaments were in recess following simpson 's divorce hearing on 27 october 1936 , her solicitor , theodore goddard , became concerned that there would be a '' patriotic '' citizen 's intervention ( a legal device to block the divorce ) , and that such an intervention would be successful colin matthew ( september 2004 ;

prince henry , duke of gloucester ; and prince george , duke of kent in an article for the new york daily news and chicago tribune of 13 december 1966 the duke wrote that in 1937 hitler persuaded him '' it was in britain 's interest and in europe 's too , that germany be encouraged to strike east and smash communism forever & nbsp ; the official address had been polished by churchill and was moderate in tone , speaking about edward 's inability to do his job '' as i would have wished '' without the support of '' the woman i love '' '' in the proposed speech , edward indicated his desire to remain on the throne or to be recalled to it if forced to abdicate , while marrying simpson morganatically comments like these reinforced the belief that the duke and duchess held nazi sympathies and the effect of the abdication crisis of 1936 was to force off the throne a man with extreme political opinions the divorce action would fail if the citizen 's intervention showed that the simpsons had colluded by , for example , connivance or staging the appearance of his adultery so that she could marry someone else
