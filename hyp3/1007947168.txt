the concept of diagramming originated in the 1797 book “ senbazuru orikata ” , the first origami book ever published these ranged from an unwieldy set of symbols to a photograph or sketch of each step attempting to show the motion of a fold this system caught the attention of samuel randlett and robert harbin , who added a few symbols such as “ rotate ” and “ zoom in ” , and then adopted it as the standard the yoshizawa–randlett system was first described in samuel randlett 's art of origami in 1961 reverse folds of a corner are typically used to produce feet or birds heads in origami , there is a series of several bases that many models are created with the kite base is merely two valley folds that bring two adjacent edges of the square together to lie on the square 's diagonal the waterbomb base consists of two perpendicular valley folds down the diagonals of the square and two perpendicular mountain folds down the center of the square the preliminary fold consists of two perpendicular diagonal mountain folds that bisect the corners of the square and two perpendicular valley folds that bisect the edges of the square it is sometimes called the square base the bird base , or crane base , consists of a preliminary fold with both the front and the back sides petal folded upward all four flaps are squash-folded ( the result is the same in either case ) , and then the corners are petal folded upward the swivel fold is difficult to describe as the term is loosely defined and there are so many different versions that could be called '' swivel folds '' however , generally swivel folds involve a flap of paper '' swivelling '' at a certain point or vertex and another flap or edge of paper , connected to the first , dragged around that point or vertex the open sink usually involves opening out the paper , and reversing creases to make a waterbomb base in the middle of the model instead of creating a long point to one side of the flap 's base , the spread squash creates a wide splat around the flap 's base the spread squash is used in the eyes of engel 's octopus , in marie 's rose , and in some other intermediate and complex models the twist fold involves , as the name implies , twisting a section of the paper with respect to its original position it is also possible to twist a single conical point indefinitely , collapsing the sides in a waterbomb-base-like fashion as one goes ( if this is tried with a non-conical point , such as the waterbomb base itself , eventually the fold will terminate in a spread squash however , it is easier to manipulate than an open unsink as there is an internal flap to pull to pop the unsink in place ; in an open unsink there is nothing to hold the following are books that happen to have detailed explanations of these techniques , and how the techniques are related to each other : robert j www.folds.net/tutorial folds.net guide to paperfolding – instructions on the web is laid out in a similar order to this tech tree
