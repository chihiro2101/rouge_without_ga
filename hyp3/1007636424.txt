these are the associate degree ( level 6 ) , which normally takes 2 years , the bachelor degree ( level 7 ) , which normally takes 3 years , the honours degree ( level 8 ) , which normally takes 1 year after the bachelor 's degree and is mostly taken as an optional extension year depending of the discipline , the master degree ( level 9 ) , which normally takes 1 – 2 years for '' research '' or '' coursework '' degrees and 3 – 4 years for an '' extended '' degree and follows on from either a bachelor or honours degree and the doctorate ( level 10 ) , which normally takes 3 – 4 years following on from a master 's degree or a class i or iia honours qualification ) ; either of these programs might be as long as three years in length ) and a further two to five years of coursework and research , culminating in '' comprehensive '' examinations in one or more fields , plus perhaps some teaching experience and then the writing of a dissertation for the doctorate , for a total of ten or more years from starting the bachelor 's degree ( which is usually begun around age 18 ) to the awarding of the doctorate in most cases , however , especially for the doctorate , the candidate is required to submit a research plan and one faculty member must agree to serve as his/her supervisor before the candidate can be admitted into the program ; the exception are the natural sciences post-graduate programs , that accepts students with very broad and/or vague research prospects with sometimes the prospect is given in promptu during the interview , preferring to let the students define their study program and advisor in the course of the first year of studies also included within the higher education system are graduate certificates and graduate diplomas , both of which are at level 8 ( honours degree level ) , as well as advanced diplomas , at level 6 ( associate degree level ) and diplomas at level 5 ( first year of a degree course ) finally , a small number of brazilian universities , most notably the public universities in the state of são paulo still award the title of livre-docente ( free docent ) , which is of higher standing than a doctorate and is obtained , similar to the german habilitation , by the submission of a second ( original or cumulative ) thesis and approval in a livre-docência examination that includes giving a public lecture before a panel of full professors the ordinary degree need not be in a specific subject , but can involve study across a range of subjects within ( and sometimes beyond ) the relevant faculty , in which case it may also be called a general degree ; if a third year or junior honours subject is included , the ordinary degree in that named discipline is awarded honours for ma or bachelor 's degrees are classified into three classes : first class honours second class honours , divided into : division one ( 2:1 ) upper second class honours division two ( 2:2 ) lower second class honours third class honours students who complete all the requirements for an honours degree , but do not receive sufficient merit to be awarded third-class honours may be awarded a special degree ( ordinary degree – bachelor 's level scqf level 9 ) additionally , whereas aspiring medical students are usually required to complete an undergraduate degree before applying to medical schools , quebec college graduates have the option to enter : a '' medical preparatory '' year at mcgill university or université de montréal and then pursue medical studies for the four following years ; directly into the undergraduate medical education program at université laval ( 4 to 5 years in duration ) or université de sherbrooke ( 4 years in duration ) requirements for an academic master 's degree include taking a minimum number of advanced graduate classes ( typically between five and eight ) and submitting a research thesis which is examined orally by a panel of at least two examiners ( three is the preferred number ) , sometimes including one external member who must be from another university or research institute the standard first degree for students studying arts or humanities in scotland is either a bachelor of arts or a master of arts ( the latter traditionally awarded by the ancient universities of scotland for a first degree in an arts/humanities subject ) in addition to these , the nzqf has certificates across levels 1 – 6 , diplomas at levels 5 and 6 , graduate certificates and graduate diplomas at level 7 ( bachelor 's ) and postgraduate certificates and postgraduate diplomas at level 8 ( honours ) the honours degree involves two years of study at a sub-honours level in which a range of subjects within the relevant faculty are studied and then two years of study at honours level which is specialised in a single field ( for example classics , history , chemistry , biology , etc the catholic university of america , the pontifical university of saint thomas aquinas , angelicum in rome , the university of louvain ( uclouvain ) in belgium and the pontifical catholic university of peru depend for their status as pontifical universities and for the nature of their academic degrees on the pope through the congregation for catholic education there are two types of post-graduate programs , lato sensu ( specialization and mbas ) and stricto sensu ( professional master 's , master 's and doctorate ) : specializations or mbas are courses that include taking a minimum number ( minimum 360 hours ) of graduate classes but with no need to do research nor defend a thesis , only present a final work showing the knowledge a similar option is offered for college nursing graduates as they can pursue their studies in university to obtain a bachelor of nursing in two years ( rather than the usual three or four years , depending on whether the student has completed a college diploma in quebec ) these programs are particularly interesting because they allow students to enter professional university programs , such as physiotherapy ( which consists of an integrated bachelor of science in physiotherapy and master of physical therapy ) , without having to meet the usual grade and course prerequisites required from students holding a pre-university science diploma in distinction to secular or catholic universities , which are academic institutions for the study and teaching of a broad range of disciplines , ecclesiastical or pontifical university '' are usually composed of three principal ecclesiastical faculties , theology , philosophy and canon law and at least one other faculty professional doctorates still require research leading to '' a significant and original contribution to knowledge in the context of professional practice '' and should not be confused with extended master 's degrees that bear similar names for historical reasons : the juris doctor and doctors of medical practice , physiotherapy , dentistry and optometry these are the bachelor 's degree ( level 7 ) , honours degree ( level 8 ) , master 's degree ( level 9 ) and the doctorate ( level 10 ) after high school , students progress to university , where they study for a técnico superior universitario ( associate degree ) or a licenciatura ( bachelor ) , then a maestría ( master ) , then a doctorado ( doctorate ) this timetable is only approximate , however , as students in accelerated programs can sometimes earn a bachelor 's degree in three years or , on the other hand , a particular dissertation project might take four or more years to complete studies like the 2011 learning gains study by arum and roksa , on the other hand , reported that only 55 % of students had any learning gains during their first two years of college , which favors the argument that investing in higher education may not still be worth it a 2015 survey of 2,000 adults ( 900 of which were graduates ) , implemented by an education technology company called greenwood hall , reported that more than half of the graduates surveyed believe those getting their degree now will be receiving a lower return on their investment than their counterparts 10–15 years ago outside quebec , three-year bachelor 's degrees are normally ordinary degrees , while four-year bachelor 's degrees are honours degrees ; an honours degree is normally needed for further study at the master 's level upon completion of a two-year pre-university program , such as in sciences or humanities , or a three-year technical program , such as nursing or computer science , college graduates obtain a college diploma , which is a prerequisite for access to university-level studies several mexican universities offer students the possibility of obtaining an equivalent to an associate degree , called in mexico técnico superior universitario ( tsu ) , studying only half of the licenciatura , with the possibility of finishing a full bachelor 's degree later pontifical university around the world such as the pontifical university , st patrick 's college , maynooth in ireland , the university of santo tomas in manila , the direct competence of the holy see applies only to the ecclesiastical faculties of theology , philosophy and canon the doctoral dissertation is examined in a final oral exam before a panel of at least two members ( in the state of são paulo the preferred number is five , while the other regions prefer three members ) , usually including one or two external examiners from another university or research institute the reason for this diversity is because some schools provide vocational education as part of their high school curriculum ( thereby allowing them to hand out '' technician '' titles ) while elsewhere , the student is required to decide whether to study sciences or humanities for the last two years of secondary school '' there are three cycles of degrees that constitute the core of degrees granted by pontifical universities : the first cycle leading to the baccalaureate degree ; the second cycle leading to the licentiate degree ; the third cycle leading to the doctorate they include awards such as advanced certificates , advanced graduate certificates , graduate diplomas , professional engineer status and professional diplomas , as well as specialist degrees such as education specialist , doctor of ministry , doctor of psychology and the licentiate in sacred theology the first one is called a '' '' ( professional career ) , which is similar to a bachelor 's degree requiring from four to 6 years of study according to the chosen program not all universities in scotland adhere to this , in some you study in several subjects within a faculty for three years and can then specialise in two areas and attain a joint honours degree in fourth year in the united states , since the late 19th century , the threefold degree system of bachelor , master and doctor has been in place , but has evolved into a slightly different pattern from the european equivalent department of education now classifies degrees in six categories : associate degrees , bachelor 's degrees , first professional degrees , master 's degrees , intermediate graduate qualifications and doctorates in chile , there 's a distinction between academic degrees and professional titles : is the denomination given to an academic degree granted by a higher education institution recognized by the chilean mineduc ( ministry of education ) however , the names given to qualifications at different levels are not the same and new zealand does not have associate degrees , thus only levels 7 – 10 correspond to academic degrees that contrasts with master 's thesis , which , in addition to being usually shorter than doctoral dissertations , are not required to include creation of new knowledge or revision/reinterpretation of older views/theories in most respects , the criteria for awarding qualifications at honours level and above are the same as in the rest of the uk ( see above under england , wales and northern ireland ) as academics continue researching and dissecting these arguments , education remains a hot topic in the us as shown by president obama recently setting a national goal for the us to once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world by 2020 postgraduate qualifications are not designated master of arts as in the rest of the uk , as this is an undergraduate degree the higher is a one-year qualification , as opposed to the two years of a-levels , which accounts for scottish honours degrees being a year longer than those in england
