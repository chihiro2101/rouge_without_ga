the f 1 fraction derives its name from the term '' fraction 1 '' and f o ( written as a subscript letter '' o '' , not '' zero '' ) derives its name from being the binding fraction for oligomycin , a type of naturally derived antibiotic that is able to inhibit the f o unit of atp synthase in the 1960s through the 1970s , paul boyer , a ucla professor , developed the binding change , or flip-flop , mechanism theory , which postulated that atp synthesis is dependent on a conformational change in atp synthase generated by rotation of the gamma subunit according to the current model of atp synthesis ( known as the alternating catalytic model ) , the transmembrane potential created by ( h+ ) proton cations supplied by the electron transport chain , drives the ( h+ ) proton cations from the intermembrane space through the membrane via the f o region of atp synthase the c-ring is tightly attached to the asymmetric central stalk ( consisting primarily of the gamma subunit ) , causing it to rotate within the alpha 3 beta 3 of f 1 causing the 3 catalytic nucleotide binding sites to go through a series of conformational changes that lead to atp synthesis large-enough quantities of atp cause it to create a transmembrane proton gradient , this is used by fermenting bacteria that do not have an electron transport chain , but rather hydrolyze atp to make a proton gradient , which they use to drive flagella and the transport of nutrients into the cell in respiring bacteria under physiological conditions , atp synthase , in general , runs in the opposite direction , creating atp while using the proton motive force created by the electron transfer chain as a source of energy the same process takes place in the mitochondria , where atp synthase is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane and the f 1 -part projects into the mitochondrial matrix however , whereas the f-atp synthase generates atp by utilising a proton gradient , the v-atpase generates a proton gradient at the expense of atp , generating ph values of as low as 1 both have roles dependent on the relative rotation of a macromolecule within the pore ; the dna helicases use the helical shape of dna to drive their motion along the dna molecule and to detect supercoiling , whereas the α 3 β 3 hexamer uses the conformational changes through the rotation of the γ subunit to drive an enzymatic reaction this link is tenuous , however , as the overall structure of flagellar motors is far more complex than that of the f o particle and the ring with about 30 rotating proteins is far larger than the 10 , 11 , or 14 helical proteins in the f o complex the modular evolution theory for the origin of atp synthase suggests that two subunits with independent function , a dna helicase with atpase activity and a motor , were able to bind , and the rotation of the motor drove the atpase activity of the helicase in reverse the enzyme is integrated into thylakoid membrane ; the cf 1 -part sticks into stroma , where dark reactions of photosynthesis ( also called the light-independent reactions or the calvin cycle ) and atp synthesis take place
