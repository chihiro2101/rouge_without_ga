charles darwin first suggested a possible evolutionary explanation of beards in his work the descent of man , which hypothesized that the process of sexual selection may have led to beards modern biologists have reaffirmed the role of sexual selection in the evolution of beards , concluding that there is evidence that a majority of women find men with beards more attractive than men without beards some scholars assert that it is not yet established whether the sexual selection leading to beards is rooted in attractiveness ( inter-sexual selection ) or dominance ( intra-sexual selection ) the presence of a beard makes the male vulnerable in hand-to-hand fights ( it provides an easy way to grab and hold the opponent 's head ) , which is costly , so biologists have speculated that there must be other evolutionary benefits that outweigh that drawback the red sox used their beards as a marketing tool , offering a dollar beard night , where all fans with beards ( real or fake ) could buy a ticket for 1.00 ; and also as means of fostering team camaraderie if only the area above the upper lip is left unshaven , the resulting facial hairstyle is known as a moustache ; if hair is left only on the chin , the style is a goatee full : downward flowing beard with either a styled or integrated moustache garibaldi : wide , full beard with rounded bottom and integrated moustache old dutch : a large , long beard , connected by sideburns , that flares outward in width at the bottom , without a mustache neard , a portmanteau of '' neck '' and '' beard '' ) : similar to the chinstrap , but with the chin and jawline shaven , leaving hair to grow only on the neck while never as popular as other beard styles , a few noted historical figures have worn this type of beard , such as nero , horace greeley , henry david thoreau , william empson , peter cooper , moses mendelssohn , richard wagner , and michael costa monkey tail : a van dyke as viewed from one side , and a lincoln plus moustache as viewed from the other , giving the impression that a monkey 's tail stretches from an ear down to the chin and around one 's mouth verdi : a short beard with a rounded bottom and slightly shaven cheeks with a prominent moustache muslim beard : full beard with the moustache trimmed soul patch : a small beard just below the lower lip and above the chin glitter beard : beard dipped in glitter normally , the turkey 's beard remains flat and may be hidden under other feathers , but when the bird is displaying , the beard becomes erect and protrudes several centimetres from the breast sometimes a beard of hair on the chin or face is prominent but for some others , '' beard '' may refer to a pattern or colouring of the pelage reminiscent of a beard reginald reynolds : beards : their social standing , religious involvements , decorative possibilities , and value in offence and defence through the ages ( doubleday , 1949 ) helen bunkin , randall williams : beards , beards , beards ( hunter & cyr , 2000 ) allan peterkin : one thousand beards
