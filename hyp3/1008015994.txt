interest rates vary according to : the government 's directives to the central bank to accomplish the government 's goals the currency of the principal sum lent or borrowed the term to maturity of the investment the perceived default probability of the borrower supply and demand in the market the amount of collateral special features like call provisions reserve requirements compensating balance as well as other factors the amount of interest payment depends on the interest rate and the amount of capital they deposited the annual equivalent rate ( aer ) , also called the effective annual rate , is used to help consumers compare products with different compounding frequencies on a common basis , but does not account for fees for an interest-bearing security , coupon rate is the ratio of the annual coupon amount ( the coupon paid per year ) per unit of par value , whereas current yield is the ratio of the annual coupon divided by its current market price yield to maturity is a bond 's expected internal rate of return , assuming it will be held to maturity , that is , the discount rate which equates all remaining cash flows to the investor ( all remaining coupons and repayment of the par value at maturity ) with the current market price however , a low interest rate as a macro-economic policy can be risky and may lead to the creation of an economic bubble , in which large amounts of investments are poured into the real-estate market and stock market for example , the federal reserve federal funds rate in the united states has varied between about 0.25 % and 19 % from 1954 to 2008 , while the bank of england base rate varied between 0.5 % and 15 % from 1989 to 2009 , moneyextra.com interest rate history , have as much to do with determining the average rate of interest as competition itself , in so far as it exists not merely as an average , but rather as actual magnitude for example , suppose someone deposits 100 with a bank for 1 year , and they receive interest of 10 ( before tax ) , so at the end of the year , their balance is 110 ( before tax ) in this case , regardless of the rate of inflation , the nominal interest rate is 10 % per annum ( before tax ) the repayment of principal plus interest is measured in real terms compared against the buying power of the amount at the time it was borrowed , lent , deposited or invested if inflation is 10 % , then the 110 in the account at the end of the year has the same purchasing power ( that is , buys the same amount ) as the 100 had a year ago the real interest rate is given by the fisher equation : : r \frac the formulae in this article are exact if logarithmic units are used for relative changes , or equivalently if logarithms of indices are used in place of rates , and hold even for large relative changes given the alternative of holding cash , and thus earning 0 % , rather than lending it out , profit-seeking lenders will not lend below 0 % , as that will guarantee a loss , and a bank offering a negative deposit rate will find few takers , as savers will instead hold cash a negative interest rate can be described ( as by gesell ) as a '' tax on holding money '' ; he proposed it as the freigeld ( free money ) component of his freiwirtschaft ( free economy ) system along similar lines , john maynard keynes approvingly cited the idea of a carrying tax on money , ( 1936 , the general theory of employment , interest and money ) but dismissed it due to administrative difficulties it has been proposed that a negative interest rate can in principle be levied on existing paper currency via a serial number lottery , such as randomly choosing a number 0 through 9 and declaring that notes whose serial number end in that digit are worthless , yielding an average 10 % loss of paper cash holdings to hoarders ; a drawn two-digit number could match the last two digits on the note for a 1 % loss in july 2009 , sweden 's central bank , the riksbank , set its policy repo rate , the interest rate on its one-week deposit facility , at 0.25 % , at the same time as setting its overnight deposit rate at âˆ’0.25 % for practical purposes , investors and academics typically view the yields on government or quasi-government bonds guaranteed by a small number of the most creditworthy governments ( uk , usa , switzerland , eu , japan ) to effectively have negligible default risk
