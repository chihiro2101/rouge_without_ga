nothing is known of his life except that his family was poor and undistinguished , and that he owed everything to sextus pompeius ( consul ad 14 ) , h j rose , a handbook of latin literature ( london 1966 ) p pompeius was the center of a literary circle to which ovid belonged ; he was also an intimate friend of the most literary prince of the imperial family , germanicus although he shared the same name as a prestigious family of the republic , john briscoe says '' it is unlikely in the extreme '' that valerius maximus belonged to the patrician valerii maximi he suggests instead that he was either a descendant of the plebeian valerii tappones or triarii , or earned the roman citizenship thanks to the patronage of a valerius of the republic his attitude towards the imperial household is controversial : he has been represented as a mean flatterer of tiberius , h nettleship , a dictionary of classical antiquities ( london 1891 ) p chisholm in 1911 argued however that , if the references to the imperial administration are carefully scanned , they will be seen to be extravagant neither in kind nor in number : few will now grudge tiberius , when his whole action as a ruler is taken into account , such a title as salutaris princeps , which seemed to a former generation a specimen of shameless adulation the style of valerius 's writings seems to indicate that he was a professional rhetorician ; and his writing represents much of the worst rhetorical tendencies of the silver latin age in his preface , valerius intimates that his work is intended as a commonplace book of historical anecdotes for use in the schools of rhetoric , where the pupils were trained in the art of embellishing speeches by references to history according to the manuscripts , its title is factorum ac dictorum memorabilium libri ix ( shorter title facta et dicta memorabilia ) , '' nine books of memorable deeds and sayings '' the stories are loosely and irregularly arranged , each book being divided into sections , and each section bearing as its title the topic , most commonly some virtue or vice , or some merit or demerit , which the stories in the section are intended to illustrate 664 valerius 's treatment of his material is careless and inaccurate in the extreme ; h j rose , a handbook of latin literature ( london 1966 ) p 356 but in spite of his confusions , contradictions and anachronisms , the excerpts are apt illustrations , from the rhetorician 's point of view , of the circumstance or quality they were intended to illustrate he often used sources now lost , and where he touches on his own time he affords us some glimpses of the much debated and very imperfectly recorded reign of tiberius ; as well as some fragmentary information on hellenistic art ; j boardman ed , the oxford history of the classical world ( 1986 ) p the collection of valerius was much used for school purposes , and its popularity in the middle ages is attested by the large number of manuscripts in which it has been preserved : indeed , b 1 like other schoolbooks it was epitomised : one complete epitome , probably of the 4th or 5th century , bearing the name of julius paris , has come down to us ; also a portion of another by martin bloomer , valerius maximus and the rhetoric of the new nobility ( chapel hill , 1992 ) , clive skidmore , practical ethics for roman gentlemen : the work of valerius maximus ( exeter , 1996 ) , and hans-friedrich mueller , roman religion in valerius maximus ( london , 2002 ) 129-133 , 2003 , amsterdam university press , , 9789053566091 600 manuscripts of valerius have survived , 800 when counting epitomes , more than any other latin prose writer after the grammarian priscian the three oldest manuscripts are the authoritative sources for the text : burgerbibliothek , bern , switzerland , n°366 ( manuscript a ) —— , valerius maximus , facta et dicta memorabilia , book 8 : text , introduction , and commentary , berlin/boston , de gruyter , 2019 works by valerius maximus at perseus digital library valeri maximi factorvm et dictorvm memorabilivm libri novem at the latin library , his most famous work , often quoted by orators of the time .
