'' the scientific objectives of the experiment fall into four areas including ( 1 ) measurement of the solar heating profile for studies of the thermal balance of titan ; ( 2 ) imaging and spectral reflection measurements of the surface for studies of the composition , topography , and physical processes which form the surface as well as for direct measurements of the wind profile during the descent ; ( 3 ) measurements of the brightness and degree of linear polarization of scattered sunlight including the solar aureole together with measurements of the extinction optical depth of the aerosols as a function of wavelength and altitude to study the size , shape , vertical distribution , optical properties , sources and sinks of aerosols in titan â€™ s atmosphere ; and ( 4 ) measurements of the spectrum of downward solar flux to study the composition of the atmosphere , especially the mixing ratio profile of methane throughout the descent since huygens was too small to transmit directly to earth , it was designed to transmit the telemetry data obtained while descending through titan 's atmosphere to cassini by radio , which would in turn relay it to earth using its large diameter main antenna huygens entered the upper layer of titan 's atmosphere 2.7 & nbsp ; hours after the end of the transit of the earth , or only one or two minutes after the end of the transit of the moon the instrument was designed so that if the surface were liquid , the sounder would measure the speed of sound in the '' ocean '' and possibly also the subsurface structure ( depth ) this was because under the original flight plan , when huygens was to descend to titan , it would have accelerated relative to cassini , causing the doppler shift of its signal to vary esa announced that the error was a mistake on their part , the missing command was part of a command sequence developed by esa for the huygens mission , and that it was executed by cassini as delivered the probe was designed so that in the event of a landing on a liquid surface , its motion due to waves would also have been measurable however , the firmware failed to take into account that the doppler shift would have changed not only the carrier frequency , but also the timing of the payload bits , coded by phase-shift keying at 8192 bits per second if the surface had been liquid , other sensors would also have measured its density , temperature , thermal conductivity , heat capacity , electrical properties ( permittivity and conductivity ) and refractive index ( using a critical angle refractometer ) this was done by measuring the force exerted on the instrument by the body 's surface as it broke through and was pushed down into the body by the landing the ssp contained a number of sensors designed to determine the physical properties of titan 's surface at the point of impact , whether the surface was solid or liquid just before landing a lamp was switched on to illuminate the surface , which enabled measurements of the surface reflectance at wavelengths which are completely blocked out by atmospheric methane absorption long after launch , a few persistent engineers discovered that the communication equipment on cassini had a potentially fatal design flaw , which would have caused the loss of all data transmitted by huygens during descent , measurements of the speed of sound gave information on atmospheric composition and temperature , and an accelerometer recorded the deceleration profile at impact , indicating the hardness and structure of the surface huygens was programmed to transmit telemetry and scientific data to the cassini orbiter for relay to earth using two redundant s-band radio systems , referred to as channel a and b , or chain a and b the mass spectrometer , a high-voltage quadrupole , collected data to build a model of the molecular masses of each gas , and a more powerful separation of molecular and isotopic species was accomplished by the gas chromatograph the hasi subsystem also contains a microphone , which was used to record any acoustic events during probe 's descent and landing ; this was the first time in history that audible sounds from another planetary body had been recorded the trace has an initial spike which suggests that the instrument hit one of the icy pebbles on the surface photographed by the disr camera a penetrometer instrument , that protruded past the bottom of the huygens descent module , was used to create a penetrometer trace as huygens landed on the surface the use of accelerometer sensors on huygens and vlbi tracking of the position of the huygens probe from earth allowed reasonably accurate wind speed and direction calculations to be made an acoustic sonar , activated during the last of the descent , continuously determined the distance to the surface , measuring the rate of descent and the surface roughness ( e.g
