because applying pre-existing words to new situations is a natural process of language change , looking at words ' etymology is helpful in determining polysemy but not the only solution ; as words become lost in etymology , what once was a useful distinction of meaning may no longer be so some apparently unrelated words share a common historical origin , however , so etymology is not an infallible test for polysemy , and dictionary writers also often defer to speakers ' intuitions to judge polysemy in cases where it contradicts etymology for example , the verb '' to get '' can mean '' procure '' ( i 'll get the drinks ) , '' become '' ( she got scared ) , '' understand '' ( i get it ) etc alan cruse identifies four types of linear polysemy : autohyponymy , where the basic sense leads to a specialised sense ( from '' drinking ( anything ) '' to '' drinking ( alcohol ) '' ) automeronymy , where the basic sense leads to a subpart sense ( from '' door ( whole structure ) '' to '' door ( panel ) '' ) autohyperonymy or autosuperordination , where the basic sense leads to a wider sense ( from '' ( female ) cow '' to '' cow ( of either sex ) '' ) autoholonymy , where the basic sense leads to a larger sense ( from '' leg ( thigh and calf ) '' to '' leg ( thigh , calf , knee and foot ) '' ) in non-linear polysemy , the original sense of a word is used figuratively to provide a different way of looking at the new subject alan cruse identifies three types of non-linear polysemy : metonymy , where one sense '' stands for '' another ( from '' hands ( body part ) '' to '' hands ( manual labourers ) '' ) metaphor , where there is a resemblance between senses ( from '' swallowing ( a pill ) '' to '' swallowing ( an argument ) '' ) other construals ( for example , from '' month ( of the year ) '' to '' month ( 30 days ) '' ) there are several tests for polysemy , but one of them is zeugma : if one word seems to exhibit zeugma when applied in different contexts , it is likely that the contexts bring out different polysemes of the same word if the two senses of the same word do not seem to fit , yet seem related , then it is likely that they are polysemous for example , check as in '' bank check '' ( or cheque ) , check in chess , and check meaning '' verification '' are considered homonyms , while they originated as a single word derived from chess in the 14th century psycholinguistic experiments have shown that homonyms and polysemes are represented differently within people 's mental lexicon : while the different meanings of homonyms ( which are semantically unrelated ) tend to interfere or compete with each other during comprehension , this does not usually occur for the polysemes that have semantically related meanings polysemy means that , '' each text is seen to generate a potentially infinite range of meanings , '' making , according to richard middleton , middleton , richard ( 1990/2002 ) charles fillmore and beryl atkins ' definition stipulates three elements : ( i ) the various senses of a polysemous word have a central origin , ( ii ) the links between these senses form a network , and ( iii ) understanding the 'inner ' one contributes to understanding of the 'outer ' one one group of polysemes are those in which a word meaning an activity , perhaps derived from a verb , acquires the meanings of those engaged in the activity , or perhaps the results of the activity , or the time or place in which the activity occurs or has occurred boy ) : ( as a verb ) to operate or constitute a vehicle or machine ( to man a ship ) this example shows the specific polysemy where the same word is used at different levels of a taxonomy 1200 , probably in old english but not attested in surviving documents , from a scandinavian source such as old norse banki , old danish banke '' sandbank , '' from proto-germanic bangkon '' slope , '' cognate with bankiz '' shelf '' ; book : a bound collection of pages : a text reproduced and distributed ( thus , someone who has read the same text on a computer has read the same book as someone who had the actual paper volume ) : to make an action or event a matter of record ( e.g a crude example of such a rule is the pastoral idea of '' verbizing one 's nouns '' : that certain nouns , used in certain contexts , can be converted into a verb , conveying a related meaning thus , the expression '' i am parked out back '' conveys the meaning of '' parked '' from '' car '' to the property of '' i possess a car '' this is supported by the morphology : '' we are parked out back '' does not mean that there are multiple cars ; rather , that there are multiple passengers ( having the property of being in possession of a car ) .
