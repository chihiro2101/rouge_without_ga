eastlake movement was named after the english architect charles locke eastlake ( nephew of charles lock eastlake ) following the release of his influential book ‘ hints on household taste in furniture , upholstery and other details ’ although eastlake 's book hints on household taste in furniture , upholstery and other details was originally released in england and was positively received , its influence was greater in the united states in the ‘ hints on household taste in furniture , upholstery and other details ’ book , eastlake promoted victorian style furniture which had opposed the curved features of the french baroque revival styles his quote “ i find american tradesmen continually advertising what they are pleased to call eastlake furniture , the production of which i have had nothing whatever to do , and for the taste of which i should be very sorry to be considered responsible ” shows his stance on this gay 's comment on eastlake having “ far reaching influence ” which could be compared to the best of america 's and europe 's manufacturers , manufacturers of cheap furniture began to use eastlake style whereas before little attention was paid to the appearance other eastlake features of the house include : “ the vertical stripes in the frieze , the brackets extending from the vertical strips , the narrow belt course , the cornice and brackets over the windows , and the wide band of trim under the cornice in england , eastlake was one of many who desired a design reform , but in america his simplicity and taste were exposed to “ unprecedented new readers the interior of the house reflects the eastlake style in the mantel spindles , the ornate tile work surrounding the two fireplaces , 12-foot second story coved ceilings and other details some exterior features of the house include ornamental details , such as “ sunburst pediments , a frieze of scrollwork sunbursts , dentil work in the gables , a mansard porch canopy , and a decorative balustrade with spindles and stick work many of the interior millwork were replaced during the hospital renovation in 1907 and in 1952 the dining room and kitchen were constructed in the style of that year this led to furniture manufacturers—who initially thought that eastlake 's ideas would be more harmful than good—to invent their own eastlake furniture , with it reaching a point that it was “ seen everywhere unlike manmade furniture , artists believed that machine-made furniture did not have holistic designs and “ had a basic form , a skeleton so to speak , to which various moldings and appendages of different styles were hastily applied it was known to be affordable while also being handcrafted and easy to clean which shows the transformative nature of eastlake 's ideas to furniture eastlake also believed that the prices of his furniture should be “ as cheap as that which is ugly ” as he could not understand why anyone would buy a more expensive piece of furniture for a more intricate design eastlake 's book led to a demand in eastlake furniture ; however , eastlake himself denied that there was an eastlake style the wallpapers , picture railings , period furnishings , and potted ferns are in the same style as the victorian features of the interior the entrance is decorated with spools , sunbursts , holes , buttons , brackets , scallops , and pierced cylinders , and is supported by large chamfered columns the exterior of this house has been shown , in one way or another , in all 178 episodes of charmed , through eight seasons , from 1999 & ndash ; 2006 the slant bays have side porches that extend to the back of the house and there is a rear hall that connects the house with a storage/laundry annex at the back of the property eastlake 's furniture was for the middle-class home , and being easy to clean was another one of the characteristics this influence later led to the eastlake movement in the united states where eastlake style furniture were being produced for the middle-class
