the straight keys used in wire telegraphy also had a shorting bar that closed the electrical circuit when the operator was not actively sending messages although occasionally included in later keys for reasons of tradition , the shorting bar is unnecessary for radio telegraphy , except as a convenience when tuning the transmitter the straight key is simple and reliable , but the rapid pumping action needed to send a string of dots ( or dits as most operators call them ) poses some significant drawbacks in the early days of telegraphy , a number of professional telegraphers developed a repetitive stress injury known as glass arm or telegrapher 's paralysis '' glass arm '' or '' telegrapher 's paralysis '' may be reduced or eliminated by increasing the side play of the straight key by loosening the adjustable trunnion screws from the mid-20th century electronic devices called '' keyers '' have been developed , operated by special keys of various designs generally categorized as single-paddle keys and '' iambic '' or double-paddle keys when the paddle is pressed to the right , it kicks a horizontal pendulum which then rocks against the contact points , sending a series of short pulses ( dits ) at a speed which is controlled by the position of the pendulum â€™ s weight when pressed to one side , the keyer electronics generate a series of '' dahs '' ; when pressed to the other side , a series of '' dits double-paddle keys have two arms , one for each contact , both arms held away from the common center by a spring ; pressing either of the paddles towards the center makes contact , the same as pressing a single-lever key to one side thumb using a keyer in what 's called '' iambic '' mode requires a key with two paddles : one paddle produces dits and the other produces dahs the operator can create a series of alternating dits and dahs ( similar to a sequence of iamb ( poetry ) ) by squeezing the levers together if the dah lever is closed first , then the first element will be a dah , so the string of elements will be similar to a sequence of trochees in poetry and the method could as logically be called '' trochaic keying '' insofar as iambic keying is a function of the electronic keyer , it is technically incorrect to refer to a dual paddle as an '' iambic '' paddle , although this has often been done for marketing purposes mode & nbsp ; a is the original iambic mode , in which alternate dots and dashes are produced as long as both paddles are depressed often , these were simple '' strap '' keys , in which a bend in the key lever provided the key 's spring action with straight keys , side-swipers , and , to an extent , bugs , each and every telegraphist has their own unique style and pattern when transmitting a message this had a huge significance in the world wars , as it could be used to track the location of individual ships and submarines and for traffic analysis however , electronic keyers ( single-paddle or iambic ) will produce '' perfect '' code at a set speed , thus only inter-character and inter-word spacing can produce a semblance of a fist .
