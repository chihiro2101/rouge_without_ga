traditionally , forging was performed by a smith using hammer and anvil , though introducing water power to the production and working of iron in the 12th century allowed the use of large trip hammers or power hammers that increased the amount and size of iron that could be produced and forged the smithy or forge has evolved over centuries to become a facility with engineered processes , production equipment , tooling , raw materials and products to meet the demands of modern industry considering all the costs that are incurred in a product 's life cycle from procurement to lead time to rework , and factoring in the costs of scrap , and downtime and other quality considerations , the long-term benefits of forgings can outweigh the short-term cost savings that castings or fabrications might offer in the case of hot forging , a high-temperature furnace ( sometimes referred to as the forge ) is required to heat ingots or billets owing to the size of the massive forging hammers and presses and the parts they can produce , as well as the dangers inherent in working with hot metal , a special building is frequently required to house the operation image : forgedconrodshowingetchedsection-s.jpg thumb upright a cross-section of a forged connecting rod that has been etched to show the grain flow there are many different kinds of forging processes available ; however , they can be grouped into three main classes : drawn out : length increases , cross-section decreases upset : length decreases , cross-section increases squeezed in closed compression dies : produces multidirectional flow common forging processes include : roll forging , swage , cogging , open-die forging , impression-die forging ( close die forging ) , press forging , cold forging automatic hot forging and upsetting all of the following forging processes can be performed at various temperatures ; however , they are generally classified by whether the metal temperature is above or below the recrystallization temperature if the temperature is above the material 's recrystallization temperature it is deemed hot forging ; if the temperature is below the material 's recrystallization temperature but above 30 % of the recrystallization temperature ( on an absolute scale ) it is deemed warm forging ; if below 30 % of the recrystallization temperature ( usually room temperature ) then it is deemed cold forging the main advantage of hot forging is that it can be done more quickly and precisely , and as the metal is deformed work hardening effects are negated by the recrystallization process drop forging is a forging process where a hammer is raised and then '' dropped '' onto the workpiece to deform it according to the shape of the die as the names imply , the difference is in the shape of the die , with the former not fully enclosing the workpiece , while the latter does open-die forging gets its name from the fact that the dies ( the surfaces that are in contact with the workpiece ) do not enclose the workpiece , allowing it to flow except where contacted by the dies 390 open-die forgings can be worked into shapes which include discs , hubs , blocks , shafts ( including step shafts or with flanges ) , sleeves , cylinders , flats , hexes , rounds , plate , and some custom shapes the flash cools more rapidly than the rest of the material ; this cool metal is stronger than the metal in the die , so it helps prevent more flash from forming in commercial impression-die forging , the workpiece is usually moved through a series of cavities in a die to get from an ingot to the final form the first impression is used to distribute the metal into the rough shape in accordance to the needs of later cavities ; this impression is called an '' edging '' , '' fullering '' , or '' bending '' impression if there is only a short run of parts to be done , then it may be more economical for the die to lack a final impression cavity and instead machine the final features barrelling occurs when , due to friction between the work piece and the die or punch , the work piece bulges at its centre in such a way as to resemble a barrel this leads to the central part of the work piece to come in contact with the sides of the die sooner than if there were no friction present , creating a much greater increase in the pressure required for the punch to finish the forging the dimensions across the parting plane are affected by the closure of the dies , and are therefore dependent on die wear and the thickness of the final flash
