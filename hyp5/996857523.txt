the outer body of the worm is composed of a cuticle with 3 main layers made up of collagen and other compounds which aid in protecting the nematodes while they are inside the digestive system of their host the human is the host ( biology ) , in which the parasitic worms attain sexual maturity , mate , and produce filarioidea the flies serve as host ( biology ) in which the microfilariae undergo part of their morphological development , and then are borne to the next definitive host after entering the human host , the larvae mature into adults , commonly in subcutaneous tissue usually , about 5 months are needed for larvae ( transferred from a fly ) to mature into adult worms , which they can only do inside the human body the most common display of infection is the localized allergic inflammations called calabar or cameroon swellings that signify the migration of the adult worm in the tissues away from the injection site by the vector these parasites have a diurnal periodicity in which they circulate in the peripheral blood during the daytime , but migrate to vascular parts of the lungs during the night , where they are considered noncirculatory the most visual sign of an adult worm infections is when the worm crosses the sclera of the eye , which causes significant pain to the host and is usually associated with inflammation and less likely , blindness other tissues in which this worm can be found includes : the penis , testes , nipples , bridge of the nose , kidneys , and heart travelers can be infected in less than 30 days after arriving in an affected area , although they are more likely to be infected whilst being bitten by multiple deerflies over the course of many months the main methods of diagnosis include the presence of microfilariae in the blood , the presence of a worm in the eye , and the presence of skin swellings due to the migration of microfilariae during the day , the accuracy of a blood test can be increased when samples are taken between 10 am and 2 pm dec is chosen over ivermectin because evidence supports its ability to kill both the adult worms and the microfilariae , which are the main cause of the severe neurological problems mentioned above reports of microfilaremia have been made in angola , benin , cameroon , central african republic , congo , the democratic republic of congo , equatorial guinea , gabon , nigeria , and sudan , and possibly rare cases in chad , ghana , guinea , liberia , uganda , and zambia of the 10 countries that have high rates of infection , about 40 % of the people who live in the area have reported being infected with the worm in the past the population in high-risk areas is about 14.4 million ; in addition , 15.2 million people live in areas where around 20â€“40 % of people admitted to having the worm in the past a study conducted by the research foundation in tropical diseases and environment in 2002 had a sample of 1458 persons , spanning 16 different villages , and found loa loa presence in these villages ranging from 2.22 to 19.23 % of the population in the western part of africa , an increase in prevalence has been associated with the distribution of ivermectin , which is used to prevent the infection of onchocerciasis , which is also very prevalent in the same region loa in nonendemic countries in the past 25 years reviewed 102 cases of imported loiasis , 61 of them from europe and 31 from the usa in the subjects viewed , peripheral blood microfilariae were detected 61.4 % of the time , eye worm migration 53.5 % of the time , and calabar swellings 41.6 % of the time
