at the time of the ariane 3 's maiden flight , the united states still held a majority of the global launcher market ; by the end of the year , the order books were shifting in favour of the ariane family , having outstanding orders to launch 30 satellites at a cumulative cost of €1 billion the ariane 3 's design heavily influenced that of its successor , the ariane 4 ; while the design team considered various approaches for achieving such a launcher , one of the studied concepts had involved the addition of a fifth engine to an enlarged first stage of the ariane 3 however , one new piece of infrastructure that was permitted was the establishment of tracking equipment in the ivory coast ; the existing infrastructure based in brazil used by the ariane 1 was less suitable due to the increased performance of the ariane 3 , which flew a different ascent profile that reached 250km , rather than 200km before coasting into orbit the principal agency behind the development of the ariane 3 was the centre national d'etudes spatiales ( cnes ) , while the lead company for its production was the french aerospace manufacturer aérospatiale the ariane 3 made its maiden flight on 4 august 1984 , almost two years before the ariane 2 's first launch , placing the ecs-2 and télécom 1a satellites into geosynchronous transfer orbit according to aerospace historian brian harvey , in spite of the numbering sequence adopted , the ariane 3 was the direct successor to the ariane 1 , rather than the ariane 2 , as could be logically assumed six years later , in december 1979 , the arrival of a capable european expendable launch system was marked when the first ariane 1 launcher was successfully launched from the guiana space centre at kourou , french guiana it was effectively an improved and developed derivative of the earlier ariane 3 , primarily differing through the application of various solid-fuelled and liquid-fuelled boosters , the latter being the only all-new design feature of the ariane 4 while the initiative was first proposed in 1978 , prior to the ariane 1 's first flight , approval to commence the first phase of development was not received until july 1979 the esa opted for a calculated risk on the first launch , saving €60 million , by performing a commercial launch with the very first flight of the ariane 3
