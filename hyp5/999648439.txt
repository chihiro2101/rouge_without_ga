specifically , aging is characterized as and thought to be caused by '' genomic instability , telomere attrition , epigenetic alterations , loss of proteostasis , deregulated nutrient sensing , mitochondrial dysfunction , cellular senescence , stem cell exhaustion , and altered intercellular communication oxford university press , usa , , the longest documented human lifespan is 122 years , the case of jeanne calment who according to records was born in 1875 and died in 1997 , whereas the maximum lifespan of a wildtype mouse , commonly used as a model in research on aging , is about three years genetic differences between humans and mice that may account for these different aging rates include differences in efficiency of dna repair , antioxidant defenses , energy metabolism , proteostasis maintenance , and recycling mechanisms such as autophagy widely recognized methods of extending maximum lifespan in model organisms such as nematodes , fruit flies , and mice include caloric restriction , gene manipulation , and administration of pharmaceuticals there are mixed reports that gh or igf-1 modulates the aging process in humans and about whether the direction of its effect is positive or negative the extension of life has been a desire of humanity and a mainstay motif in the history of scientific pursuits and ideas throughout history , from the sumerian epic of gilgamesh and the egyptian edwin smith papyrus , all the way through the taoists , ayurveda practitioners , alchemists , hygienists such as luigi cornaro , johann cohausen and christoph wilhelm hufeland , and philosophers such as francis bacon , rené descartes , benjamin franklin and nicolas condorcet however , the beginning of the modern period in this endeavor can be traced to the end of the 19th – beginning of the 20th century , to the so-called '' fin-de-siècle '' ( end of the century ) period , denoted as an '' end of an epoch '' and characterized by the rise of scientific optimism and therapeutic activism , entailing the pursuit of life extension ( or life-extensionism ) among the foremost researchers of life extension at this period were the nobel prize winning biologist elie metchnikoff ( 1845-1916 ) -- the author of the cell theory of immunity and vice director of institut pasteur in paris , and charles-édouard brown-séquard ( 1817-1894 ) -- the president of the french biological society and one of the founders of modern endocrinology robert boyle ( 1627–1691 ) , founding member of the royal society , also hoped that science would make substantial progress with life extension , according to hughes , and proposed such experiments as '' to replace the blood of the old with the blood of the young '' andrew zaleski , article in '' is there any truth to anti-aging schemes ?

transhumanism philosopher zoltan istvan , who proposes that the '' transhumanist must safeguard one 's own existence above all else '' ; futurist george dvorsky , who considers aging to be a problem that desperately needs to be solved ; and recording artist steve aoki , who has been called '' one of the most prolific campaigners for life extension '' university researchers have made a number of breakthroughs in extending the lives of mice and insects by reversing certain aspects of aging for example , leonard hayflick , who determined that fibroblasts are limited to around 50 & nbsp ; cell divisions , reasons that aging is an unavoidable consequence of entropy they aimed to provide political support to radical life extension research and technologies , and ensure the fastest possible and at the same time soft transition of society to the next step – life without aging and with radical life extension , and to provide access to such technologies to most currently living people this includes larry ellison ( founder of oracle ) , peter thiel ( former paypal ceo ) , veritas forum q & a with peter thiel on youtube larry page ( co-founder of google ) , and peter diamandis he states his opposition to life extension with the words : john harris , former editor-in-chief of the journal of medical ethics , argues that as long as life is worth living , according to the person himself , we have a powerful moral imperative to save the life and thus to develop and offer life extension therapies to those who want them in the fable , after a lengthy debate between those who believe the dragon is a fact of life and those who believe the dragon can and should be destroyed , the dragon is finally killed moreover , the philosopher and futurist max more argues that , given the fact the worldwide population growth rate is slowing down and is projected to eventually stabilize and begin falling , superlongevity would be unlikely to contribute to overpopulation one possibility for why 56 % of americans claim they would reject life extension treatments may be due to the cultural perception that living longer would result in a longer period of decrepitude , and that the elderly in our current society are unhealthy david sinclair says : '' i & nbsp ; do n't see aging as a disease , but as a collection of quite predictable diseases caused by the deterioration of the body '' one view is , this would stimulate pharmaceutical companies to develop life extension therapies and in the united states of america , it would also increase the regulation of the anti-aging market by the fda theoretically , extension of maximum lifespan in humans could be achieved by reducing the rate of aging damage by tissue engineering , molecular repair or rejuvenation of deteriorated cells and tissues , reversal of harmful epigenetic changes , or the enhancement of enzyme telomerase activity since 2009 , investigators have found ways to increase the lifespan of nematode worms and yeast by 10-fold ; the record in nematodes was achieved through genetic engineering and the extension in yeast by a combination of genetic engineering and caloric restriction a 2009 review of longevity research noted : '' extrapolation from worms to mammals is risky at best , and it can not be assumed that interventions will result in comparable life extension factors based on that research , there have been attempts to develop drugs that will have the same effect on the aging process as a caloric restriction diet , which are known as caloric restriction mimetic drugs hibbs suggested that certain repair machines might one day be reduced in size to the point that it would , in theory , be possible to ( as feynman put it ) '' swallow the doctor '' some life extensionists suggest that therapeutic cloning and stem cell research could one day provide a way to generate cells , body parts , or even entire bodies ( generally referred to as reproductive cloning ) that would be genetically identical to a prospective patient cryonics is the cryopreservation ( usually at of a human corpse , with the hope that resuscitation may be possible in the future sens proposes that rejuvenation may be obtained by removing aging damage via the use of stem cells and tissue engineering , telomere-lengthening machinery , allotopic expression of mitochondrial proteins , targeted ablation of cells , immunotherapy clearance , and novel lysosome hydrolases genome editing , in which nucleic acid polymers are delivered as a drug and are either expressed as proteins , interfere with the expression of proteins , or correct genetic mutations , has been proposed as a future strategy to prevent aging in july 2020 scientists , using public biological data on 1.75 m people with known lifespans overall , identify 10 genomic loci which appear to intrinsically influence healthspan , lifespan , and longevity – of which half have not been reported previously at genome-wide significance and most being associated with cardiovascular disease – and identify haem metabolism as a promising candidate for further research within the field therefore , to extend life , we should be able to prevent these genes from switching on , and we should be able to do so by '' identifying changes in the internal chemical environment of a body that take place during aging the basic idea is to scan the structure of a particular brain in detail , and then construct a software model of it that is so faithful to the original that , when run on appropriate hardware , it will behave in essentially the same way as the original brain the alleged benefits of the treatment , none of which have been demonstrated in a proper study , include a longer life , darker hair , better memory , better sleep , curing heart diseases , diabetes and alzheimer the approach is based on parabiosis studies such as irina conboy do on mice , but conboy says young blood does not reverse aging ( even in mice ) and that those who offer those treatments have misunderstood her research neuroscientist tony wyss-coray , who also studied blood exchanges on mice as recently as 2014 , said people offering those treatments are '' basically abusing people 's trust '' and that young blood treatments are '' the scientific equivalent of fake news ''
