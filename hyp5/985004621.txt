the kinetoplast is found closely associated with the basal body at the base of the flagellum and all species of trypanosomatid have a single nucleus modern terminology is derived from the greek ; '' mastig '' , meaning whip ( referring to the flagellum ) , and a prefix which indicates the location of the flagellum on the cell a variety of different morphological forms appear in the life cycles of trypanosomatids , distinguished mainly by the position , length and the cell body attachment of the flagellum three genera are dixenous ( two hosts in the life cycle ) – leishmania , phytomonas and trypanosoma and the remainder are monoxenous ( one host in the life cycle ) the three major human diseases caused by trypanosomatids are ; african trypanosomiasis ( sleeping sickness , caused by trypanosoma brucei and transmitted by tsetse fly ) , south american trypanosomiasis ( chagas disease , caused by trypanosoma cruzi and transmitted by triatomine bugs ) , and leishmaniasis ( a set of trypanosomal diseases caused by various species of leishmania transmitted by sandflies ) most of these morphologies can be found as a life cycle stage in all trypanosomatid genera however certain morphologies are particularly common in a particular genus the family is known from fossils of the extinct genus paleoleishmania preserved in burmese amber dating to the albian ( 100 mya ) and dominican amber from the burdigalian ( 20–15 mya ) of hispaniola in trypomastigotes the kinetoplast is near the posterior end of the body , and the flagellum lies attached to the cell body for most of its length by an undulating membrane the cell body is shown in orange and the flagellum is in red
