in 1942 , the university of ottawa 's english debating society published the inaugural edition of their newsletter , entitled the fulcrum the inclusion of advertising starting in its second year allowed the paper some slight financial freedom and the fulcrum continued in this manner until 1946 , when it came under the supervision of the english students ' association and the sfuo in 1947 , the fulcrum became a member of the canadian university press , a national cooperative linking student newspapers across canada throughout the 1950s , la rotonde and the university of ottawa administration had a combative relationship , inciting the canadian university press to label la rotonde as '' the most censored student newspaper in canada '' in 1956 the official reason for the cancellation of the fulcrum and la rotonde and the subsequent launch of id was a lack of student interest in both newspapers ; however , it was during this time that canada was enveloped in the polarizing events of the october crisis , and many attribute the climate on campus and cancellation of the opposing-language newspapers to these events in 1970 , both newspapers were re-instated and continued to publish regularly as services of the student federation of the university of ottawa ( which incorporated in 1969 ) the relationship between the university administration and both newspapers gradually became more distant during this time , and ( as the publisher of both papers ) the sfuo began to step in to moderate and control content when the sfuo felt it was needed beginning in the 2003-2004 school year , the paper began referring to itself as university of ottawa 's fulcrum , rather than the fulcrum , on the cover this push was spurred on by the sfuo attempting to pull the summer 2004 issue of the fulcrum for featuring a mug of beer and using the term '' frosh '' ( the sfuo had recently stopped using the term frosh in favour of welcome week and later 101 week due to negative connotations associated with the term ) in october 2004 , a letters patent was granted to '' the fulcrum publishing society '' , the corporation that would take over the governance of the fulcrum , and negotiations between the sfuo and the fulcrum continued throughout the year the fulcrum publishing society was set up to be governed by a ten-member board of directors made up of students , community members , fulcrum staff , u of o faculty , and fulcrum alumni recent changes to the governance structures of the corporation have led to slight changes , such as the business ( now general ) manager no longer being permitted to hold a seat on the board , and the roles of the corporation 's executives being clarified on the second vote , it passed by a vote of 93-85 , binding the fulcrum to cease accepting ads from the department of national defence as of may 1 , 2008
