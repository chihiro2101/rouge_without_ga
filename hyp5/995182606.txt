the discussion begins by considering the following logical argument : a : '' things that are equal to the same are equal to each other '' ( a euclidean relation ) b : '' the two sides of this triangle are things that are equal to the same '' therefore , z : '' the two sides of this triangle are equal to each other '' the tortoise asks achilles whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises , and achilles grants that it obviously does ) after writing down a , b , and z in his notebook , achilles asks the tortoise to accept the hypothetical : c : '' if a and b are true , z must be true '' the tortoise agrees to accept c , if achilles will write down what it has to accept in his notebook , making the new argument : a : '' things that are equal to the same are equal to each other '' b : '' the two sides of this triangle are things that are equal to the same '' c : '' if a and b are true , z must be true '' therefore , z : '' the two sides of this triangle are equal to each other '' but now that the tortoise accepts premise c , it still refuses to accept the expanded argument when achilles demands that '' if you accept a and b and c , you must accept z , '' the tortoise remarks that that 's another hypothetical proposition , and suggests even if it accepts c , it could still fail to conclude z if it did not see the truth of : d : '' if a and b and c are true , z must be true '' the tortoise continues to accept each hypothetical premise once achilles writes it down , but denies that the conclusion necessarily follows , since each time it denies the hypothetical that if all the premises written down so far are true , z must be true : or , in words : proposition p ( is true ) implies q ( is true ) , and given p , therefore q likewise , a formal system of logic consists of inference rules that are to be followed by the user of the system , and when a person reasons according to this formal system , he can not question or differ from these inference rules , but must instead abide by them because they form the very constituents of the system in this way , formalising logic as a system can be considered as a response to the problem of infinite regress : modus ponens is placed as a rule within the system , the validity of modus ponens is eschewed to without the system bertrand russell discussed the paradox briefly in ยง 38 of the principles of mathematics ( 1903 ) , distinguishing between implication ( associated with the form '' if p , then q '' ) , which he held to be a relation between unasserted propositions , and inference ( associated with the form '' p , therefore q '' ) , which he held to be a relation between asserted propositions ; having made this distinction , russell could deny that the tortoise 's attempt to treat inferring z from a and b as equivalent to , or dependent on , agreeing to the hypothetical '' if a and b are true , then z is true '' the wittgensteinian philosopher peter winch discussed the paradox in the idea of a social science and its relation to philosophy ( 1958 ) , where he argued that the paradox showed that '' the actual process of drawing an inference , which is after all at the heart of logic , is something which can not be represented as a logical formula winch goes on to suggest that the moral of the dialogue is a particular case of a general lesson , to the effect that the proper application of rules governing a form of human activity can not itself be summed up with a set of further rules , and so that '' a form of human activity can never be summed up in a set of explicit precepts '' ( p a number of websites , including '' what the tortoise said to achilles '' at digital text international , and '' what the tortoise said to achilles '' at fair use repository
