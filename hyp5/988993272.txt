) , the poet ’ s work : 29 poets on the origins and practice of their art ( chicago and london : university of chicago press , 1979 ) from two of the most fundamental tools in the poet 's toolbox—meter and rhyme—without necessarily knowing a lot of terminology , as in this , the first stanza of byron 's '' the destruction of sennacherib '' : : the assyrian came down like the wolf on the fold , : and his cohorts were gleaming in purple and gold ; : and the sheen of their spears was like stars on the sea , : when the blue wave rolls nightly on deep galilee in '' the destruction of sennacherib '' , each line has the basic pattern of two unstressed syllables followed by a third stressed syllable , with this basic pattern being repeated four times in a line the sound , the physical nature , of the language is also emphasized by alliteration , as in the repetition of s sounds in the third line : '' and the sheen of their spears was like stars on the sea '' this appearance , though , is deceptive : successful open form poems are informed throughout by organic structure which may resist formal description but is nonetheless a crucial element of the poem 's effect on the reading mind some designs have proven so durable and so suited to the english language that they survive for centuries and are renewed with each generation of poets ( sonnets , sestinas , limericks , and so forth ) , while others come into being for the expression of one poem and are then set aside ( frost 's '' stopping by woods on a snowy evening '' is a good example ) among the many exemplary works of blank verse in english are milton 's paradise lost and most of the verse passages from shakespeare 's plays , such as this portion of a famous soliloquy from hamlet : : to be , or not to be—that is the question : whether 't is nobler in the mind to suffer : the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune , : or to take arms against a sea of troubles : and by opposing end them to die , to sleep — : no more , and by a sleep to say we end : the heartache and the thousand natural shocks : that flesh is heir to : some few in that , but numbers err in this , : ten censure wrong for one who writes amiss ; : a fool might once himself alone expose , : now one in verse makes many more in prose for example , consider henry wadsworth longfellow 's '' the sound of the sea '' : : the sea awoke at midnight from its sleep , : and round the pebbly beaches far and wide : i heard the first wave of the rising tide : rush onward with uninterrupted sweep ; : a voice out of the silence of the deep , : a sound mysteriously multiplied : as of a cataract from the mountain 's side , : or roar of winds upon a wooded steep : so comes to us at times , from the unknown : and inaccessible solitudes of being , : the rushing of the sea-tides of the soul ; : and inspirations , that we deem our own , : are some divine foreshadowing and foreseeing : of things beyond our reason or control the poet using this , the english sonnet or shakespearean sonnet form , may use the fourteen lines as single unit of thought ( as in '' the silken tent '' above ) , or treat the groups of four rhyming lines ( the quatrains ) as organizational units , as in shakespeare 's sonnet 73 : : that time of year thou mayst in me behold : when yellow leaves , or none , or few do hang : upon those boughs which shake against the cold : bare ruined choirs where late the sweet birds sang at the '' low end '' are forms such as the limerick , which follows a metrical pattern of two lines of anapestic trimeter ( three anapests per line ) , followed by two lines of anapestic dimeter ( two anapests per line ) , followed by one line of anapestic trimeter most limericks are humorous , and many are ribald , or outright obscene ( possible rhymes that could follow an opening like '' there once was a man from nantucket '' are left as an exercise for the reader ) in contrast , a poet using free verse ( sometimes called '' open form '' ) seeks to find fresh and uniquely appropriate forms for each poem , letting the structure grow out of the poem 's subject matter or inspiration a common perception is that open form is easier and less rigorous than closed form ( frost likened it to '' playing tennis with the net down '' address at milton academy , massachusetts ( 17 may 1935 ) , but such is not necessarily the case ( skeptics should try playing tennis without a net ) : success with the open form requires great sensitivity to language and a particular type of adaptable understanding the metre of ‘ classical ’ poetry is replaced in open verse by cadence in rhythm , line indentation , with pauses implied by the syntax , thus the limiting factor of one human breath was naturally incorporated in the poetry , essential to an oral art form , composed to be read aloud : a noiseless patient spider , : i marked where on a little promontory it stood isolated , : marked how to explore the vacant vast surrounding , : it launched forth filament , filament , filament , out of itself , : ever unreeling them , ever tirelessly speeding them : and you o my soul where you stand , : surrounded , detached , in measureless oceans of space , : ceaselessly musing , venturing , throwing , seeking the spheres to connect them , : till the bridge you will need to be formed , till the ductile anchor hold , : till the gossamer thread you fling catch somewhere , o my soul in this poem , whitman uses synonyms and antonyms to give structural integrity to a poem comprising two yoked stanzas , much like ( but not exactly like ) the way poets working within closed forms use meter and rhyme to give structural integrity to their poems for example : '' another '' tells of a buried child ; '' the destruction of sennacherib '' tells of the annihilation of an assyrian army by divine intervention ; '' the silken tent '' compares a woman to a tent part of this involves recognising the voice of the poem ( who is speaking ) , and the rest of kipling 's just so stories : the events in the poem ; when these occur ; where is the 'speaker ' and where do the events occur ; why does the speaker speak ? william harmon has suggested that starting an analysis with : '' this poem dramatizes the conflict between the poem opens : : who sayes that fictions onely and false hair : become a verse ? is there in truth no beautie ? : is all good structure in a winding stair ? : may no lines passe , except they do their dutie : not to a true , but painted chair ? he was railing against the prevalent enthusiasm for pastoral poetry above all other forms ( as becomes apparent in subsequent verses ) it was particularly prevalent in seventeenth century english but a more recent example is charles williams ' the masque of the manuscript , in which the process of publishing is a metaphor for the search for truth for example , the word '' sheen '' in the destruction of sennacherib has stronger connotations of polishing , of human industry , than does the similar '' shine '' the terms for line length follow a regular pattern : a greek prefix denoting the number of feet and the root '' meter '' ( for '' measure '' ) : monometer , dimeter , trimeter , tetrameter , pentameter , hexameter , heptameter , and octameter ( lines having more than eight feet are possible but quite rare ) skillful poets structure their poems around a meter and line length , and then depart from it and play against it as needed in order to create effect , as robert browning does in the first line of '' my last duchess '' : : that 's my last duchess painted on the wall gerard manley hopkins took this idea of poetric energy through departure from meter to its extreme , with his theory and practice of sprung rhythm , an approach to poetry in which the language constantly frustrates the reading mind 's expectation of a regular meter eliot quickly sets a certain tone , and then creates effect by juxtaposing it with a very different tone : : let us go then , you and i , : when the evening is spread out against the sky : like a patient etherized upon a table to analyze the poem , the reader must first reassemble these into meaningful units : a brief , evocative image— '' a leaf falls '' —appearing , like an unbidden thought , in the middle of a word , '' loneliness '' a single falling leaf is by itself a fine image for the feeling of loneliness , but in order to fully experience the poem , the reader must then put the elements of language back into the visual form in which cummings arranged them : a vertical line ( like a leaf falling to the ground ) , followed by a horizontal series of letters ( like a leaf laying flat on the ground ) the vertical line is dominated by the word '' one '' ( an absolutely appropriate expression of loneliness ) and by the letter '' l '' ( which , on the page , looks like the numeral 1 numerous other poets , including george herbert , lewis carroll , william blake , wyndham lewis , and john hollander have used the layout of words , letters , and images on the page to create effect in their poems schools of poetry may be self-identified by the poets that form them ( such as imagism ) , or defined by critics who see unifying characteristics of a body of work by more than one poet ( for example the movement ) a commonality of form is not in itself sufficient to define a school ; for example , edward lear , george du maurier and ogden nash do not form a school simply because they all wrote limericks reception theory is a development of reader-response criticism that considers the public response to a literary work and suggests that this can inform analysis of cultural ideology at the time of the response all poetry was originally oral , it was sung or chanted ; poetic form as we know it is an abstraction therefrom when writing replaced memory as a way of preserving poetic utterances , but the ghost of oral poetry never vanishes poems that read aloud well include : '' the frog '' , by jean dao '' one art '' , by elizabeth bishop '' the tyger '' , by william blake '' meeting at night '' , by robert browning '' she walks in beauty '' , by byron '' the song of the western men '' , by robert stephen hawker '' november in england '' , by thomas hood '' dream variations '' , by langston hughes '' the ingoldsby legends '' , by thomas ingoldsby '' to put one brick upon another '' , by philip larkin '' paul revere 's ride '' , by henry wadsworth longfellow '' adventures of isabel '' , by ogden nash '' nothing but death '' , by pablo neruda translated by robert bly '' a small elegy '' , by jirí orten translated by lynn coffin '' ozymandias '' , by percy bysshe shelley '' the cat in the hat '' , by dr glossary of poetry terms the close reading of poetry : a practical introduction and guide to explication online poem analyzer appreciation of poem the planners poem appreciation , workshop of various classes
