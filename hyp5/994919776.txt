one of the images is referred to as the moving or source and the others are referred to as the target , fixed or sensed images image registration involves spatially transforming the source/moving image ( s ) to align with the target image knowing the correspondence between a number of points in images , a geometrical transformation is then determined to map the target image to the reference images , thereby establishing point-by-point correspondence between the reference and target images some of the feature matching algorithms are outgrowths of traditional techniques for performing manual image registration , in which an operator chooses corresponding control points ( cp ) in images unlike many spatial-domain algorithms , the phase correlation method is resilient to noise , occlusions , and other defects typical of medical or satellite images due to properties of the fourier transform , the rotation and scaling parameters can be determined in a manner invariant to translation multi-modality registration methods are often used in medical imaging as images of a subject are frequently obtained from different scanners examples include registration of brain ct/mri images or whole body pet/ct images for tumor localization , registration of contrast-enhanced ct images against non-contrast-enhanced ct images for segmentation of specific parts of the anatomy , and registration of ultrasound and ct images for prostate localization in radiotherapy in remote sensing applications where a digital image pixel may represent several kilometers of spatial distance ( such as nasa 's landsat imagery ) , an uncertain image registration can mean that a solution could be several kilometers from ground truth proceedings of ieee international conference on acoustics , speech , and signal processing , 2008 however , many approaches to quantifying uncertainty or estimating deformations are computationally intensive or are only applicable to limited sets of spatial transformations due to the vast range of applications to which image registration can be applied , it is impossible to develop a general method that is optimized for all uses medical image registration ( for data of the same patient taken at different points in time such as change detection or tumor monitoring ) often additionally involves elastic ( also known as nonrigid ) registration to cope with deformation of the subject ( due to breathing , anatomical changes , and so forth ) nonrigid registration of medical images can also be used to register a patient 's data to an anatomical atlas , such as the talairach atlas for neuroimaging using control points ( automatically or manually entered ) , the computer performs transformations on one image to make major features align with a second or multiple images this technique may also be used for images of different sizes , to allow images taken through different telescopes or lenses to be combined for low snr data , the best image registration is achieved by cross-correlating all permutations of images in an image stack
