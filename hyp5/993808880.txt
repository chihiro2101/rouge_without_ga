in this view , the apparent forces that seem to permit discrimination between relative and '' absolute '' motions should only be considered as an effect of the particular asymmetry that there is in our reference system between the bodies which we consider in motion , that are small ( like buckets ) , and the bodies that we believe are still ( the earth and distant stars ) , that are overwhelmingly bigger and heavier than the former this thought experiment demonstrates that the centrifugal forces arise only when the water is in rotation with respect to the absolute space ( represented here by the earth 's reference frame , or better , the distant stars ) instead , when the bucket was rotating with respect to the water no centrifugal forces were produced , this indicating that the latter was still with respect to the absolute space in such universes mach 's principle can be stated as the distribution of matter and field energy-momentum ( and possibly other information ) at a particular moment in the universe determines the inertial frame at each point in the universe ( where '' a particular moment in the universe '' refers to a chosen cauchy surface ) the writing in which einstein found inspiration from mach was '' the science of mechanics '' , where the philosopher criticized newton 's idea of absolute space , in particular the argument that newton gave sustaining the existence of an advantaged reference system : what is commonly called '' newton 's bucket argument '' if a bucket is filled with water , and made to rotate , initially the water remains still , but then , gradually , the walls of the vessel communicate their motion to the water , making it curve and climb up the borders of the bucket , because of the centrifugal forces produced by the rotation mach , in his book , says that the bucket experiment only demonstrates that when the water is in rotation with respect to the bucket no centrifugal forces are produced , and that we can not know how the water would behave if in the experiment the bucket 's walls were increased in depth and width until they became leagues big because intuitive notions of distance and time no longer apply , what exactly is meant by '' mach 's principle '' in general relativity is even less clear than in newtonian physics and at least 21 formulations of mach 's principle are possible , some being considered more strongly machian than others einstein was so satisfied with this manifestation of mach 's principle that he wrote a letter to mach expressing this : the lenseâ€“thirring effect certainly satisfies the very basic and broad notion that '' matter there influences inertia here '' this physical mechanism should determine the inertia of bodies , in a way that the heavy and distant bodies of our universe should contribute the most to the inertial forces in mach 's idea this concept of absolute motion should be substituted with a total relativism in which every motion , uniform or accelerated , has sense only in reference to other bodies ( i.e when we do this , einstein 's equations can be decomposed into one set of equations , which must be satisfied on each slice , and another set , which describe how to move between slices in general , this means that only part of the geometry of the slice can be given by the scientist , while the geometry everywhere else will then be dictated by einstein 's equations on the slice
