in the asc this was improved somewhat with a lookahead unit that predicted upcoming memory accesses and loaded them into the scalar registers invisibly , using a memory interface in the cpu called the memory buffer unit ( mbu ) the asc was based around a single high-speed shared memory , which was accessed by the cpu and eight i/o channel controllers , in an organization similar to seymour cray 's groundbreaking cdc 6600 although the asc was in some ways a more expandable design , in the supercomputer market speed is preferred , and the cray-1 was much faster asc sales ended almost overnight , and although an upgraded asc had been designed with a cycle time one-fifth that of the original , texas instruments decided to exit the market the cray-1 dedicated almost all of its design to sustained high-speed access to memory , including over one million 64-bit words of semiconductor memory and a cycle time that was one-fifth that of the asc ( 12.5 & nbsp ; ns ) the cpu could be have one , two , or four vector lanes , allowing the cpu to produce one to four vector results every cycle , depending on the number of vector lanes installed gsi was now a subsidiary of ti , and ti wanted to apply the latest computer technology to the processing and analysis of seismic datasets the vector processing facilities had a memory-to-memory architecture ; where the vector operands were read from , and the resulting vector written to , memory the '' peripheral processor '' was a separate system dedicated entirely to quickly running the operating system and programs running within it , as well as feeding data to the cpu the mcu was a two-way , 256-bit per channel parallel network that could support up to eight independent processors , with a ninth channel for accessing '' main memory '' ( referred to as '' extended memory '' ) the mcu also acted as a cache controller , offering high-speed access to a semiconductor-based memory for the eight processor ports , and handling all communications to the 24-bit address space in main memory
