57 in 1950 , the state department declared homosexuals to be security risks ( because of vulnerability to blackmail ) , and what followed was a succession of more repressive acts that included lavender scare ; politically motivated police raids on gay bar all over the us and canada ; even the enactment of laws prohibiting cross-dressing for men and women in 1955 , del martin and phyllis lyon had been together as lovers for three years when they complained to a gay male couple that they did not know any other lesbians martin and lyon recalled later , '' women needed privacy.not only from the watchful eye of the police , but from gaping tourists in the bars and from inquisitive parents and families within a year of its creation , most of the original eight participants were no longer part of the group , but their numbers had grown to 16 , and they decided they wanted to be more than only a social alternative to bars 149 soon after forming , the dob wrote a mission statement that addressed the most significant problem martin and lyon had faced as a couple : the complete lack of information about female homosexuality in what historian martin meeker termed '' the most fundamental journey a lesbian has to make 79 when the club realized they were not allowed to advertise their meetings in the local newspaper , lyon and martin , who both had backgrounds in journalism , began to print a newsletter to distribute to as many women as the group knew 426 the statement was composed of four parts that prioritized the purpose of the organization , and it was printed on the inside of the cover of every issue of the ladder until 1970 : education of the variant.to enable her to understand herself and make her adjustment to society.this to be accomplished by establishing.a library.on the sex deviant theme ; by sponsoring public discussions.to be conducted by leading members of the legal psychiatric , religious and other professions ; by advocating a mode of behavior and dress acceptable to society 24 barbara gittings recalled years later an instance when , in preparation for a national convention , members of the dob persuaded a woman who had worn men 's clothing all her life '' to deck herself out in as 'feminine ' a manner as she could to enlighten you as to the existence of a lesbian organization composed of homosexual women , make yourself acquainted with the name daughters of bilitis 150 even the fbi was curious enough to attend meetings to report in 1959 , '' the purpose of the dob is to educate the public to accept the lesbian homosexual into society press releases announcing the convention were sent to local radio and newspapers , prompting san francisco chronicle columnist herb caen to direct a jab at russell wolden and publicize the convention , writing : '' russ wolden , if no one else , will be interested to learn that the daughters of bilitis will hold their nat ' l convention here may 27–30 two hundred women attended the conference , as did the san francisco police , who came to check if any of the dob members were wearing men 's clothes 62-63 the attendees listened to speakers , including a debate between two attorneys about the legality and morality of gay bars , a presentation by the american civil liberties union , and an episcopal priest who '' served up damnation with dessert '' , sanders , helen 63-65 the dob also gave awards to men who were allied with them , whom they called '' sons of bilitis '' , or sobs , including their lawyer , photographer , and members of the mattachine society who assisted them with the convention 55 in the 1970s , del martin and phyllis lyon reflected that by contemporary standards , the early ideals of the dob for integration and adjustment of the lesbian into society were outmoded , but they remembered that in the 1950s and early 1960s many gay men and lesbians considered those ideals unreachable and this approach radical in 1961 the largest raid on a gay bar in san francisco resulted in the arrests of 100 people , and the police forced women arrested in another raid in chicago to disrobe to prove they were not wearing men 's underwear , bringing a call in the ladder to be more active a windfall came to the group when an anonymous donor who refused for her name to be recorded , known only to the dob as '' pennsylvania , '' began donating large sums of money to the dob : 100,000 over five years because the ladder was the primary method of communication from the leadership of the dob to its individual chapters , the editor position was extremely influential in the group in 1964 , martin and lyon began to control less of the organization , saying , '' we felt that if the organization had any validity at all it could n't be based on two people , it had to be able to stand and grow on its own most notably , on the eve of january 1 , 1965 , several homophile organizations in san francisco , california , including the dob , the crh , the society for individual rights , and the mattachine society , held a fund-raising ball for their mutual benefit at california hall on polk street san francisco police had agreed not to interfere ; however , on the evening of the ball , the police showed up in force and surrounded the california hall and focused numerous klieg lights on the entrance to the hall evander smith , a lawyer for the groups organizing the ball including the dob , and herb donaldson tried to stop the police from conducting the fourth '' inspection '' of the evening ; both were arrested along with two heterosexual lawyers , elliott leighton and nancy may , who were supporting the rights of the participants to gather at the ball but twenty-five of the most prominent lawyers in san francisco joined the defense team for the four lawyers , and the judge directed the jury to find the four not guilty before the defense had even had a chance to begin their argumentation when the case came to court this event has been called '' san francisco 's stonewall '' by some historians ; the participation of such prominent litigators in the defense of smith , donaldson and the other two lawyers marked a turning point in gay rights on the west coast of the united states the homophile movement was influenced by the successful activism of the civil rights movement ( possibly partially because in 1964 cleo bonner , an african-american , was elected the dob 's national president ) and higher-profile members of the dob , such as barbara gittings , del martin and phyllis lyon , began to picket the white house , the state department , and other federal buildings in 1965 and 1966 with members of the mattachine society gittings , as editor of the ladder , encouraged others to do the same , and their activism became controversial in the leadership of the dob gittings also ran a regular column in the ladder that she called '' living propaganda '' encouraging women to come out to their friends and family members del martin has written that the daughters of bilitis was a feminist organization from the beginning , focusing on the problems of women as well as problems of the female homosexual ; however , in the mid-1960s feminism became a much higher priority to many of the women in the organization in 1966 , del martin and phyllis lyon joined the national organization for women , and urged readers of the ladder to do the same , even reporting they got a family discount 59 the historian martin meeker points to the 1966 dob convention that was a 10-day affair joining the dob with the north american conference of homophile organizations ( nacho ) as the turning point where women 's issues in the dob began to have more importance to its members than gay issues 228-229 it was the largest convention dob had yet organized , publicized in mass media all over san francisco , attended by a large panel of nationally known speakers , and many of the presentations focused on topics that were exclusively male-centered a november 1966 essay by dob president shirley willer pointed out the differences in problems faced by gay men and lesbians : gay men dealt more with police harassment , entrapment , solicitation , sex in public places , and until recently few women were being arrested for cross-dressing feeling as if their issues were not being addressed by homophile organizations , many members of the dob began to say that lesbians had more in common with heterosexual women than men ( though not all older members in the dob were anti-radical ; for example , as president of the new york chapter of the dob , ruth simpson organized gay rights demonstrations as well as educational programs for dob members during the period of 1969–71 in 1970 , convinced that the dob was falling apart and the ladder must be saved , barbara grier worked with dob president rita laporte to take the subscriber list from the dob headquarters in san francisco to reno and expand the magazine further grier also effectively ended the ladder , despite her plans for the magazine to run on advertising ( something the ladder had not previously had ) and subscriptions , when the 3,000 checks from '' pennsylvania '' written to the dob stopped coming faderman , chapters 8-10 however , the impact of the 14-year run of the dob on the lives of women was described by historian martin meeker thusly : '' the dob succeeded in linking hundreds of lesbians across the country with one another and gathering them into a distinctly modern communication network that was mediated through print and , consequently , imagination , rather than sight , sound , smell , and touch the complete surviving organizational records of the national office and the san francisco chapter of the daughters of bilitis are available to researchers as part of the phyllis lyon and del martin papers at the glbt historical society , a nonprofit archives and research center in san francisco boston 's the history project archive houses the boston daughters of bilitis collection , which contains the boston chapter 's organization records , as well as the publication records of boston dob 's magazine maiden voyage , later renamed focus
