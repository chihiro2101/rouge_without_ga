this 2009 proposed classification system also outlined the taxonomy for the other clades of conoidea ( that do not resorb their inner walls ) , also based upon morphological , anatomical , and molecular studies , and removes the turridae ( which are a distinct large and diverse group ) from the cone snails , and creates a number of new families the following list of genera that used to be included in conidae is retained as a historical reference : abyssobela kantor & sysoev , 1986 acamptodaphne shuto , 1971 agathotoma cossman , 1899 aliceia dautzenberg & fischer , 1897 antimitra iredale , 1917 asperdaphne hedley , 1922 asprella ( considered a synonym of conus by some authors ) austrodaphnella laseron , 1954 bactrocythara woodring , 1928 bathybela kobelt , 1905 bathytoma harris & burrows 1891 bela gray , 1847 belaturricula powell , 1951 benthomangelia thiele , 1925 borsonella dall , 1908 brachycythara woodring , 1928 buccinaria kittl , 1887 cenodagreutes e.h molecular phylogeny , particularly with the advent of nuclear dna testing in addition to the mdna testing ( testing in the conidae initially began by christopher meyer and alan kohn interview of professor alan kohn , professor emeritus , zoology ) , is continuing on the conidae proposed a new classification in which several subfamilies were raised to the rank of family : clathurellinae was split into three families : borsoniidae ( also including species from turridae ) , mitromorphidae and clathurellidae ( all previously lumped under the turridae ) , from 1993 to 2011 , the family conidae was defined as including not only the cone snails , but also a large number of other genera which are commonly known as turridae however , as a result of molecular phylogeny studies in 2011 , many of those genera were moved back to the turridae , or were placed in new '' turrid '' families within the superfamily conoidea in further taxonomic changes that took place in 2009 and 2011 , based upon molecular phylogeny ( see below ) , the subfamilies that were previously in the family turridae were elevated to the status of families in their own right 133 in their phylogeny , tucker and tenorio noted the close relationship of the cone species within the various clades , corresponding to their proposed families and genera ; this also corresponded to the results of prior molecular studies by puillandre et al the results suggested that the authors should place all living cone snails in a single family , conidae , containing the following genera : californiconus j normally , cone snails ( and many species in the superfamily conoidea ) use their venom to immobilize prey before engulfing it this left the family conidae once again containing only those species that were traditionally placed in that family : the cone snail species tenorio ( august 2011 ) , a new , distinct endemic africonus species ( gastropoda , conidae ) from sao vicente island , cape verde archipelago , west africa , gloria maris 50 ( 5 ) : 124-135 w-conopeptide , from the species conus magus is the basis of the analgesic drug prialt , an approved treatment for pain said to be 1000 times as powerful as morphine and used as a last resort in specific application , 1878 veprecula melvill , 1917 vepridaphne shuto , 1983 virgiconus ( considered a synonym of conus by some authors ) virroconus ( considered a synonym of conus by some authors ) xanthodaphne powell , 1942 zenepos finlay , 1928 zierliana gray , 1847 bouchett ( 2008 ) , starting to unravel the toxoglossan knot : molecular phylogeny of the '' turrid '' ( neogastropoda : conoidea ) , molecular phylogenetics and evolution 47:1122-1134 tucker and tenorio â€™ s proposed classification system for the cone shells and their allies ( and the other clades of conoidea ) is shown in tucker & tenorio cone snail taxonomy 2009 ( 1993 ) , and the taxonomy of the gastropoda ( bouchet & rocroi , 2005 ) , this family consisted of seven subfamilies the subfamilies included many subfamilies that had previously been classified in the family turridae , and the conus species were moved to the subfamily coninae some species reportedly can kill a human in under five minutes , thus the name '' cigarette snail '' as supposedly one only has time to smoke a cigarette before dying ( 2005 ) , inferring the mode of speciation in the indo-west pacific conus ( gastropoda : conidae ) , journal of biogeography 32:1429-1439 in the journal of molluscan studies , in 2014 , puillandre , duda , meyer , olivera & bouchet presented a new classification for the old genus conus conorbiinae was raised to the rank of family conorbidae , consisting of three genera : artemidiconus da motta , 1991 , benthofascis iredale , 1936 , and conorbis swainson , 1840
