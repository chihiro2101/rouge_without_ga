) solutions to johann bernoulli 's problem of 1696 : isaac newton ( january 1697 ) '' de ratione temporis quo grave labitur per rectam data duo puncta conjungentem , ad tempus brevissimum quo , vi gravitatis , transit ab horum uno ad alterum per arcum cycloidis '' ( on a proof that the time in which a weight slides by a line joining two given points is the shortest in terms of time when it passes , via gravitational force , from one of these points to the other through a cycloidal arc ) , philosophical transactions of the royal society of london , 19 : 424-425 '' ( given in a vertical plane two points a and b ( see figure 5 ) , assign to the moving body m , the path amb , by means of which — descending by its own weight and beginning to be moved by gravity from point a — it would arrive at the other point b in the shortest time '' ( his communication together with those of two others in a report to him first from johann bernoulli , and then from the marquis de l'hôpital , of reported solutions of the problem of the curve of quickest descent , which was publicly proposed by johann bernoulli , geometer — one with a solution of his other problem proposed afterwards by the same person in a letter to henri basnage , held at the university of basel public library , dated 30 march 1697 , johann bernoulli stated that he had found two methods ( always referred to as '' direct '' and '' indirect '' ) to show that the brachistochrone was the '' common cycloid '' , also called the '' roulette '' , curve , that is , in which a weight descends from a given point to a given point in the shortest time , and on constructing the tautochrone or the wave of light rays from the preceding it is possible to infer that the quickest path of all lationem omnium velocissimam , from one point to another , is not the shortest path , namely , a straight line , but the arc of a circle johann published the solution in the journal in may of the following year , and noted that the solution is the same curve as huygens 's tautochrone curve '' ( the curvature of light rays in non-uniform media , and a solution of the problem which was proposed by me in the acta eruditorum of 1696 , p earlier , in 1638 , galileo had tried to solve a similar problem for the path of the fastest descent from a point to a wall in his two new sciences this paper was largely ignored until 1904 when the depth of the method was first appreciated by constantin carathéodory , who stated that it shows that the cycloid is the only possible curve of quickest descent '' , and newton had already solved newton 's minimal resistance problem , which is considered the first of the kind in calculus of variations all the other proofs , including newton 's ( which was not revealed at the time ) are based on finding the gradient at each point he said : bernoulli wrote the problem statement as : johann and his brother jakob bernoulli derived the same solution , but johann 's derivation was incorrect , and he tried to pass off jakob 's solution as his own according to him , the other solutions simply implied that the time of descent is stationary for the cycloid , but not necessarily the minimum possible however , his proof is marred by his use of a single constant instead of the three constants , v m , 2g and d , below in his paper , jakob bernoulli gave a proof of the condition for least time similar to that below before showing that its solution is a cycloid
