in cantilever bridges , the cantilevers are usually built as pairs , with each cantilever used to support one end of a central section this is very helpful when temporary supports , or falsework , can not be used to support the structure while it is being built ( e.g therefore , some truss arch bridges ( see navajo bridge ) are built from each side as cantilevers until the spans reach each other and are then jacked apart to stress them in compression before finally joining 1 july 2005 less obvious examples of cantilevers are free-standing ( vertical ) radio towers without guy-wires , and chimneys , which resist being blown over by the wind through cantilever action at their base file : canton viaduct , southern view , west side.jpg a cantilevered railroad deck and fence on the canton viaduct file : cantilever-barn-moa-tn1.jpg a cantilever barn in rural tennessee file:18-22-186-cades.jpg cantilever barn at cades cove file : doublejettiedbuilding.jpg a double jettied building in england file : cantilever jenga.jpg cantilever occurring in the game '' jenga '' file : busan_film_center.jpg busan cinema center in busan , south korea , with the world 's longest cantilever roof file : riverplace tower in jacksonville.jpg cantilever facade of riverplace tower in jacksonville , florida , by welton becket and kbj architects file : cantilever crown.png this radiograph of a '' bridge '' dental restoration features a cantilevered crown to the left file : ronan point collapse closeup.jpg ronan point : structural failure of part of floors cantilevered from a central shaft the end fixed rigidly to the central fuselage is known as the root and the far end as the tip however , as the speed of the aircraft increases , the drag of the bracing increases sharply , while the wing structure must be strengthened , typically by increasing the strength of the spars and the thickness of the skinning at speeds of around the drag of the bracing becomes excessive and the wing strong enough to be made a cantilever without excess weight penalty other changes such as enclosed cockpits , retractable undercarriage , landing flaps and stressed-skin construction furthered the design revolution , with the pivotal moment widely acknowledged to be the macrobertson air race of 1934 , which was won by a de havilland dh.88 comet calleja : tackling reproducibility in microcantilever biosensors : a statistical approach for sensitive and specific end-point detection of immunoreactions , analyst 138 , 863â€“872 ( 2013 ) however , it has been shown that microcantilever thicknesses can be precisely measured and that this variation can be quantified a chemical sensor can be obtained by coating a recognition receptor layer over the upper side of a microcantilever beam in the static mode of operation , the sensor response is represented by the beam bending with respect to a reference microcantilever recently , microcantilevers have been fabricated that are porous , allowing for a much larger surface area for analyte to bind to , increasing sensitivity by raising the ratio of the analyte mass to the device mass surface stress on microcantilever , due to receptor-target binding , which produces cantilever deflection can be analyzed using optical methods like laser interferometry , also showed that by changing the attachment protocol of the receptor on the microcantilever surface , the sensitivity can be further improved when the surface stress generated on the microcantilever is taken as the sensor signal a cantilever rack is a type of warehouse storage system consisting of the vertical column , the base , the arms , and the horizontal and/or cross-bracing
