at this time , the mersey was considerably wider with sand dunes and marshes to the north leading up to ainsdale beach and sandstone cliffs and shorelines to the south near otterspool in 1317 , a royal licence was issued , granting permission to the priory to build lodging houses for men crossing the river at woodside in 1330 , his son edward iii granted a charter to the priory and its successors for ever : '' the right of ferry there… for men , horses and goods , with leave to charge reasonable tolls '' in 1414 , william de stanley , the servant of john talbot , later earl of shrewsbury , was on the ferry between birkenhead and liverpool when about 200 men assaulted him , and stole his bay horse valued at £5 ( current value - over £2,800 ) , a bow and 14 arrows valued at 3s 4d ( current value - over £95 ) and a barge valued at £10 ( current value - over £5,700 ) the monks of birkenhead priory operated a ferry service until the dissolution of the monasteries and the priory 's destruction by henry viii 's troops in 1536 by the 18th century , the commercial expansion of liverpool and the increase in stage coach traffic from chester spurred the growth of the transportation of passengers and goods across the river by 1753 the cheshire side of the mersey had at least five ferry houses at ince , eastham , the rock , woodside and seacombe the first steamship to operate on the mersey was the elizabeth , a wooden paddle steamer , which was introduced in 1815 to operate between liverpool and runcorn these were long piers that were mounted on wheels and , by using a steam engine , could be wheeled in and out depending on the level of the tide at woodside , a small slipway was built on the beach to allow the boats to berth , and in 1822 the paddle steamer royal mail began commercial operation between liverpool and woodside the woodside , north birkenhead and liverpool steam ferry company was formed in 1835 , and the slipway at woodside was widened and constructed as a stone pier until the establishment of the mersey railway in 1886 , the ferries were the only means of crossing the river , and so all of the routes were heavily used the woodside ferry was taken over by the birkenhead commissioners in 1858 and , in 1861 , the wallasey local board took over the ferry services at seacombe , egremont and new brighton on 26 november 1878 , the ferry gem , a paddle steamer operated from seacombe by the wallasey local board , collided with the bowfell , a wooden sailing ship at anchor on the river mersey ; five people died as a result the pier and landing stage at rock ferry was built in 1899 , and birkenhead corporation also operated the ferry service at new ferry during the first world war the steamers iris and daffodil were taken out of service from wallasey to be used as troop ships in the zeebrugge raid in belgium the ferries had a shallow draft , allowing them to skim over the mines floating beneath the surface , and were robust enough to approach the heavily defended mole curling into the north sea they both saw action , which was described on 24 april 1918 by roger keyes , 1st baron keyes of the royal navy in a message to the ferries ' manager : '' i am sure it will interest you to know that your two stout vessels carried bluejackets and marines to zeebrugge , and remained alongside the mole for an hour , greatly contributing to the success of the operation the early incarnations of today 's modern vessels can be seen in some of the early propeller driven ships , mainly the 1906 pair , royal iris and royal daffodil on early paddlers , the wheelhouse and side cabs were open largely due to the transition from sail to steam , and most ships at the time had open navigation bridges with the ferries being no different the upton vessel was taken by the army and used as a ferry and supply vessel for the anti-aircraft forts in liverpool bay in 1950 , the ferries carried almost 30 million passengers a year , including 11 million on the woodside ferries and 15 million on seacombe ferries , but by 1970 the total number fell to 7 million as a result of the transport act 1968 , the transport functions of both wallasey and birkenhead corporations came under the control of the merseytravel ( mpte ) on 1 december 1969 by this time , new brighton had declined as a tourist destination and coupled with silting problems near the landing stage , the ferry service was withdrawn in 1971 , with the stage and pier subsequently demolished when the combined ferry fleet was rationalised , seacombe ferry landing stage required the construction of an additional gangway to cater for the birkenhead vessels compounded with the opening of the kingsway tunnel on 28 june 1971 and a further decline in passenger numbers ( only 4,000-5,000 a day ) , the future of the service was uncertain the ferries also began to operate summer manchester ship canal cruises , a service which had been popular for many year since the canal opened , but declined somewhat in the 1960s and 1970s this was another blow to the mersey ferries and the ferry service had to be re-focussed away from commuter traffic , which had declined , to tourist needs the '' royal '' prefix was granted to the ferries iris and daffodil for their service during the first world war where they were instrumental at the mole in zeebrugge the royal daffodil ii was hit by a bomb and sunk at her berth in the second world war , but later raised and returned to service , with little of her pre-war splendour with the merger of the wallasey and birkenhead fleets in 1969 , the ferries lost their wallasey colours to be replaced with the primrose yellow and powder blue of the mpte , and latterly emerald green and black the current mersey ferries fleet comprises two vessels , based on a similar design by naval architects graham and woolnough of liverpool until 2012 a third ferry , royal daffodil , was also in service they were loosely based on designs of the leasowe and egremont of the wallasey fleet , although they both weighed considerably more at 464 tonnes , compared with 311 tonnes for the earlier vessels the mountwood was used in the film '' ferry cross the mersey '' , a musical and subsequent gerry & the pacemakers song , crossing to liverpool from birkenhead the addition of a totally enclosed bridge meant that there only needed to be one binnacle upon it , whereas on the two sisters there were three , one inside the main wheelhouse and two in the docking/navigation boxes the overchurch also had much of its instrumentation fitted into specially built units , meaning the ferry had a spacious bridge , rather than the more compact and cluttered bridges of the mountwood and woodchurch she was not sold and after main engine repairs and a full repaint woodchurch returned to service in 1983 , freeing up overchurch to become the primary ferry to be used on a new otterspool service , set up for the 1984 international garden festival early birkenhead steamers carried red and black , however this appears to have changed to orange in the 1920s or 1930s and this remained up until the merger of the two fleets under the mpte in 1969 the overchurch was given her major refit in 1998 at lengthline ship repairers in manchester , which resulted in a major rebuilding of all decks and fitting of new engines and navigation equipment mountwood and woodchurch were also refitted and renamed royal iris of the mersey and snowdrop , respectively in 2002 and 2004 the current two ferries have been in service for nearly 60 years and 2019 sees the 60th anniversary of the launching of royal iris of the mersey and the snowdrop this remarkable service life is testament to the dedication and care taken by the ferries ' staff over the years to keep the boats in the conditions they can be found today both royal iris of the mersey and snowdrop have an e-flat tone , and royal daffodil 's is in f sharp a combination of the tall ships and the golf open at nearby royal birkdale ensured over 1 million visitors to the city over the weekend , with many of these taking a trip on the famous ferries sunday 20 july saw an unusual sight of all three ferries out on the river at night , with the snowdrop being berthed at woodside and the royal iris and royal daffodil at seacombe all three ferries were packed to capacity over the weekend , with the royal daffodil operating a special cruise to witness the parade of sail and departure of the ships on monday 21 july in august 2012 , it was announced that merseytravel were initiating a review into cost saving on mersey ferries operations after the service is running at a £1 million annual loss another threat to the ferries ' future is the cost of replacing the current ferries , the oldest ever to ply the river , when required in december 2015 merseytravel announced a 20-year plan for the ferries which included the possible closure of one of the two wirral landing stages ( possibly woodside ) , a later start to commuter services which only operate from seacombe to liverpool , and one or two new vessels with better ability to hold social functions or musical events , a facility not available since the disposal of the 1951 royal iris '' mersey ferry terminal could close , 20-year plan reveals '' , bbc news , 16 december 2015 the mersey ferries long term strategy , whilst currently subject to approval , anticipates that a naval architect will be appointed with the intention of having a new vessel ready for service in 2020–21 by using a share of a £172m 'transforming cities fund ' , it is hoped that at least one of the two ferries will be in service by 2022 in 1989 , a charity version of the song was recorded by liverpool artists the christians , holly johnson , paul mccartney , gerry marsden , and stock aitken waterman , and was released in aid of those affected by the hillsborough disaster the ferries were referred to repeatedly in helen forrester 's 1974 book twopence to cross the mersey , because the fare for a journey to the wirral ( two pence ) was too expensive for a destitute
