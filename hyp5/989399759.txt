the algorithm iterates over the collection of link-state advertisements ; for each one , it makes links on the map of the network , from the node which sent that message , to all the nodes which that message indicates are neighbors of the sending node to create the routing table , it is only necessary to walk the tree , remembering the identity of the node at the head of each branch , and filling in the routing table entry for each node one comes across with that identity finally , with the complete set of link-state advertisements ( one from each node in the network ) in hand , each node produces the graph for the map of the network as a necessary precursor , each node in the network remembers , for every one of its neighbors , the sequence number of the last link-state message which it received from that node the shortest path from that node to any other node is indicated by the list of nodes one traverses to get from the root of the tree , to the desired node in the tree , one in which the network was divided into areas ) so that each switching node does not need a map of the entire network , only the area ( s ) in which it is included what is believed to be the first adaptive routing network of computers , using link-state routing as its heart , was designed and implemented during 1976-77 by a team from plessey radar led by bernard j harris ; the project was for '' wavell '' - a system of computer command and control for the british army for any given destination node , the best path for that destination is the node which is the first step from the root node , down the branch in the shortest-path tree which leads toward the desired destination node , if one node reports that it is connected to another , but the other node does not report that it is connected to the first , there is a problem , and the link is not included on the map the link-state message giving information about the neighbors is recomputed , and then flooded throughout the network , whenever there is a change in the connectivity between the node and its neighbors ; e.g each node independently runs an algorithm over the map to determine the shortest path from itself to every other node in the network ; generally some variant of dijkstra 's algorithm is used the variant of a greedy algorithm then repetitively does the following : all neighbour nodes which are directly connected to the node are just added to the tree ( excepting any nodes which are already in either the tree or the candidate list ) these are situations in which , in the simplest form , two neighboring nodes each think the other is the best path to a given destination first , each node needs to determine what other ports it is connected to , over fully working links ; it does this using a reachability protocol which it runs periodically and separately with each of its directly connected neighbours next , each node periodically ( and in case of connectivity changes ) sends a short message , the link-state advertisement , which : identifies the node which is producing it , has a higher sequence number ) , it is saved , the sequence number is updated , and a copy is sent in turn to each of that node 's neighbors for instance , a node that has only one connection to the network graph does not need to send lsa messages , as the information on its existence could be already included in the lsa message of its only neighbor ) this procedure ends with the tree containing all the nodes in the network , with the node on which the algorithm is running as the root of the tree
