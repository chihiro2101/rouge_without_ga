research demonstrates that many factors may influence youth to engage in high-risk behaviors , including '' a lack of stable role models , heightened family stresses , lowered levels of family investment , weakened emotional bonds between parents and their children , lowered levels of social capital and social control , and a lack of hope in ones future '' these worries have prompted the creation of parenting websites such as theyouthculturereport.com and the center for parent youth understanding ( cpyu.org ) , whose goal is to preserve the values of older generations in young people these perceptions have led many adults to believe that adolescents hold different values than older generations and to perceive youth culture as an attack on the morals of current society additionally , peer influence varies greatly between contexts and by sex , age , and social status , making a single '' youth culture '' difficult , if not impossible , to define others argue that there are definite elements of youth society that constitute culture , and that these elements differ from those of their parents ' culture tested the following hypothesis : '' if youth culture serves to help adolescents deal with problems of vulnerability and finiteness , then reminders of mortality should lead to increased allegiance to cultural practice and belief of the youth the goal of this stage of life is to answer the question , '' who am i ? '' this can be difficult in many societies in which adolescents are simultaneously expected to behave like children and take on adult roles these include organizations such as the southern student organizing committee , students for a democratic society and the student nonviolent coordinating committee , whose role in sit-ins , protests , and other activities of the civil rights movement were crucial to its success some researchers argue that youth 's values and morals are not distinct from those of their parents , which means that youth culture is not a separate culture '' the mod style and embrace of modern technology spread from the uk overseas to america , as well as other countries , proving it to be an extremely influential youth culture movement schwartz and merten used the language of adolescents to argue for the presence of youth culture as distinct from the rest of society therefore , many societies use age grouping , such as in schools , to educate their children on societies ' norms and prepare them for adulthood '' their results supported their hypothesis and the results of previous studies , suggesting that youth culture is , in fact , a culture the way young people dress , the music they listen to , and their language are often more apparent than the values they hold fasick relates youth culture as a method of identity development to the simultaneous elongation of childhood and the need for independence that occurs in adolescence if adolescents ' values are similar to their parents ' , this raises the question of why adults insist that adolescents inhabit a separate world with different values one study challenged the theory that adolescent cohorts have distanced themselves from their parents by finding that between 1976 and 1982 , a time when rates of adolescent problems increased , adolescents became less peer-oriented this not only created a look that was dramatically different from the corseted , structured dresses of previous generations , but it also created a new freedom that allowed the wearer to move in ways one was unable to before perhaps the increased prevalence of age segregation contributed to the problems of modern youth , and these problems represent a difference in values for example , parsons ( 1951 ) posited that adolescence is a time when young people are transitioning from reliance on parents to autonomy additionally , the movement utilised social media ( which can be considered an aspect of youth culture ) to schedule , coordinate , and publicize events some scholars have claimed that the activism of youth during the vietnam war was symbolic of a youth culture whose values were against those of mainstream american culture in reality , sports , language , music , clothing and dating tend to be superficial ways of expressing autonomy—they can be adopted without compromising one 's beliefs or values organizations such as the young americans for freedom , the student libertarian movement , and the student peace union were based on youth status and contributed to participation in anti-war activities the mods were young men and women who came from all classes , and they believed that their fashion choices '' gave them entrée everywhere , '' and their fashion choices empowered them the need for universalistic norms has made it impractical for young people 's socialization to come primarily from immediate family members , which would lead to significant variation in the norms that are communicated ( 2000 ) 'roots of the anti-vietnam war movement , ' in hixson , walter ( ed ) the vietnam antiwar movement the possibilities of addiction , pregnancy , incarceration , and other negative outcomes are some potentially negative effects of participation in youth culture because children spend so much time together and learn the same things as the rest of their age group , they develop their own culture on the other hand , young people need to achieve some sort of independence in order to participate in the market economy of modern society according to this theory , an especially large population of young people , especially males , is associated with social unrest , war , and terrorism
