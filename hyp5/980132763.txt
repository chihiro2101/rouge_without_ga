a soft lead bullet , or a jacketed hollow-point bullet or soft-point bullet will flatten out on impact ( if the velocity at impact is sufficient to make it deform ) , spreading the impact over a larger area of the target , allowing more total force to be applied without damaging the steel target the matchking bullet ( which is still in wide use and holds many records ) is a hollow point design with a tiny aperture in the jacket at the point of the bullet and a hollow air space under the point of the bullet , where previous conventional bullets had a lead core that went all the way up to the point the concern is not depressurization ( a bullet hole will not depressurise an airliner ) , but over penetration and damage to vital electrical or hydraulic lines , or injury to an innocent bystander by a bullet that travels through a target 's body completely instead of stopping in the body while the concepts of terminal ballistics can be applied to any projectile striking any target , much of the topic concerns the effects of small arms fire striking live targets and their ability to either incapacitate or kill them the sabot is a light material that transfers the pressure of the charge to the penetrator , then is discarded when the round leaves the barrel many modern tank guns are smoothbore , not rifled , because practical rifling twists can only stabilize projectiles , such as an apcbc ( apcbc ) , with a length-to-diameter ratio of up to about 5:1 and also because the rifling adds friction , reducing the velocity and thus total force it is possible to achieve the jacket completely covers the front of the bullet , although often the rear is left with exposed lead ( this is a manufacturing consideration : the jacket is formed first , and the lead is swaged in from the rear ) there are three basic classes of bullets : those designed for maximum accuracy at varying ranges those designed to maximize damage to a target by penetrating as deeply as possible those designed to avoid over-penetration of a target , by deforming to control the depth to which the bullet penetrates , which as a by-product , deals more damage inside the wound the third class may limit penetration by expanding or fragmenting especially where the military requirement of a nonexpanding round is concerned , there is fierce debate over whether it is better to have fewer , larger bullets for enhanced terminal effects , or more , smaller bullets for increased number of potential target hits the length of the penetrator is limited by the ability of the penetrator to withstand launch forces whilst in the bore and shear forces along its length at impact more rarely , others are used to release chemical or biological agents , either on impact or when over the target area ; designing an appropriate fuse is a difficult task which lies outside the realm of terminal ballistics when used in the anti-tank role , a projectile that uses a shaped-charge warhead is known by the acronym heat ( high-explosive anti-tank ) the semiwadcutter consists of a conical section that comes to a smaller flat , and a thin sharp shoulder at the base of the cone the current nato 5.56mm ss109 ( m855 ) bullet uses a steel-tipped lead core to improve penetration , the steel tip providing resistance to deformation for armor piercing , and the heavier lead core ( 25 % heavier than the previous bullet , the m193 ) providing increased sectional density for better penetration in soft targets the two main advantages of this ammunition are that it is very humane , as a hit almost anywhere on most small vermin will ensure an instant kill , and that the relatively low mass bullet fragments pose a very low risk of ricochet or of penetrating unintended secondary targets the explosive is detonated when struck by the shaped charge 's jet , the detonating explosive sandwich forces the two plates apart , lowering the jets â€™ penetration by interfering with , and disrupting it for the purposes of aerodynamic efficiency the tip of the hollowpoint will often be tipped with a pointed polymer 'nose ' which may also aid in expansion by functioning as a piston upon impact pushing the hollow point open 44 magnum , for example , with an original weight of 240 grains ( 15.55 g ) and a diameter of 0.43 & nbsp ; inch ( 11 & nbsp ; mm ) might mushroom on impact to form a rough circle with a diameter of 0.70 & nbsp ; inch ( 18 & nbsp ; mm ) and a final weight of 239 grains ( 15.48 g ) this process is informally called mushrooming , as the ideal result is a shape that resembles a mushroom & mdash ; a cylindrical base , topped with a wide surface where the tip of the bullet has peeled back to expose more area while traveling through a body this becomes irrelevant when shooting at longer ranges because it is unlikely that fragments created by the impact of any type of bullet on a steel target will travel more than 50-100yds , in these long range cases it is of more value to use bullets that fly identically to those to be used in real situations than to mitigate the possible risks of bullet fragments and ricochets so frangible bullets are typically not used bullets for maximum penetration are designed to resist deformation on impact , and usually are made of lead that is covered in a copper , brass , or mild steel jacket ( some are even solid copper or bronze alloy ) by far the most common use of frangible ammunition is for training by shooting steel targets at close ranges , while one may be at risk of being injured by fragments of standard solid lead bullets at close ranges when shooting steel , the powder that frangible bullets disintegrate into upon impact poses a very low risk to the shooter these bullets are designed to penetrate deeply through muscle and bone , while causing a wound channel of nearly the full diameter of the bullet the flat front punches out a large hole in the paper , close to , if not equal to , the full diameter of the bullet penetration of the hollowpoint would be less than half that of a similar nonexpanding bullet , and the resulting wound or permanent cavity would be much wider if a bomblet strikes an armoured vehicle , there is also a chance that the shaped charge will ( if used ) penetrate and disable the vehicle it might seem that if the whole purpose of a maximum disruption round is to expand to a larger diameter , it would make more sense to start out with the desired diameter rather than relying on the somewhat inconsistent results of expansion on impact while a bullet that penetrates through-and-through tends to cause more profuse bleeding , allowing a game animal to be bloodtrailed more easily , in some applications , preventing exit from the rear of the target is more desirable the use of a wildcat based ( ultra ) long-range cartridge demands the use of a custom or customized rifle with an appropriately cut chamber and a fast-twist bore
