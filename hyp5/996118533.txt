he argued that the ten commandments displayed in the texas capitol grounds transmitted the message : '' this state endorses the divine code of the 'judeo-christian ' god gant , which held that '' police may search a vehicle incident to a recent occupant 's arrest only if the arrestee is within reaching distance of the compartment at the time of the search or it is reasonable to believe the vehicle contains evidence of the offense of arrest in a 2009 paper , ward farnsworth argued that stevens ' '' dissents against type '' ( in stevens ' case , votes in dissent in favor of the government 's position and against the accused , such as the one in kyllo ) suggest that while stevens '' believed strongly in laying out resources for the sake of accuracy and opportunities to protest an unfair trial , he is not nearly as concerned about restraining the government at the front end of the process , when it is gathering evidence—for the costs of invaded rights then are to liberty rather than to accuracy '' soon after his vote in baze , stevens told a sixth circuit conference that one of the drugs ( pancuronium bromide ) in the three-drug cocktail used by kentucky to execute death row inmates is prohibited in kentucky for euthanizing animals he explained that his death penalty decisions were influenced , in part , by an increasing awareness through dna testing of the fallibility of death sentences , and the fact that death-qualified juries come with a set of biases stevens , at the time of his opinion in baze , was one of four justices ( brennan , marshall , and blackmun ) who had concluded that post-gregg capital punishment is unconstitutional under the eighth amendment if the statute is unclear ( and is thus thought to reflect a congressional delegation of power to the agency to interpret the statute ) , and the agency interpretation has the force of law , courts defer to an agency 's interpretation of the statute unless that interpretation is deemed to be '' arbitrary , capricious , or manifestly contrary to the statute '' ) although chevron has come to stand for the proposition of deference to agency interpretations , stevens , the author of the opinion , was less willing to defer to agencies than the rest of his colleagues on the court he continued , '' the endorsement of that position by the majority of this court can only lend credence to the most cynical appraisal of the work of judges throughout the land heller struck down provisions of the firearms control regulations act of 1975 and held that the second amendment protects an individual 's right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia for traditionally lawful purposes , such as self-defense within the home '' stevens also stated that the amendment was notable for the '' omission of any statement of purpose related to the right to use firearms for hunting or personal self-defense '' which was present in the declarations of rights of pennsylvania and vermont the stevens dissent seems to rest on four main points of disagreement : that the founders would have made the individual right aspect of the second amendment express if that was what was intended ; that the '' militia '' preamble and exact phrase '' to keep and bear arms '' demands the conclusion that the second amendment touches on state militia service only ; that many lower courts ' later '' collective-right '' reading of the miller decision constitutes , which may only be overturned at great peril ; and that the court has not considered gun-control laws ( e.g '' on march 27 , 2018 , days after the march for our lives demonstrations in the wake of the stoneman douglas high school shooting , described by many media outlets as a possible tipping point for gun control legislation , stevens wrote an essay for the new york times , stating that the demonstrators should be demanding the outright repeal of the second amendment : in 2011 , stevens published a memoir entitled five chiefs : a supreme court memoir , which detailed his legal career during the tenure of five of the supreme court 's chief justices john paul stevens , five chiefs : a supreme court memoir ( 2011 ) ;
