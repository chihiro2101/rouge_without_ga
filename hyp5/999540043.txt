he was now deprived of his lordship by bohemond 's return meanwhile , raymond of toulouse had established himself in tripoli with the aid of alexios , and was able to check the expansion of antioch to the south either way , he enthralled audiences across france with gifts of relics from the holy land and tales of heroism while fighting the infidel , gathering a large army in the process of this marriage wrote abbot suger : bohemond came to france to seek by any means he could gain the hand of the lord louis ' sister constance , a young lady of excellent breeding , elegant appearance and beautiful face the prince of antioch was experienced and rich both in gifts and promises ;
