this allows hosts in the dmz to communicate with both the internal and external network , while an intervening firewall controls the traffic between the dmz servers and the internal network clients , and another firewall would perform some level of control to protect the dmz from the external network the external network is formed from the isp to the firewall on the first network interface , the internal network is formed from the second network interface , and the dmz is formed from the third network interface hosts in the dmz are permitted to have only limited connectivity to specific hosts in the internal network , as the content of dmz is not as secure as the internal network usually such a reverse proxy mechanism is provided by using an application layer firewall that focuses on the specific shape and contents of the traffic rather than just controlling access to specific tcp and udp ports ( as a packet filter firewall would do ) , but a reverse proxy is usually not a good substitute for a well thought out dmz design as it has to rely on continuous signature updates for updated attack vectors for example , a back office application access , such as an email system , could be provided to external users ( to read emails while outside the company ) but the remote user would not have direct access to their email server ( only the reverse proxy server can physically access the internal email server ) in this case , the hosts most vulnerable to attack are those that provide services to users outside of the local area network , such as e-mail , web and domain name system ( dns ) servers similarly , communication between hosts in the dmz and to the external network is also restricted to make the dmz more secure than the internet and suitable for housing these special purpose services that is , the dmz host is able to connect to other hosts on the internal network , whereas hosts within a real dmz are prevented from connecting with the internal network by a firewall that separates them unless the firewall permits the connection e-mail messages and particularly the user database are confidential , so they are typically stored on servers that can not be accessed from the internet ( at least not in an insecure manner ) , but can be accessed from email servers that are exposed to the internet this is an extra layer of security particularly recommended when internal resources need to be accessed from the outside , but it 's worth noting this design still allows remote ( and potentially malicious ) users to talk to the internal resources with the help of the proxy instead of providing a service to internal users wanting to access an external network , it provides indirect access for an external network ( usually the internet ) to internal resources the firewall becomes a single point of failure for the network and must be able to handle all of the traffic going to the dmz as well as the internal network
