others , such as replicated objects and live distributed objects , are more non-standard , in that they abandon the usual case that an object resides in a single location at a time , and apply the concept to groups of entities ( replicas ) that might span across multiple locations , might have only weakly consistent state , and whose membership might dynamically change inheritance is the ability to subclass an object class , to create a new class that is a subclass of an existing one and inherits all the data constraints and behaviors of its parents but also adds new and/or changes one or more of them function object : an object with a single method ( in c++ , this method would be the function operator , '' operator ( ) '' ) that acts much like a function ( like a c/c++ pointer to a function ) prototype object : a specialized metaobject from which other objects can be created by copying god object : an object that knows or does too much ( it is an example of an anti-pattern ) some of these extensions , such as distributed objects and protocol objects , are domain-specific terms for special types of '' ordinary '' objects used in a certain context ( such as remote method invocation or protocol stack ) a language is considered object-oriented if it is object-based and also has the capability of polymorphism , inheritance , encapsulation , and , possibly , composition in addition to distributed objects , a number of other extensions to the basic concept of an object have been proposed to enable distributed computing : protocol objects are components of a protocol stack that enclose network communication within an object-oriented interface filter object : an object that receives a stream of data as its input and transforms it into the object 's output rather than structure programs as code and data , an object-oriented system integrates the two using the concept of an '' object '' metaobject : an object from which other objects can be created ( compare with a class , which is not necessarily an object ) polymorphism refers to the ability to overload the name of a function with multiple behaviors based on which object ( s ) are passed to it 5142 , springer-verlag , berlin , heidelberg , 463-489 , generalize the replicated object concept to groups of replicas that might internally use any distributed protocol , perhaps resulting in only a weak consistency between their local states however , some oop languages such as flavors and the common lisp object system ( clos ) enable discriminating on more than the first parameter of the function singleton object : an object that is the only instance of its class during the lifetime of the program
