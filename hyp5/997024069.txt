but even in modern times , aspects are considered either hard ( the 90° square , the 180° opposition ) or easy ( the 120° trine , the 60° sextile ) the conjunction aspect ( essentially 0° , discounting orb ) can be in either category , depending on which two planets it is that are conjunct it is important to note that different astrologers and separate astrological systems/traditional utilize differing orbs ( the degree of separation between exactitude ) when calculating and using the aspects , though almost all use a larger orb for a conjunction when compared to the other aspects conjunctions are said to be the most powerful aspect , mutually intensifying the effects of the planets involved ; they are major point in an individual 's chart in particular , conjunctions involving the sun , venus , and/or jupiter , in any of the three possible conjunction combinations , are considered highly favourable , while conjunctions involving the moon , mars , and/or saturn , again in any of the three possible conjunction combinations , are considered highly unfavourable exceptionally , the sun , venus , and jupiter were in a 3-way ( beneficial ) conjunction on november & nbsp ; 9 & ndash ; 10 , 1970 , while on march & nbsp ; 10 of that same year , the moon , mars , and saturn were in 3-way ( detrimental ) conjunction if either of two planets involved in a conjunction is also under tension from one or more hard aspects with one or more other planets , then the added presence of the conjunction aspect will further intensify the tension of that hard aspect a planet in very close conjunction to the sun ( within 17 minutes of arc , or only about 0.28° ) is said to be cazimi , an ancient astrological term meaning '' in the heart '' ( of the sun ) during the late middle ages and the renaissance , great conjunctions were a topic broached by most astronomers of the period up to the times of tycho brahe and kepler , by scholastic thinkers as roger bacon the opus majus of roger bacon , ed usually the conjunctions occur in one of the following triplicity or trigons of zodiacal constellations : aries , sagittarius , and leo taurus , capricorn , and virgo gemini , aquarius , and libra cancer , pisces , and scorpius after about 220 years the pattern shifts to the next trigon , and in about 900 years returns to the first trigon if and designate the periods of jupiter and saturn then the return takes 1/ ( 5/s-2/j ) which comes to 883.15 years , but to be a whole number of conjunction intervals it must be sometimes 913 years and sometimes 854 as the great conjunction of 1583 was the last in the watery trigon it was widely supposed to herald apocalyptic changes ; a papal bull against divinations was issued in 1586 and as nothing really significant had happened by 1603 with the advent of a new trigon , the public interest rapidly died sxt or sex ) is an angle of 60° ( 1/6 of the 360° ecliptic , or 1/2 of a trine 120° ) sqr or squ ) is an angle of 90° ( 1/4 of the 360° ecliptic , or 1/2 of an opposition 180° ) as with the trine and the sextile , in the square , it is usually the outer or superior planet that has an effect on the inner or inferior one the square 's energy is strong and usable but has a tension that needs integration between 2 different areas of life , or offers a choice point where an important decision needs to be made that involves an opportunity cost tri ) is an angle of 120° ( 1/3 of the 360° ecliptic ) , an orb of somewhere between 5° and 10° depending on the planets involved the effect will involve different areas of life being brought together that are not usually in communication since the planets are far enough apart to be in different house quadrants , like the trine , but often with a shift in perspective involving others not previously seen clearly it is a mystical aspect that indicates a hidden flow of energy between the planets involved , often involving spiritual or energetic sensitivity and an awareness of inner and more subtle , hidden levels of reality involving the planets in septile aspect the semi-square is considered to be the 8th harmonic of the chart because it is one-eighth of the 360° circle that the zodiac resides in ( i.e the semi-square is considered to be a minor hard aspect because it is thought to cause friction in the native 's life and prompt them to take some action to reduce that friction the native is thought to have a tendency to seek out those individuals who are not necessarily compatible to them , and this may lead to a sense of tension and actions to correct what to them may be frustration the parallel and antiparallel ( or contraparallel ) are two other aspects which refer to degrees of declination above or below the celestial equator
