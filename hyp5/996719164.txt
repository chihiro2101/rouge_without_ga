in 1984 , tandy corporation executive steve leininger , designer of the trs-80 model i , admitted that '' as an industry we have n't found any compelling reason to buy a computer for the home '' other than for word processing amstrad 's founder alan sugar realised that most computers in the united kingdom were used for word processing at home , and allegedly sketched an outline design for a low cost replacement for typewriters during a flight to the far east for the launch the product name '' zircon '' was jointly suggested by mej electronics and locomotive software , as both companies had been spun off from data recall , which had produced a word processing system called '' diamond '' in the 1970s in 1986 , john whitehead described the amstrad pcw as '' the bargain of the decade '' , and technology writer gordon laing said in 2007 , '' it represented fantastic value at a time when an ibm pc or a mac would cost a comparative fortune '' at its united kingdom launch in september 1985 , the basic pcw model was priced at £399 plus value added tax , which included a printer , word processor program , the cp/m operating system and associated utilities , and a basic interpreter software vendors quickly made a wide range of additional applications available , including accounting , spreadsheet and database programs , so that the system was able to support most of the requirements of a home or small business shortly afterwards the tandy 1000 was introduced in the uk with the ms-dos operating system and a similar suite of business applications and became the only other ibm-compatible personal computer system available for less than £1,000 in britain in the us the pcw was launched at a price of 799 , and its competitors were initially the magnavox videowriter and smith corona pwp , two word-processing systems whose prices also included a screen , keyboard and printer the magazine popular science thought that the pcw could not compete as a general-purpose computer , because its use of non-standard 3-inch floppy disk drives and the rather old cp/m operating system would restrict the range of software available from expanding beyond the spreadsheet , typing tutor and cheque book balancing programs already on sale however , the magazine predicted that the pcw 's large screen and easy-to-use word processing software would make it a formidable competitor for dedicated word processors in the home and business markets in the first two years over 700,000 pcws were sold , gaining amstrad 60 % of the uk home computer market , and 20 % of the european personal computer market , second only to ibm 's 33.3 % share amstrad became the dominant british personal computer company , buying all the designs , marketing rights and product stocks of sinclair research ltd 's computer division in april 1986 , while apricot later sold its manufacturing assets to mitsubishi and became a software company the daily telegraph estimated in 2000 that 100,000 were still in use in the uk , and said that the reliability of the pcw 's hardware and software and the range of independently produced add-on software for its word processing program were factors in its continued popularity however , after adjustment for inflation the retail price of a multimedia ibm-compatible pc in 1997 was about 11 % more than that of a pcw 8256 in 1985 , and many home pcs were cast-offs , sometimes costing as little as £50 , from large organisations that had upgraded their systems also available at virtuallearning.org.uk users of windows , unix or macos systems who wish to run programs that were developed for the pcw 8256 , 8512 , 9256 , 9512 and 9512+ can use an emulator called '' joyce '' both systems consisted of three units : a printer ; a keyboard ; and a monochrome crt monitor whose casing included the processor , memory , motherboard , one or two floppy disk drives , the power supply for all the units and the connectors for the printer and keyboard the floppy disk drives on these models were in the unusual 3-inch '' compact floppy '' format , which was selected as it had a simpler electrical interface than 3½-inch drives there are several techniques for transferring data from a pcw to an ibm-compatible pc , some of which also can transfer in the opposite direction , and service companies that will do the job for a fee the keyboard had 82 keys , some of which were designed for word processing , especially with the bundled locoscript software – for example to cut , copy , and paste the pcw 9512 , introduced in 1987 at a price of £499 plus vat , had a white-on-black screen instead of green-on-black , and the bundled printer was a daisy-wheel model instead of a dot-matrix printer the 9512+ had 512 & nbsp ; kb of ram , and two printer options , the amstrad daisy-wheel unit and a series of considerably more expensive canon inkjet printers : initially the bj10e , later the bj10ex and finally the bj10sx by this time other systems offered much better print quality , and the pcw was a poor choice as a general-purpose computer , because of its slow cpu and incompatibility with ms-dos systems instead of having two operating environments , locoscript for word processing and cp/m for other uses , it had its own gui operating system , known as '' rosanne '' in the magazine pcw plus dave langford expressed a series of concerns about the pcw16 : the operating system could not run the many cp/m programs available for previous pcw models ; the flash ram was too small for a large collection of programs , but programs could not be run from the floppy disk , which was designed for backing up files ; and a second-hand ibm pc with locoscript pro looked like a more sensible upgrade path for users of earlier pcws users had to reboot if they wanted to switch between locoscript and a cp/m application , unless they used a utility called '' flipper '' , which could allocate separate areas of ram to locoscript and cp/m version 2 , which was bundled with the pcw 9512 , included a spellchecker and could provide mail merge by interfacing to other products from locomotive software , such as locomail and locofile the rest of the ram was used as a ram disk ( exposed under the drive letter '' m : '' for '' memory '' ) , which was much faster than a floppy disk but lost all its data when the machine was powered off many software vendors supplied versions of their products to run with cp/m plus , making a wide range of software available for the pcw , often very cheaply : alternative word processors included superwriter and wordstar many free packages could run under cp/m but required careful setting of options to run on the pcw series , although a significant number had installer programs that made this task easier programs that were already configured for the pcw covered a broad range of requirements including word processors , databases , graphics , personal accounts , programming languages , games , utilities and a full-featured bulletin board system all pcw models , including the pcw16 , used the zilog z80 range of cpus : z80a at a clock speed of 4 & nbsp ; mhz for the 8256 , 8512 , 9512 , 9256 , 9512+ and pcw10 ; and z80a at 16 & nbsp ; mhz in the pcw16 on the other hand , the standalone locoscript word processor program was reported as using up to 154 & nbsp ; kb as normal memory and the rest as a ram disk the printer case contained only electromechanical components and high current driver electronics ; its power was supplied via a coaxial power connector socket on the monitor casing , and rather than using a traditional ieee 1284 , pin and motor signals were connected directly by a 34-wire ribbon cable to an 8041 microcontroller on the pcw 's mainboard
