the construction of fortifications in the surrounding hills had been planned as early as 1837 , but at the time of the battle only basic facilities and roadways had been completed on the north side of the long , westward-facing bay although it is known that the tower was built some time before the start of the war , the historical records do not show exactly when this occurred , and no mention of this is made in the contemporary descriptions of the siege itself the harbour of sevastopol , formed by the estuary of the chernaya , was protected against attack by sea not only by the russian war-vessels , afloat and sunken , but also by heavy granite forts on the south side and by the defensive works still , british siege batteries managed to silence the malakoff and its annexes , after having succeeded in hitting a munitions depot and , if failure had not occurred at the other points of attack , an assault might have succeeded the fighting was of the most desperate kind : the french attack on the malakoff was successful , but the other two french attacks were repelled the battle of the great redan was initially successful , but a russian counterattack drove the british out of the bastion after two hours after the french attacks on the flagstaff bastion ( left of the great redan ) were repelled the fall of the malakoff was the end of the siege of the city during the nearly one-year siege of sevastopol in the crimean war , the fortifications on the malakhov were hotly contested as they overlooked the whole city and the inner harbour after the success of the french troops under the command of marshal pelissier , later the duke of malakoff ( french : duc de malakoff ) , and general patrice de mac-mahon , the russian defenders evacuated the entire city on 8 september 1855 , bringing a climax to the war as the fortress enabled the control of the black sea port of sevastopol , the russian forces destroyed all of their equipment and withdrew , leaving russia with no more military fortifications on the black sea in terms of logistics , the british and french had a significant advantage over the russians as they were able to receive supplies from the sea , while the russians had to bring supplies over the underdeveloped and dangerous desert tracks of southern russia the short stories of leo tolstoy , who was present at the siege , give a graphic picture of the war from the russian point of view , portraying the miseries of the desert march , the still greater miseries of life in the casemates , and the almost daily ordeal of manning the lines , under shell-fire , against an assault which might or might not come in addition , the malakoff cake was named after the duke of malakoff , as was a cheese dish in parts of switzerland in france , the battle was officially commemorated in a rare way : apart from the battle of magenta ( in the italian campaign ) , it was the only one of emperor napoleon iii 's exploits to result in the awarding of a victory title ( both of ducal rank ) ; this distinction was bestowed upon marshal p√©lissier
