with the exception of a few species from the genus xanthichthys , the sexes of all species in this family are similar in appearance as a protection against predation , triggerfish can erect the first two dorsal spines : the first ( anterior ) spine is locked in place by erection of the short second spine , and can be unlocked only by depressing the second , “ trigger ” spine , hence the family name “ triggerfish ” the largest member of the family , the stone triggerfish ( pseudobalistes naufragium ) reaches , but most species have a maximum length between in crosshatch triggerfish ( xanthichthys mento ) and yellow margin triggerfish ( pseudobalistes flavimarginatus ) , eggs are spawned in the morning and they hatch after the sunset on the same day in hachijojima , izu islands , japan , one male crosshatch triggerfish ( xanthichthys mento ) has up to three females in his territory at the same time , and mates with them in pairs off florida , juveniles of some species of triggerfishes are found in floating sargassum , where they feed on the small shrimp , crab , and mollusca found there gill plates ( opercula ) , although present , are also not visible , overlaid by the tough skin , covered with rough , rhomboid scales that form a stout armor on their bodies others , however , such as the grey triggerfish ( balistes capriscus ) , are edible the eyes are small , set far back from the mouth , at the top of the head some species of triggerfish , such as the titan triggerfish , may be ciguatera and should be avoided file : redtoothed triggerfish.jpg the redtoothed triggerfish is one of the relatively few planktivores of the family the rather bizarre anatomy of the triggerfishes reflects their typical diet of slow-moving , bottom dwelling crustaceans , mollusks , sea urchins and other echinoderms , generally creatures with protective shells and spines a male and female blow water on the sandy bottom ( usually in the same spot at the same time ) and set up their egg site a single territory usually includes more than one female , and the male mates with all of the females residing in or visiting his territory ( polygyny )
