the canal begins in warwickshire near hawkesbury village at hawkesbury junction , also known as sutton stop , where it connects with the coventry canal , a little over 4 miles ( or about 7 km ) from the centre of coventry and from nuneaton when parliament considered the act of parliament for the building of the grand junction , the oxford canal successfully petitioned to make the grand junction pay '' bar tolls '' to the oxford canal to compensate for the loss of traffic south of napton within oxford 's conurbation , the end of the canal has two links to the thames : north of the city where dukes cut leads to king 's lock ; a few hundred yards ( metres ) from the heart of the city centre by oxford railway station however , the short section between braunston and napton became the link between the warwick and napton canal and the grand junction canal , making it part of the busy direct route between birmingham and london the towpath of the canal , with a extension from hawkesbury junction to coventry on the towpath of the coventry canal , forms the oxford canal walk after below isis lock the oxford canal ends abruptly at hythe bridge street near to the current hythe bridge over the castle mill stream , a backwater of the river thames that runs parallel to the oxford canal for its southernmost part for the next 15 years the oxford canal became one of the most important and profitable transport links in britain , with most commercial traffic between london and the midlands using the route the route between the farms of priors hardwick and fenny compton was never straightened , and is the most circuitous in the region : taking to cover ( geodesically , as the crow flies ) during the 1960s pleasure boating began to grow in popularity and replace the old trading boats , after a fact-finding cruise on the canal , barbara castle ( minister for transport ) rejected a proposal for closure a much more direct route between london and the midlands , the grand union canal , was completed in 1805 the northern section of the oxford canal between coventry , braunston and napton remained an important trunk route , and remained extremely busy with freight traffic until the 1960s the solution to the congestion was to duplicate or twin the existing locks at hillmorton , creating three pairs of two parallel narrow locks , which allowed twice the traffic to pass the lock at any time by the mid-1950s very few narrowboats traded south of napton and the southern section was at one point being threatened with closure , although the northern section ( napton to coventry ) remained well-used by commercial traffic until the 1960s as with most of britain 's narrow canal system , the oxford canal suffered from a rapid decline in freight traffic after the second world war the canal rises from hawkesbury junction to hilmorton top lock , there is then a pound to braunston junction , where it joins the grand union canal parts of this section were straightened by raising and waterproofing in the 1820s ; the remains of a more circuitous route ( which kept to the chosen contour ) can still be seen in places in 1833 a section of the new line of canal in barby fields near dunchurch was used as a test site for a new wrought iron boat , swallow , built by graham and houston much of the london-bound traffic switched to this faster route , as it avoided the passage of the river thames which still had many flash locks the staple traffic was coal from the warwickshire and leicestershire coalfields to london via the grand union canal the route between coventry and rugby is level , with no locks , apart from the stop lock at the junction
