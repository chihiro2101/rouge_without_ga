according to sayers ' friend and biographer barbara reynolds , sayers had begun work in 1936 on thrones , dominations , a murder mystery novel in which the wimsey marriage was to be contrasted with those of two other couples by 1985 there were plans to publish the manuscript as it stood , together with some of the other short wimsey pieces , both published and unpublished , but these failed due to the death of sayers ' son and heir anthony fleming in that year lord and lady peter wimsey , returned from a european honeymoon , are settling into their new home in london , where daily life is affected by the illness and then death of the king sayers 's notes for the work were found among her papers after her death in 1957 , and were acquired in 1976 by the wade center at wheaton college , illinois jill paton walsh followed it in 2002 with another wimsey/vane novel , a presumption of death , set during world war ii and based on some short wartime writings of sayers known as '' the wimsey papers '' in 1996 the literary trustees of the estate approached novelist jill paton walsh and asked her to look at the material with a view to completing the novel after some plot twists , a second murder and a scene involving the hidden rivers and victorian sewers that run under london , it is revealed that harwell unintentionally killed his wife in a jealous rage , in the belief she was preparing to entertain a lover , although ironically her preparations had really been for him sayers had charted the developing relationship between lord peter wimsey and harriet vane over four published novels , culminating in busman 's honeymoon , the action of which takes place immediately following the couple 's wedding the remainder of the story had to be constructed from almost no data , based on what had already been written , but paton walsh has said that sayers ' notes make it clear who the murderer would be it is extremely unlikely that sayers , had she completed the book at the time itself , would have written anything of the kind , or that her publishers would have risked scandal by unleashing such a book upon the british public ; at the time , it often happened that british papers delicately avoided altogether any mention of the mess in which their king was becoming involved '' she was also able to refer to a typescript which had been found in a safe at sayers ' former literary agents and which differed in some respects from the manuscript version wilson agreed that the joins in the material appeared '' seamless '' to the amateur reader , but found the plot in the main '' rather feeble '' ; he noted paton walsh 's attempt to parody sayers ' style , '' harriet 's unorthodox approach infuriates her sister-in-law ( who believes harriet has an obligation to abandon her career , do her duty to the family and produce an heir ) but it allows her to solve most of the practical difficulties that might have stood in the way of a successful and happy marriage
