they may have swum up rivers and streams or possibly lake baikal was linked to the ocean at some point through a large body of water , such as the west siberian glacial lake or west siberian plain , formed in a previous ice age palo , risto vainola ( 2006 ) the enigma of the landlocked baikal and caspian seals addressed through phylogeny of phocine mitochondrial sequences biological journal of the linnean society 88 , 61-72 the areas of the lake in which the baikal seals reside change depending on the season , as well as other environmental factors in general , a higher concentration of baikal seals is found in the northern parts of the lake , because the longer winter keeps the ice frozen longer , which is preferable for pupping however , in recent years , migrations to the southern half of the lake have occurred , possibly to evade hunters in winter , when the lake is frozen over , seals maintain a few breathing holes over a given area and tend to remain nearby , not interfering with the food supplies of nearby seals image : nerpa festival.jpg thumb right a baikal seal costume at the nerpa festival in irkutsk , baikal region , russia since 2008 , the baikal seal has been listed as a least concern species on the iucn red list the most recent estimates are 80,000-100,000 animals , roughly equaling the carrying capacity of the lake in the last century , the kill quota for hunting baikal seals was raised several times , most notably after the fur industry boomed in the late 1970s and when official counts began indicating more baikal seals were present than previously known the quota in 1999 , 6,000 , was lowered in 2000 to 3,500 , which was still nearly 5 % of the population if the greenpeace count is correct in 2004–2006 , about 2,000 seals were killed per year according to official russian statistics , but in the same period another 1,500–4,000 are thought to have died annually due to drowning in fishing gear , poaching , and the like the chemicals are speculated to concentrate up the food chain and weaken the baikal seal 's immune system , making them susceptible to diseases such as canine distemper and the plague , which was the cause of a serious baikal seal epidemic that resulted in the deaths of 5,000–6,500 animals in 1987–1988 in general , levels of ddt and non-ortho pcb have declined in the lake from the 1990s , levels of mono-ortho pcb has showed no change , and perfluorochemical increased at present , baikal seals show lower levels of contaminants than seals of europe and north america , but higher than those in the arctic the most serious future threat to the survival of the seal may be global warming , which has the potential to seriously affect a closed cold-water ecosystem such as that of lake baikal the only known natural predator of adult baikal seals is the brown bear , but this is not believed to occur frequently the seal pups are typically hidden in a den , but can fall prey to smaller land predators such as the red fox , the sable and the white-tailed eagle females usually give birth to one pup , but they are one of only two species of true seals with the ability to give birth to twins the remaining food sources for this seal are various other fish species , especially cottocomephorus ( about 7 % of the diet during the winter and spring ) and kessler 's sculpin ( about 0.3 % of the diet in the winter and spring ) , but it may also take some invertebrates such as epischura baikalensis , gammarids and molluscs according to a 2004 paper on the foraging tactics of baikal seals , during the summer nights these seals are known to have different foraging strategies during night time and during day time in early autumn , before the entire lake freezes over , they migrate to bays and coves and hunt kessler 's sculpin , a fish that lives in silty areas and , as a result , usually contains grit and silt in its digestive system
