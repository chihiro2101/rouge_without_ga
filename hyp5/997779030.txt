sharing an account – or the password to an account – with others is not permitted , and evidence of doing so will result in the user being required to stop the practice and change their password , or in sanctions ( up to and including the account being blocked ) , depending on circumstances if you see a username that is problematic but was not obviously created in bad faith , politely draw the user 's attention to this policy , and try to encourage them to create a new account with a different username because wikipedia 's policy is that usernames should not be shared between more than one individual , the following types of usernames are not permitted because they imply shared use : usernames that are simply names of companies or groups are not permitted ( these also fall under above ) this includes : symbols and characters unrelated to the list of writing systems symbols and characters that are on the block lists at unicode symbols users with such names should be offered the opportunity for renaming their account or creating a new one ( see dealing with inappropriate usernames below ) furthermore , contributors are welcome to use usernames that are not spelled using the latin alphabet , but should bear in mind that other scripts are illegible to most contributors to the english wikipedia , and sometimes the characters may not appear correctly exceptions to this rule can be made for non-editing accounts approved to provide email access , accounts approved by the foundation : ( see list ) , and bot accounts that are maintained by more than one contributor , provided the existence of such an arrangement is made clear and has consensus these usernames are usually wp : block on sight , as a ) they do n't make good usernames in light of the above criteria , b ) they were never true usernames in the first place and would thus have been abandoned with changing software , and c ) modern software is such that an innocent contributor editing from the '' host.2.34.example.net '' server would not be affected by a block of '' user : host.2.34.example.net '' however , users who are reluctant to register a new username and are otherwise showing a positive history of contributions to wikipedia should be allowed to continue editing in a positive fashion and the matter should be dropped if you have the same name as a well-known person to whom you are unrelated , and are using your real name , you should state clearly on your userpage that you are unrelated to the well-known person do not both warn a user or discuss the matter with a user and at nearly the same time report at wp : uaa , as a warning or discussion is an invitation to the user to change names or otherwise fix the issue , while the report invites a block which would prevent this you specify your username when creating an account , and subsequently use it ( together with your secret password ) to log in to that account due to the difficulty with some web browsers in viewing non-language unicode characters and emoji , as well as concerns regarding the suitability of these characters as names , users registering after 6 november 2017 are not allowed to have the following usernames : decided after an rfc usernames containing emoji usernames that are considered to be emoticons or otherwise '' decorative '' usernames usernames that use any non-language symbols the software will not allow you to register with a username that is already in use , or one that appears too similar to one that is already in use if a name is used that implies that the user is ( or is related to ) a specific , identifiable person , the account may sometimes be blocked as a precaution against damaging impersonation , until proof of identity is provided do not edit under a name that is likely to imply that you are ( or are related to ) a specific , identifiable person , unless it is your real name if you choose to edit articles that are in any way related to your company or group , you will need to carefully follow wikipedia 's advice on editing with a conflict of interest the software prevents registration of certain names that are found to be too similar to existing ones ; if you can not register your doppelgänger username for this reason , you should visit wikipedia : request an account some usernames that appear to be in breach of this policy have been allowed to stand by consensus because they were created before a change in the policy that would now prohibit such names ( see grandfather clause ) generally , editors whose usernames are a technical or borderline violation of the username policy should be given an opportunity to discuss the username and how they may register a new username if , following an attempt to discuss a problematic username with the user , there is still doubt or disagreement as to whether the name is appropriate , you may open a wp : rfc/n , inviting other users to discuss the issue usernames including phrases such as '' wikipedia '' , '' wikimedia '' , '' wiktionary '' , '' ( wmf ) '' , or similar if they give the incorrect impression that the account may be officially affiliated with the wikimedia foundation or one of its projects once you have an account , you may create a user page , titled '' user : xxxx '' ( where '' xxxx '' is your username ) , to provide relevant information about yourself to other wikipedians the following types of username are not permitted because they may be misleading in a way that disrupts the project : usernames that impersonate other people ( see and below ) one should not choose a username that implies a relationship with an existing editor ( unless the account is actually owned or the relationship is acknowledged by the editor themselves ) certain disruptive and offensive usernames ( such as those containing contentious material about living persons , or those that are clearly abusive towards any race , religion or social groups ) should be immediately blocked by administrators and wikipedia : oversight by oversighters to protect wikipedia and the subjects involved from harm usernames that could be easily misunderstood to refer to a '' bot '' ( which is used to identify bot accounts ) or a '' script '' ( which alludes to automated editing processes ) , unless the account is of that type any user account should represent an individual and not a group ( and an individual should normally only have one user account ; see next section ) do n't send them your scans of your passport or driver 's license out of the blue ( you should be extremely careful with that ) , contact them to find out the best way to prove your identity the best way will vary , but could be by using a mail address on a domain name that belongs to you or sending out a tweet using a verified account the following types of usernames are not permitted because they are considered promotional : usernames that unambiguously represent the name of a company , group , institution or product ( e.g usernames that are very similar to existing ones can not be registered normallybut if you do want to use one , you may request its creation at wikipedia : request an account
