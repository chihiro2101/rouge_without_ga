to assist individuals sharing with those residents , a rebate ( second adult rebate ) was available , as follows : 25 % , if each of the second adults are in receipt of one of income-based jobseekers allowance , or income support , or income-related employment and support allowance , or pension credit otherwise , it is based on the combined gross weekly income of all the second adults : 15 % , if under £175 7.5 % , if between £175 and £227.99 nothing , if £228 or above however , no reduction was imposed if the claimant or their partner needed substantial care ; this qualification was met if , and only if , the claimant was : registered blind , or in receipt of the care component ( any rate ) of disability living allowance , or severe disablement allowance , or exceptionally severe disablement allowance no contribution was expected from non-dependant who would themselves qualify for council tax benefit , were not counted towards the number of residents liable for council tax ( for example , due to being a student ) , were normally resident elsewhere , or were not adults as part of the national fraud initiative , every other year , the audit commission analyses metadata deriving from council tax accounts together with the full electoral register to produce lists of people it believes should be subjected to an investigation on the basis that there is a risk that a discount is being received when an adult who does not fail to be disregarded is actually resident in the dwelling the report called for council tax to be devolved to london , for exemptions for second and empty homes to be brought to an end and for council tax to be replaced with a property tax which is proportional to the present-day value of homes if a property has been adapted to meet the needs of a disabled occupant , then , after applying in writing , and provided the adaptations are of a certain extent , the property will be rebanded to the band immediately below its normal council tax band in scotland , criticism has been levied not so much at the principle of the tax , but at its debt collection arrangements : community charge and council tax debts can be pursued up to 40 years later – few people will have conserved their payment receipts for such a long time and as such are unable to prove that they paid the consequent reduction rules vary from one local authority to another , with some councils keeping the same rules as the rebate schemes they replace , while others took the opportunity to levy a small level of tax on people with low incomes since these powers replace the former statutory rebate schemes , the government has also restricted the councils from increasing , by more than a certain amount , the net council tax bill for any individual who previously received a rebate there had been no information published on how many have been successful in obtaining a reduced banding until 22 november 2008 when the daily telegraph , in a news article about the campaign by martin lewis , stated that in the past year 97,563 properties in england and wales have been rebanded , with 69,695 of those down-graded in particular people in receipt of the guarantee credit element of pension credit must continue to receive a 100 % discount ( that is , a council tax bill of £0 ) though it is often concluded that the full council tax charge must , therefore , be based on two or more adults being resident at a property , this is not strictly true although wilson 's bill has not made any progress , the scottish parliament has passed the community charge debt ( scotland ) bill to stop councils pursuing debts from the older community charge , though there are some scrutiny stages to go through before it can become law a spouse , partner or dependent of either of the above two classes who is not a british citizen and is prohibited from working or claiming benefit by the immigration rules ( but n above may apply ) these rules are now officially known as council tax reduction schemes , though many councils market them to residents as council tax support ; the choice to market the rules as a tax cut , rather than a benefit , may be an ideological one but the remaining non-dependants were each hypothetically expected to contribute the following amounts : £2.30 if in part-time work , otherwise £2.30 if weekly income is under £178 £4.60 if weekly income is between £178 and £305.99 £5.80 if weekly income is between £306 and £381.99 £6.95 if weekly income is over £382 council tax benefit was therefore reduced by an amount equal to these hypothetically expected contributions
