some landmarks of neural development include the birth and differentiation of neurons from stem cell precursors , the migration of immature neurons from their birthplaces in the embryo to their final positions , outgrowth of axons and dendrites from neurons , guidance of the motile growth cone through the embryo towards postsynaptic partners , the generation of synapses between these axons and their postsynaptic partners , and finally the lifelong changes in synapses , which are thought to underlie learning and memory during early embryonic development of the vertebrate , the dorsal ectoderm becomes specified to give rise to the epidermis and the nervous system ; a part of the dorsal ectoderm becomes specified to neuroectoderm to form the neural plate which gives rise to the nervous system the connectome can be constructed from diffusion mri data : the vertices of the graph correspond to anatomically labelled gray matter areas , and two such vertices , say u and v , are connected by an edge if the tractography phase of the data processing finds an axonal fiber that connects the two areas , corresponding to u and v it is hypothesized in that the growing structure copies the axonal development of the human brain : the earliest developing connections ( axonal fibers ) are common at most of the subjects , and the subsequently developing connections have larger and larger variance , because their variances are accumulated in the process of axonal development developmental neuroscience uses a variety of animal models including the mouse mus musculus , the fruit fly drosophila melanogaster , the zebrafish danio rerio , the frog xenopus laevis , and the nematode caenorhabditis elegans radial glial cells , whose fibers serve as a scaffolding for migrating cells and a means of radial communication mediated by calcium dynamic activity , act as the main excitatory neuronal stem cell of the cerebral cortex or translocate to the cortical plate and differentiate either into astrocytes or neurons an example of this mode of migration is in gnrh neuron , which make a long journey from their birthplace in the nose , through the forebrain , and into the hypothalamus these intracellular signals , such as calcium signaling , lead to actin and microtubule cytoskeleton dynamics , which produce cellular forces that interact with the extracellular environment through cell adhesion proteins to cause the movement of these cells spontaneous activity occurs early during neural circuit development even when sensory input is absent and is observed in many systems such as the developing visual system , auditory system , motor system , hippocampus , cerebellum and neocortex in a later stage of development the superior part of the neural tube flexes at the level of the future midbrain—the mesencephalon , at the mesencephalic flexure or cephalic flexure the neural groove forms along the long axis of the neural plate , and the neural plate folds to give rise to the neural tube as the embryo develops , the anterior part of the neural tube expands and forms three primary brain vesicles , which become the forebrain ( prosencephalon ) , midbrain ( mesencephalon ) , and hindbrain ( rhombencephalon ) the surprising observation is that the appearance of the edges is far from random : it resembles a growing , complex structure , like a tree or a shrub ( visualized on the animation on the left ) the csf-filled central chamber is continuous from the telencephalon to the central canal of the spinal cord , and constitutes the developing ventricular system of the cns the soma is then transported to the pial surface by nucleokinesis , a process by which a microtubule '' cage '' around the nucleus elongates and contracts in association with the centrosome to guide the nucleus to its final destination embryonic cerebrospinal fluid differs from that formed in later developmental stages , and from adult csf ; it influences the behavior of neural precursors the hollow interior is called the neural canal , and the open ends of the neural tube , called the neuropores , close off in the developing zebrafish spinal cord , early spontaneous activity is required for the formation of increasingly synchronous alternating bursts between ipsilateral and contralateral regions of the spinal cord and for the integration of new cells into the circuit gradually some of the cells stop dividing and differentiate into neurons and glial cells , which are the main cellular components of the cns a part of the dorsal ectoderm becomes specified to neural ectoderm – neuroectoderm that forms the neural plate along the dorsal side of the embryo the processes of neuronal migration , differentiation and axon guidance are generally believed to be activity-independent mechanisms and rely on hard-wired genetic programs in the neurons themselves during neural induction , noggin and chordin are produced by the dorsal mesoderm ( notochord ) and diffuse into the overlying ectoderm to inhibit the activity of bmp4 in the motor system , periodic bursts of spontaneous activity are driven by excitatory gaba and glutamate during the early stages and by acetylcholine and glutamate at later stages in the developing auditory system , developing cochlea generate bursts of activity which spreads across the inner hair cells and spiral ganglion neurons which relay auditory information to the brain pharmacological disruption and mouse models lacking the β2 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor has shown that the lack of spontaneous activity leads to marked defects in retinotopy and eye-specific segregation because the neural tube gives rise to the brain and spinal cord any mutations at this stage in development can lead to fatal deformities like anencephaly or lifelong disabilities like spina bifida research findings however have implicated a role for activity-dependent plasticity in mediating some aspects of these processes such as the rate of neuronal migration , aspects of neuronal differentiation and axon pathfinding the ventral half of the neural plate is controlled by the notochord , which acts as the 'organiser ' these simple , early vesicles enlarge and further divide into the telencephalon ( future cerebral cortex and basal ganglia ) , diencephalon ( future thalamus and hypothalamus ) , mesencephalon ( future colliculi ) , metencephalon ( future pons and cerebellum ) , and myelencephalon ( future medulla ) when embryonic ectodermal cells are cultured at low density in the absence of mesodermal cells they undergo neural differentiation ( express neural genes ) , suggesting that neural differentiation is the default fate of ectodermal cells the alar plate of the prosencephalon expands to form the telencephalon which gives rise to the cerebral hemispheres , whilst its basal plate becomes the diencephalon at the onset of gastrulation presumptive mesodermal cells move through the dorsal blastopore lip and form a layer of mesoderm in between the endoderm and the ectoderm initially he thought that the extra limb was inducing proliferation of motor neurons , but he and his colleagues later showed that there was a great deal of motor neuron death during normal development , and the extra limb prevented this cell death shh binds patched , relieving patched-mediated inhibition of smoothened , leading to activation of the gli family of transcription factors ( gli1 , gli2 , and gli3 ) the hindbrain , for example , is patterned by hox genes , which are expressed in overlapping domains along the anteroposterior axis under the control of retinoic acid in the immature retina , waves of spontaneous action potentials arise from the retinal ganglion cells and sweep across the retinal surface in the first few postnatal weeks the neural plate is the source of the majority of neurons and glial cells of the cns neuroectoderm overlying the notochord develops into the neural plate in response to a diffusible signal produced by the notochord beginning in the future neck region , the neural folds of this groove close to create the neural tube activation of the receptor leads to phosphorylation and recruitment of the jak kinase , which in turn phosphorylates lifrβ
