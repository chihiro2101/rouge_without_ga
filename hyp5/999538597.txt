with a comprehensive work on dialectic ( τῆς περὶ τὸ διαλέγεσθαι πραγματείας βιϐλία ιδ΄ ) there were also separate treatises on knowledge , on knowledgibility ( περὶ ἐπιστήμης α΄ , περὶ ἐπιστημοσύνης α΄ ) , on divisions ( διαιρέσεις η΄ ) , on genera and species ( περὶ γενῶν καὶ εἰδῶν α΄ ) , on ideas ( περὶ ἰδεῶν ) , on the opposite ( περὶ τοῦ ἐναντίου ) , and others , to which probably the work on mediate thought ( τῶν περὶ τὴν διάνοιαν η΄ ) ; comp he referred knowledge ( episteme ) to that essence which is the object of pure thought , and is not included in the phenomenal world ; sensation ( aisthesis ) to that which passes into the world of phenomena ; opinion ( doxa ) to that essence which is at once the object of sensuous perception , and , mathematically , of pure reason - the essence of heaven or the stars ; so that he conceived of doxa in a higher sense , and endeavored , more definitely than plato , to exhibit mathematics as mediating between knowledge and sensuous perception we know nothing further about the mode in which xenocrates carried out his dialectic , as it is probable that what was peculiar to aristotelian logic did not remain unnoticed in it , for it can hardly be doubted that the division of the existent into the absolutely existent , and the relatively existent , simplicius , in arist 4 that he was at the head of those who , regarding the universe as unoriginated and imperishable , looked upon the chronological succession in the platonic theory as a form in which to denote the relations of conceptual succession probably we should connect with this the statement that xenocrates called unity and duality ( monas and duas ) deities , and characterised the former as the first male existence , ruling in heaven , as father and zeus , as uneven number and spirit ; the latter as female , as the mother of the gods , and as the soul of the universe which reigns over the mutable world under heaven , stobaeus , ecl 62 or , as others have it , that he named the zeus who ever remains like himself , governing in the sphere of the immutable , the highest ; the one who rules over the mutable , sublunary world , the last , or outermost 604 if , like other platonists , he designated the material principle as undefined duality , the world-soul was probably described by him as the first defined duality , the conditioning or defining principle of every separate definitude in the sphere of the material and changeable , but not extending beyond it he appears to have called it in the highest sense the individual soul , in a derivative sense a self-moving number , that is , the first number endowed with motion the divine power of the world-soul is then again represented , in the different spheres of the universe , as infusing soul into the planets , sun and moon , - in a purer form , in the shape of olympic gods as a sublunary daemonical power ( as hera , poseidon , demeter ) , it dwells in the elements , and these daemonical natures , midway between gods and men , are related to them as the isosceles triangle is to the equilateral and the scalene and the daemonical power is appeased by means of a stubbornness which it finds there congenial to it ; the good daemonical power makes happy those in whom it takes up its abode , the bad ruins them ; for eudaimonia is the indwelling of a good daemon , the opposite the indwelling of a bad one 13 we do not learn , and can only discover the one fundamental idea at the basis of them , that all grades of existence are penetrated by divine power , and that this grows less and less energetic in proportion as it descends to the perishable and individual 590 but neither the thick nor the thin , to the different combinations of which he appears to have tried to refer the various grades of material existence , were regarded by him as in themselves partaking of soul ; plutarch , de fac in orbe lunae doubtless because he referred them immediately to the divine activity , and was far from attempting to reconcile the duality of the principia , or to resolve them into an original unity nemesius , de natura hominis it is probable , that , after the example of plato , he designated the divine principium as alone indivisible , and remaining like itself ; the material , as the divisible , partaking of multiformity , and different , and that from the union of the two , or from the limitation of the unlimited by the absolute unity , he deduced number , and for that reason called the soul of the universe , like that of individual beings , a self-moving number , which , by virtue of its twofold root in the same and the different , shares equally in permanence and motion , and attains to consciousness by means of the reconciliation of this opposition vii.2.1028 recognized amongst contemporary platonists three principal views concerning the ideal numbers , and their relation to the ideas and to mathematical numbers : those who , like plato , distinguished ideal and mathematical numbers ; those who , like xenocrates , identified ideal numbers with mathematical numbers those who , like speusippus , postulated mathematical numbers only aristotle has much to say against the xenocratean interpretation of the theory , and in particular points out that , if the ideal numbers are made up of arithmetical units , they not only cease to be principles , but also become subject to arithmetical operations 3 he approximated to the pythagoreans in this , that ( as is clear from his explanation of the soul ) he regarded number as the conditioning principle of consciousness , and consequently of knowledge also ; he thought it necessary , however , to supply what was wanting in the pythagorean assumption by the more accurate definition , borrowed from plato , that it is only insofar as number reconciles the opposition between the same and the different , and has raised itself to self-motion , that it is soul 30 in them he thought he had discovered what , according to plato , plato timaeus god alone knows , and he among men who is loved by him , namely , the elements or principia of the platonic triangles de caelo convinced that the principia of the existent should be sought not in the material , not in the divisible which attains to the condition of a phenomenon , but merely in the ideal definitude of form 4 following the ideas of his academic predecessors , he viewed the good as that which should be striven after for itself , that is , which has value in itself , while the bad is the opposite of this image : xenocrates nuremberg chronicle.jpg left 180px thumb xenocrates , depicted as a medieval scholar in the nuremberg chronicle while , however , xenocrates ( and with him speusippus and the other philosophers of the older academy ) cicero , de finibus , iv 21 according , therefore , as what belongs to the intermediate region is adapted to bring about or to hinder the good , xenocrates appears to have designated it as good or evil , probably with the proviso , that by misuse what is good might become evil , and vice versa , that by virtue , what is evil might become good though its reference to the relations of human life requires the additional condition , that it is only in the enjoyment of the good things and circumstances originally designed for it by nature that it attains to completion ; to these good things , however , sensuous gratification does not belong 11 ; seneca , epistulae , 85 in this sense he on the one hand denoted ( perfect ) happiness as the possession of personal virtue , and the capabilities adapted to it , and therefore reckoned among its constituent elements , besides moral actions conditions and facilities , those movements and relations also without which external good things can not be attained , clement of alexandria , stromata , ii 10 , 26 , 31 and on the other hand did not allow that wisdom , understood as the science of first causes or intelligible essence , or as theoretical understanding , is by itself the true wisdom which should be striven after by people , clement of alexandria , stromata ; cicero , academica , ii 3 how decidedly he insisted not only on the recognition of the unconditional nature of moral excellence , but on morality of thought , is shown by his declaration , that it comes to the same thing whether one casts longing eyes , or sets one 's feet upon the property of others
