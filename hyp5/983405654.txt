mm × 61 & nbsp ; mm × 31 & nbsp ; mm ) , glass fibre reinforced makrolon bodied 35 mm film camera designed by professor fischer of vienna university : the minox el , the first one in minox 35 & nbsp ;

mm compact cameras produced from 1975 until 2004 from minox bl onward , the camera is equipped with a '' freewheeling '' mechanism , such that the film advances one frame only when a picture is taken , otherwise , closing the camera does not advance a frame from the riga to minox b , the film counter counts up to 50 , while from minox bl , c , to tlx , the film counter counts down from 36/30/15 minox pl , 1982–1983 , program-controlled version of el- or g-series minox ml , 1985–1995 minox mb , 1986–1999 minox al , 1987–1988 , simplified program-controlled version of el- or g-series minox af , 1988–1990 , autofocus minox gt-e , 1988–1993 with built in uv filter the film strips can be up to 50 frames in length for riga minox and minox ii , iii , iiis and b cameras the advance was attributed by rolf kasemeier ( small minox big pictures 1971 edition ) to new rare-earth element , high-index , low-dispersion , optical glasses becoming available ( probably from schott glass , of jena ) for riga minox to minox b , the film advances each time the camera is closed , regardless of whether a picture is taken or not a minox b , operated by remote trigger and protected in a special housing , was used to inspect the interior of the united states army 's sl-1 experimental nuclear reactor after it experienced an internal steam explosion in 1961 since the minox c ( the first camera released with the new minox lens ) every 8x11mm camera had a distinct edge code to identify the camera opening the camera causes the pressure plate to press the film into a concave or flat ( depending on the model ) surface to stiffen thin emulsions for better clarity when the camera is closed , the pressure plate moves back from the film plane , thus allowing the film strip to move freely to advance to the next frame zapp , a baltic german , was born in 1905 in riga , then part of the russian empire in the meantime , zapp and his associates protected their interest in the product by searching for alternative production facilities in germany above the viewfinder is a filter bar used to slide a yellow , green or an orange filter in front of the lens ; starting with the bl , there is only a neutral density filter as the minox lens replaced the complan , so the enlargers had to change lenses : minox ii enlargers were curved negative track and complan lenses , minox iii enlargers were straight negative track and minox lenses matching the size of the slide film for the 8×11 minox cameras , minox also produced slide projectors ending with the auto-focus hp24 model the lens was capable of focusing as close as 20 & nbsp ; cm , and , due to its small image size , provided such depth of field at full aperture that a diaphragm was deemed unnecessary
