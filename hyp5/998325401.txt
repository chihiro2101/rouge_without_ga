proton launch vehicles and briz-m upper stages are designed and built by khrunichev state research and production space center ( khrunichev ) in moscow , the majority owner of international launch services ( ils ) proton-k payloads included all of the soviet union 's salyut space stations , almost all mir modules ( with the exception of the docking module , which was launched on the united states space shuttle ) , and the zarya and zvezda modules of the international space station proton 's design was kept secret until 1986 , with the public being only shown the upper stages in film clips and photographs , and the first time the complete vehicle was shown to the outside world happened during the televised launch of mir in june 2018 , the state corporation roscosmos announced that the proton rocket would cease production as the new angara launch vehicle comes on line and becomes operational heavy variants of angara will be simpler and cheaper than proton ( and like the atlas v rocket , will not use hypergolic fuels ; instead , it will use the same rp-1 fuel as that used on the soyuz rocket ) an enhanced variant , the phase iii proton-m/briz-m launch vehicle , was flight proven on the russian federal dual mission of express am-44 and express md-1 in february 2009 and performed its first commercial launch in march 2010 with the echostar xiv satellite it was the brainchild of vladimir chelomei 's design bureau as a foil to sergei korolev 's n1 rocket , whose purpose was to send a two-man zond spacecraft around the moon ; korolev openly opposed proton and chelomei 's other designs for their use of toxic propellants on 6 august 2012 , the russian federal space agency lost a russian and an indonesian communications satellite in an attempt to launch them into orbit on a proton-m due to technical difficulties with the last stage it could place up to in low earth orbit with a 51.6-degree inclination , the orbit of the international space station ( iss ) with the recent consolidation of the russian space enterprises , khrunichev has direct oversight and control of up to 70 % of all proton manufacturing from suppliers to manufacturers this avoids the need for components that are tolerant of low temperatures , and allows the rocket to remain on the pad indefinitely ( other launchers with such capability include the u.s the initial proton tests in 1965â€“66 only used the first two stages of the booster , the complete four-stage vehicle being flown for the first time in 1967 the first stage of the proton rocket at russian space web a rushed development program led to dozens of failures between 1965 and 1972 titan ii glv , titan iii , and titan iv , the chinese long march 2 and long march 4 , the soviet/ukrainian tsyklon launchers , the soviet/russian kosmos-3 and kosmos-3m launchers and the european ariane 1 to ariane 4 launchers ) proton launched the salyut space stations , the mir core segment and expansion modules , and both the zarya and zvezda modules of the iss it was intended to launch the crewed tks spacecraft , prior to the cancellation of that programme , although a few robotic flights of spacecraft were fulfilled
