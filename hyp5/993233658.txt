some stoichiometric terminal oxidants that have been employed in these catalytic reactions include potassium chlorate , hydrogen peroxide ( milas hydroxylation ) , n-methylmorpholine n-oxide ( nmo , upjohn dihydroxylation ) , tert-butyl hydroperoxide ( tbhp ) , and potassium ferricyanide ( k 3 fe ( cn ) 6 ) potassium ferricyanide ( k 3 fe ( cn ) 6 ) is the most commonly used stoichiometric oxidant for the reaction , and is the oxidant that comes in the commercially available ad-mix preparations however , since osmium ( viii ) reagents like osmium tetroxide ( oso 4 ) are expensive and extremely toxic , it has become desirable to develop catalytic variants of this reaction barry sharpless was the first to develop a general , reliable enantioselective alkene dihydroxylation , referred to as the sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation ( sad ) in the february 1997 issue of the journal of the american chemical society sharpless published the results of a study ( a hammett analysis ) which he claimed supported a 2+2 cyclization over a 3+2 methanesulfonamide ( ch 3 so 2 nh 2 ) has been identified as a catalyst to accelerate this step of the catalytic cycle and if frequently used as an additive to allow non-terminal alkene substrates to react efficiently at 0 °c the reaction mechanism of the sharpless dihydroxylation begins with the formation of the osmium tetroxide – ligand complex ( 2 ) in the october issue of the same year , however , sharpless also published the results of another study conducted in collaboration with ken houk and singleton which provided conclusive evidence for the 3+2 mechanism given below is a brief overview of the various components of the catalytic system : catalytic oxidant : this is always oso 4 , however certain additives can coordinate to the osmium ( viii ) and modify its electronic properties oso 4 is often generated in situ from k 2 oso 2 ( oh ) 4 ( an os ( vi ) species ) due to safety concerns
