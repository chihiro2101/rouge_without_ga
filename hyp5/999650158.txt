after the death of his father sir frank in 1974 , kerry packer had assumed control of nine network , one of the many media interests owned by the family 's company consolidated press holdings ( cph ) in 1976 , packer sought the rights to televise australia 's home test matches , the contract for which was about to expire determined to get some cricket on channel nine , packer put an offer to the test and county cricket board ( tccb ) to telecast the australian cricket team in england in 1977 his interest was further stimulated by a proposal to play some televised exhibition matches , an idea presented to him by west australian businessmen john cornell and austin robertson packer took this idea , then fleshed it out into a full series between the best australian players and a team from the rest of the world his mistrust of cricket 's administrators deepened when the acb recommended the tccb accept an offer for their broadcasts rights from the abc , even though abc 's 210,000 offer was only 14 % of the offer from packer a bigger coup was achieved when packer convinced the england captain tony greig to not only sign on , but to act as an agent in signing many players around the world by the time the season climaxed with the centenary test match between australia and england at the melbourne cricket ground in march 1977 , about two dozen players had committed to packer 's enterprise , which as yet had no grounds to play on , no administration and was secret to all in the cricket world it was a measure of the players ' dissatisfaction with official cricket that they were prepared to sign up for what was still a vague concept and yet keep everything covert by the time the australian team arrived to tour england in may 1977 , thirteen of the seventeen members of the squad had committed to packer not unexpectedly , the english were critical of what they quickly dubbed the '' packer circus '' and reserved particular vitriol for the english captain tony greig , for his central role in organising the break-away greig retained his position in the team , but was stripped of the captaincy and ostracised by everyone in the cricket establishment , most of whom had been singing his praises just weeks before in light of the controversies the sydney gazette article clearly showed west indian captain clive lloyd interviewed after leaving the caribbean team to join packer , lloyd stated it was nothing personal it was clearly earning a more comfortable source of income marlar 's aggressive , indignant interrogation of packer came unstuck when packer proved to be articulate , witty and confident that his vision was the way of the future the icc decided to treat packer 's scheme with contempt when a month later they decided packer 's matches would not be given first-class status and the players involved would be banned from test match and first class cricket to clarify the legal implications ( including the proposed bans ) , packer backed a challenge to the tccb in the high court by three of his players : tony greig , mike procter and john snow are the contracts between wsc and its players void ? has wsc established that , as at 3 august , and subject to any statutory immunity conferred by the 1974 act , the trade union and labour relations act 1974 , repealed and replaced by the trade union and labour relations ( consolidation ) act 1992 it was a good cause of action in tort against the icc based on inducement of breach of contract ? has wsc established that as at 3 august and subject as aforesaid , it had a good cause of action in tort against the tccb based on the same grounds ? subject to the provisions of the 1974 act , are the new icc rules void as being in restraint of trade ? subject to aforesaid , are the proposed new tccb rules void as being in restraint of trade ? is the icc an employers ' association within the 1974 act ? is the tccb an employers ' association ? if either the icc or tccb or both be employers ' associations , does this itself bar any cause of action that would otherwise exist ? in the light of the answers , what relief ( if any ) should be given to ( a ) the individual plaintiffs and ( b ) wsc ? justice slade in his judgment said that professional cricketers need to make a living and the icc should not stand in their way just because its own interests might be damaged players could not be criticized for entering the contracts in secrecy as the main authorities would deny the players the opportunity to enjoy the advantages offered by wsc left official cricket won a series of minor victories – packer was unable to use the terms '' test match '' or call their team of australians '' australia '' , or use the official rules of cricket , which are the copyright of the marylebone cricket club most importantly , wsc was shut out of traditional cricket venues , so packer leased two australian football stadiums , vfl park in melbourne and football park in adelaide ; perth 's gloucester park ( a trotting track ) ; and the sydney showground a one-day series , the '' international cup '' featuring the australian , west indian and world teams , was played alongside six supertests in sydney , melbourne , adelaide and perth he led a team of relatively unknown youngsters ( with the exception of fast bowler jeff thomson , who did not sign up for the wsc ) to a 3–2 series victory which was not decided until the final test in adelaide the west indies cricket officials had no wish to buy into the acb-packer fight and decided to select all of their wsc players for the first two tests , until the wicb made a decision to leave out three of their wsc contracted players for the 3rd test , ostensibly to allow others a chance to play in test matches prior to the west indies ' tour to india and sri lanka later in the year , which would be at a time that world series cricket could not guarantee the availability of their west indian players the non-selection of these three players led to the resignation of clive lloyd as captain , and all of the wsc contracted west indian players to declare themselves unavailable for the rest of the series the financial and political problems of the recent australian tour led them to begin negotiations with packer for a wsc series in the caribbean during the spring of 1979 initially , pakistan took a hard line and refused to select their packer players , but when wsc signed additional pakistanis during the off season , and when an under-strength official pakistan team were easily beaten by england in the three test series in the english summer of 1978 , they took a more pragmatic approach , so when it came time in october 1978 for the first test series between pakistan and india for seventeen years , all the packer players were included the south africans , subject to an international boycott caused by the apartheid policy of their government , were keen to see their individual cricketers compete with the world 's best some were prepared to acclaim south africa as the best side of the world on the basis of the performances of some of their players in wsc after organising the tours of new zealand and the west indies , wsc began making noises about a tour to england and signing enough players for stand-alone england and pakistan teams packer demonstrated his political clout by getting new south wales premier neville wran to overturn the ban on wsc and allow matches to be played at the traditional home of the game , the sydney cricket ground ( scg ) the war swung dramatically in packer 's favour on 28 november 1978 when the first day-night match on a traditional cricket ground was played at the scg between the wsc australian and west indian teams a few days later , the official australian team was humbled in the first test against england at brisbane , a precursor to a 5–1 thrashing for a side now captained by the unprepared graham yallop wsc then headed to the caribbean for a tense , hard fought series that players from both australia and west indies declared the best they ever played in during march of that year , packer instigated a series of meetings with then chairman of the acb board , bob parish , which hammered out an agreement on the future of australian cricket not only had nine network won the exclusive rights to telecast australian cricket , it was granted a ten-year contract to promote and market the game through a new company , pbl marketing the acb capitulation infuriated the english authorities and the icc as they had provided much in the way of financial and moral support to the acb , which now appeared to have sold out to packer the feeling in many quarters was that when the australian board first found packer at their throats , the rest of the cricket world supported them to the hilt ; even to the extent of highly expensive court cases which cricket could ill afford the acb opted to not select wsc-contracted players for the tours of england ( for the 1979 world cup ) and india ( for six tests ) later in the year england and west indies toured , playing three tests each against australia , with a triangular one-day tournament ( the world series cup ) interspersed among the tests australia 's results were mixed : in the test matches , they defeated england 3–0 ( having lost 5–1 to the same opponents the previous summer ) but lost 0–2 to west indies , and they failed to make the final of the one-day tournament the popular '' c'mon aussie c'mon '' single , which reached the top of the charts , and a world series cricket autograph book however , the traditional form of the game , test cricket , is still played around the world , and in recent seasons has challenged one-day cricket for the interest of the public indeed , membership of a test cricket side is often seen as being more prestigious for players , due both to the more challenging nature of the format and to the higher turnover rate of one day players marketing was a major tool for world series cricket , and revolutionised the way cricket in australia was marketed , with the catchy '' c'mon aussie c'mon '' theme song , the simple logo , the coloured clothing worn by the players and a range of merchandise in the australian team , there was a division between the players who stayed loyal to the official xi and the packer rebels , especially between players such as dennis lillee , rod marsh , former wsc players and kim hughes who stuck with the official side many of wsc 's players fitted back into the official australian side , though a handful of players from outside wsc remained at the highest level , most notably allan border the 1977 ruling of the icc that the matches were not first-class has remained , so none of the wsc players ' records include the runs and wickets of the wsc era foreword by richie benaud golden press ( 1979 ) : '' cricket alight ! world series cricket , in australia , new zealand and the west indies '' , macarthur press
