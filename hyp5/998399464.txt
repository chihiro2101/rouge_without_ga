in the beginning , writs were the document issued by the king 's chancellor against a landowner whose vassal complained to the king about an injustice , after a first summon by the sheriff to comply had been deemed fruitless the development of writs as a means of commencing a court action was a form of '' off-the-shelf '' justice designed to enable the english law courts to rapidly process lawsuits by allocating each form of complaint into a standard category which could be dealt with by standard procedures the writ was '' served '' on ( delivered in person to ) the wrongdoer and acted as a command that he should appear at a specified time and date before the court specified in the writ , or it might command some other act on the part of the recipient however , if a plaintiff wished to avail himself of royal — and by implication superior — justice in one of the king 's courts , then he would need a writ , a command of the king , to enable him to do this while originally writs were exceptional , or at least non-routine devices , maitland suggests that by the time of king henry ii ( 1154–1189 ) , the use of writs had become a regular part of the system of royal justice in england at first , new writs were drafted to fit each new situation , although in practice the clerks of the chancery would use wording from previously issued writs , with suitable adjustments , often taken from reference books containing collections of forms of writ , much as in modern times lawyers frequently use fixed precedents or boilerplate , rather than re-inventing the wording of a new legal document moreover , a writ , if one could be found fitting the plaintiff 's case , provided the legal means to remove the dispute from the jurisdiction of the local court , often controlled by a lesser noble , and instead have it heard by the king 's judges abbot of lilleshall v harcourt ( 1256 ) 96 ss xxix 44 ultimately in 1258 , the king was forced to accept the provisions of oxford , which among other things , prohibited the creation of new forms of writ without the sanction of the curia regis a writ was a summons from the crown , to the parties to the action , with on its back the substance of the action set out , together with a 'prayer ' requesting a remedy from the court ( for example damages ) 1716 ) discussed in house of lords in 1980 , writs applied to claims that were to be heard in one of the courts which eventually formed part of the high court of justice in some westminster systems , for example canada and some other parliamentary systems , the phrase 'dropping the writ ' refers colloquially to a dissolution of parliament and the beginning of an election campaign to form a new one this phrase derives from the fact that to hold an election in such a system a writ of election must be issued on behalf of the monarch ordering the high sheriffs of each county to set in motion the procedure for elections '' however , the federal rules of civil procedure , adopted in 1938 to govern civil procedure in the united states district courts , provide that there is only one form of action in civil cases , and explicitly abolish certain writs by name in an attempt to purge latin from the language of the law , california law has for many years used the term writ of mandate in place of writ of mandamus , and writ of review in place of writ of certiorari the due process for petitions for such writs is not simply civil or criminal , because they incorporate the presumption of non-authority , so that the official who is the respondent has the burden to prove his authority to do or not do something , failing which the court has no discretion but to decide for the petitioner , who may be any person , not just an interested party hein , buffalo , new york , a writ of exigent ( or exigend ) commands a sheriff to summon a defendant indicted for a felony , who had failed to appear in court , to deliver himself up upon pain of outlawry or forfeiture of his goods the supreme court , the highest in the country , may issue writs under article 32 of the constitution for enforcement of fundamental rights and under article 139 for enforcement of rights other than fundamental rights , while high courts , the superior courts of the states , may issue writs under articles 226 the constitution broadly provides for five kinds of '' prerogative '' writs : habeas corpus , certiorari , mandamus , quo warranto and prohibition : the writ of prohibition ( forbid ) is issued by a higher court to a lower court prohibiting it from taking up a case because it falls outside the jurisdiction of the lower court the writ of habeas corpus ( to have the body of ) is issued to a detaining authority , ordering the detainer to produce the detained person in the issuing court , along with the cause of his or her detention the writ of certiorari ( be informed ) is issued to a lower court directing that the record of a case be sent up for review , together with all supporting files , evidence , and documents , usually with the intention of overruling the judgment of the lower court the writ of mandamus ( command ) is issued to a subordinate court , an officer of the government , or a corporation or other institution commanding the performance of certain acts or duties
