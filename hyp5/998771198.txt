for so-called '' aerial '' species ( the majority of the common species in culture except tillandsia cyanea ) , that is to say those whose roots are transformed into crampons without any power of absorption , watering is done by the leaves in the form of frequent sprays , or brief soaking of the plant in a container full of water having native habitats that vary from being epiphytic and saxicolous , species have certain adaptations , such as root systems designed to anchor to other plants or substrates , and modified trichomes for water and nutrient intake the green species with their claim to a cool-humid climate live mostly more in the shade terrestrial or in the lower levels of the forests they prefer the full sun and can therefore be found in the upper floors of the woods , on rocks or ( rarely ) on the ground due to their minimal root and other adaptations , they generally do not require frequent watering , no more than four times a week , allowing the plant to completely dry before watering again for most species , the ideal growth temperature is between 20 °c and 25 °c , with a minimum of 10 °c and a maximum of 30 °c few are resistant to −10 °c , but some , usually from higher elevation areas , are hardy enough to withstand light and brief freezes and live outdoors year round in areas with mild winters they have naturally been established in diverse environments such as equatorial tropical rain forests , high elevation andes mountains , rock dwelling ( saxicolous ) regions , and louisiana swamps , such as spanish moss ( t publisher naturbuch verlag © 1992 weltbildverlag gmbh augsburg the amount of light required depends on the species ; overall , air plants with silver dusting and stiff foliage will require more sunlight than air plants with softer foliage some of the species , like the majority of bromeliaceae , grow as funnel bromeliads , with a compressed stem axis but there are also species that live lithophytic , so on rocks ( but also roofs and even telephone wires ) species of tillandsia photosynthesis through a process called cam cycle , where they close their stomata during the day to prevent water loss and open them at night to fix carbon dioxide and release oxygen file : bromeliacea tillandsia fasciculata swartz.jpg tillandsia fasciculata file : tillandsia funckiana 1.jpg tillandsia funckiana file : tillandsia-excelsa.jpg tillandsia excelsa , a green funnel bromeliad with green leaves and hanging inflorescence at the site file : 空氣鳳梨 20190405161625.jpg tillandsia the leaves are then close together in rosettes , and cover the lower areas of the leaves , forming a funnel for collecting water the flower 's color varies greatly ; red , yellow , purple and pink flowers exist in this genus , and multicolored flowers are known geographic structure in two highly diverse lineages of tillandsia ( bromeliaceae ) geographic structure in two highly diverse lineages of tillandsia ( bromeliaceae ) file : epífitas en los cables de la luz eléctrica.jpg tillandsia recurvata and another bromeliaceae species on electric wires near san juan de los morros , venezuela file : blushing bride airplant ( tillandsia ionantha )
