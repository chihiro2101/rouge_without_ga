deliberative democracy holds that , for a democratic decision to be legitimate , it must be preceded by authentic deliberation , not merely the aggregation of preferences that occurs in voting authentic deliberation is deliberation among decision-makers that is free from distortions of unequal political power , such as power a decision-maker obtained through economic wealth or the support of interest groups ” social policy , summer , 1998 , pp 5-9 if the decision-makers can not reach consensus after authentically deliberating on a proposal , then they vote on the proposal using a form of majority rule the roots of deliberative democracy can be traced back to aristotle and his notion of politics ; however , the german philosopher jürgen habermas ' work on communicative rationality and the public sphere is often identified as a major work in this area in elitist deliberative democracy , principles of deliberative democracy apply to elite societal decision-making bodies , such as legislatures and courts ; in populist deliberative democracy , principles of deliberative democracy apply to groups of lay citizens who are empowered to make decisions one purpose of populist deliberative democracy can be to use deliberation among a group of lay citizens to distill a more authentic public opinion about societal issues but not directly create binding law ; devices such as the deliberative opinion poll have been designed to achieve this goal another purpose of populist deliberative democracy can be to serve as a form of direct democracy , where deliberation among a group of lay citizens forms a '' public will '' and directly creates binding law james fishkin , who has designed practical implementations of deliberative democracy for over 15 years in various countries , describes five characteristics essential for legitimate deliberation : : information : the extent to which participants are given access to reasonably accurate information that they believe to be relevant to the issue : substantive balance : the extent to which arguments offered by one side or from one perspective are answered by considerations offered by those who hold other perspectives : diversity : the extent to which the major position in the public are represented by participants in the discussion : conscientiousness : the extent to which participants sincerely weigh the merits of the arguments : equal consideration : the extent to which arguments offered by all participants are considered on the merits regardless of which participants offer them in fishkin 's definition of deliberative democracy , lay citizens must participate in the decision-making process , thus making it a subtype of direct democracy joshua cohen , a student of john rawls , outlined conditions that he thinks constitute the root principles of the theory of deliberative democracy , in the article '' deliberation and democratic legitimacy '' in the 1989 book the good polity the citizens in the democracy structure their institutions such that deliberation is the deciding factor in the creation of the institutions and the institutions allow deliberation to continue the citizens consider deliberative procedure as the source of legitimacy , and prefer the causal history of legitimation for each law to be transparent and easily traceable to the deliberative process cohen presents deliberative democracy as more than a theory of legitimacy , and forms a body of substantive rights around it based on achieving '' ideal deliberation '' : it is free in two ways : the participants consider themselves bound solely by the results and preconditions of the deliberation parties to deliberation are required to state reasons for their proposals , and proposals are accepted or rejected based on the reasons given , as the content of the very deliberation taking place in democracy and liberty , an essay published in 1998 , cohen reiterated many of these points , also emphasizing the concept of '' reasonable pluralism '' – the acceptance of different , incompatible worldviews and the importance of good faith deliberative efforts to ensure that as far as possible the holders of these views can live together on terms acceptable to all they define it as '' a form of government in which free and equal citizens and their representatives justify decisions in a process in which they give one another reasons that are mutually acceptable and generally accessible , with the aim of reaching decisions that are binding on all at present but open to challenge in the future '' a claimed strength of deliberative democratic models is that they are more easily able to incorporate science opinion and base policy on outputs of ongoing research , because : time is given for all participants to understand and discuss the science scientific peer review , adversarial presentation of competing arguments , refereed journals , even betting markets , are also deliberative processes '' according to proponents such as james fearon , another strength of deliberative democratic models is that they tend , more than any other model , to generate ideal conditions of impartiality , rationality and knowledge of the relevant facts deliberative democracy takes on the role of an '' epistemic democracy '' in this way , as it thus has an epistemic value : it allows participants to deduce what is morally correct james fishkin 's 1991 work , '' democracy and deliberation '' , introduced a way to apply the theory of deliberative democracy to real-world decision making , by way of what he calls the deliberative opinion poll in the deliberative opinion poll , a statistically representative sample of the nation or a community is gathered to discuss an issue in conditions that further deliberation the group is then polled , and the results of the poll and the actual deliberation can be used both as a recommending force and in certain circumstances , to replace a vote the political philosopher charles blattberg has criticized deliberative democracy on four grounds : ( i ) the rules for deliberation that deliberative theorists affirm interfere with , rather than facilitate , good practical reasoning ; ( ii ) deliberative democracy is ideologically biased in favor of liberalism as well as republican over parliamentary democratic systems ; ( iii ) deliberative democrats assert a too-sharp division between just and rational deliberation on the one hand and self-interested and coercive bargaining or negotiation on the other ; and ( iv ) deliberative democrats encourage an adversarial relationship between state and society , one that undermines solidarity between citizens although some of the seminal work was done in the 1970s and 80s , it was only in 1990 that deliberative democracy began to attract substantial attention from political scientists thus it usually involves an extensive outreach effort to include marginalized , isolated , ignored groups in decisions , and to extensively document dissent , grounds for dissent , and future predictions of consequences of actions on the other hand , many practitioners of deliberative democracy attempt to be as neutral and open-ended as possible , inviting ( or even randomly selecting ) people who represent a wide range of views and providing them with balanced materials to guide their discussions for example , with europolis 2009 , at the time one of the largest deliberative assemblies ever held , which set out to assess the public 's view on a wide range of issues and included representatives from all 27 eu member nations , the share of citizens intending to vote for the greens increased from 8 % to 18 % bessette coined the term '' deliberative democracy '' in his 1980 work '' deliberative democracy : the majority principle in republican government '' , and went on to elaborate and defend the notion in '' the mild voice of reason '' ( 1994 ) this suggests that the deliberative capacity of a democratic system needs to be understood through the interconnection of the variety of sites of deliberation which exist , rather than any single setting organizations : americaspeaks concepts : anticipatory exclusion citizen oversight deliberation deliberative assembly deliberative opinion poll deliberative referendum mediated deliberation experiments in deliberative democracy citizens ' assembly ( ireland ) democracy agonistic democracy consensus democracy collaborative e-democracy demarchy direct democracy liquid democracy participatory democracy representative democracy group decision making consensus decision-making majority rule meritocracy online deliberation open source governance the people 's parliament citizens ' assembly public reason public sphere ralph nader 's concord principles royal commission bessette , joseph ( 1980 ) '' deliberative democracy : the majority principle in republican government , '' in how democratic is the constitution ? , washington , d.c centre for deliberative democracy and global governance , university of canberra , the world leading center in the growing field of deliberative democracy openforum.com.au , an online collaborative think tank , which invites people from all walks of life to engage with the political process , by participating directly in policy debates with politicians , business people , academics , senior public servants , and other interested parties national issues forums center for deliberative democracy , stanford university deliberative democracy consortium & mdash ;
