ranke wrote largely on the history of early modern europe , using the diplomatic archives of the european powers ( particularly the venetians ) to construct a detailed understanding of the history of europe wie es eigentlich gewesen ( '' as it actually happened '' ) ranke saw diplomatic history as the most important kind of history to write because of his idea of the '' primacy of foreign affairs '' ( primat der aussenpolitik ) , arguing that the concerns of international relations drive the internal development of the state ranke 's understanding of the dominance of foreign policy , and hence an emphasis on diplomatic history , remained the dominant paradigm in historical writing through the first half of the twentieth century this emphasis , combined with the effects of the war guilt clause in the treaty of versailles ( 1919 ) which ended the first world war , led to a huge amount of historical writing on the subject of the origins of the war of 1914 , with the involved governments printing huge , carefully edited , collections of documents and numerous historians writing multi-volume histories of the origins of the war taylor , struggle for mastery in europe

close associate klaus hildebrand , was involved in a very acrimonious debate with the leftish german historian hans-ulrich wehler over the merits of the primat der aussenpolitik ( '' primacy of foreign politics '' ) and primat der innenpolitik ( '' primacy of domestic politics '' ) schools hillgruber and hildebrand made a case for the traditional primat der aussenpolitik approach to diplomatic history with the stress on examining the records of the relevant foreign ministry and studies of the foreign policy decision-making elite wehler , who favored the primat der innenpolitik approach , for his part contended that diplomatic history should be treated as a sub-branch of social history , calling for theoretically-based research , and argued that the real focus should be on the study of the society in question moreover , under the influence of the primat der innenpolitik approach , diplomatic historians in the 1960s , 70s and 80s start to borrow models from the social sciences in mason 's view in the period between 1936 and 1941 , it was the state of the german economy , and not hitler 's '' will '' or '' intentions '' that was the most important determinate on german decision-making on foreign policy according to mason , by 1939 , the “ overheating ” of the german economy caused by rearmament , the failure of various rearmament plans produced by the shortages of skilled workers , industrial unrest caused by the breakdown of german social policies , and the sharp drop in living standards for the german working class forced hitler into going to war at a time and place not of his choosing kaillis , aristotle fascist ideology , london : routledge , 2000 pages 165-166 mason contended that when faced with the deep socio-economic crisis the nazi leadership had decided to embark upon a ruthless “ smash and grab ” foreign policy of seizing territory in eastern europe which could be pitilessly plundered to support living standards in germany “

the japanese historian chihiro hosoya , the british historian ian nish , and the american historian akira iriye , which was the first time that asian specialists became noted diplomatic historians the vietnam war led to the rise of a revisionist school in the united states , which led many american historians such as gabriel kolko and william appleman williams to reject traditional diplomatic history in favor of a primat der innenpolitik approach that saw a widespread examination of the influence of american domestic politics together with various social , economic and cultural forces on foreign-policy making in general , the american cold war revisionists tended to focus on american foreign policy decision-making with respect to the genesis of the cold war in the 1940s and on how the united states became involved in vietnam in the 1960s since the collapse of communism in 1989–91 , however , there has been a renaissance , led especially by historians of the early modern era , in
