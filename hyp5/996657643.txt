he attacked kildare in 964 , and it was a target again in 967 when muiredach mac faeláin , abbot of kildare , a member of the uí dúnlainge kindred which ruled leinster , was killed by amlaíb and cerball mac lorcáin , a kinsman of muiredach 's the northumbrian submission to eadred led to a meeting with the notables of york led by archbishop wulfstan in 947 , but the following year king erik was back ruling northumbria and eadred laid waste to the southern parts of the kingdom— ripon is mentioned as a particular target—to force the northumbrians to expel erik , which they did the ímar from whom the uí ímair were descended is generally presumed to be that ímar ( english pronunciation ivar ) : '' king of the northmen of all britain and ireland '' , whose death is reported by the annals of ulster in 873 the uí ímair in ireland had also suffered in 944 as dublin was sacked that year by the high king of ireland congalach cnogba , whose power base lay in brega , north of dublin on the lower reaches of the river boyne sitriuc 's other sons included gofraid ( died 951 ) , king of dublin , aralt ( died 940 ) , ruler of limerick , and , less certainly , sichfrith and auisle , listed among those killed at the battle of brunanburh in 937 by the annals of clonmacnoise the basic argument presented is that amlaíb mac gofrith did not rule in york and the suggestion that only one amlaíb , amlaíb cuarán , was king there may explain some of the apparent anomalies in the numismatic record the monastery on lindisfarne , in the kingdom of northumbria , was sacked on 8 june 793 , and the monastery of iona in the kingdom of the picts was attacked in 795 and 802 according to william of malmesbury , who states that he did not know the princess 's name , she was æthelstan 's full sister , daughter of edward the elder and his first wife ecgwynn , john of wallingford gives her name as orgiue , perhaps eadgifu ; hudson , viking pirates , pp amlaíb 's father sitriuc first appears in the record in 917 when he seized dublin , a settlement which had probably been under the control of an irish king since the expulsion of the previous viking rulers in 902 domnall claen may have been a personal enemy of amlaíb as he had killed amlaíb 's father-in-law murchad mac finn '' deceitfully '' in 972 ; hudson , '' óláf sihtricson '' ; annals of ulster , au 972.2 in 937 an attack on æthelstan 's kingdom by gofraid 's son amlaíb , assisted by constantín mac áeda , the king of alba , and owen , the king of strathclyde , ended in defeat at the battle of brunanburh following sitriuc 's death , amlaíb may have become king in york for a short time , thus keynes , '' rulers of the english '' , p amlaíb cuarán 's career began in 941 , following the death of his cousin amlaíb mac gofrith , when he became co-ruler of york , sharing power with his cousin ragnall mac gofrith until the late 960s domnall ua néill , congalach 's successor as would-be high king , was occupied with enemies close to home , and in connacht and munster , and did not intervene in leinster or the hinterlands of dublin hudson , '' óláf sihtricson '' , presumes amlaíb to have been born in york , in which case he was a child at this time two years later one sitriuc cam—cam means crooked or twisted and cammán is simply the hypocoristic form of this byname , so that sitriuc cam and cammán are presumed to be the same person—was defeated by the dubliners led by amlaíb cuarán and the leinstermen while raiding in leinster this defeat appears to have lost amlaíb his kingship , as the annals record that blácaire , not amlaíb , was the leader of the dublin forces in the following year the dating of events in the period between the death of æthelstan and the expulsion of amlaíb and ragnall is uncertain as the various versions of the anglo-saxon chronicle are in conflict again , whether this was aimed against amlaíb , who was deposed in 952 and replaced by erik , or was mounted against king erik in support of amlaíb , is unclear amlaíb 's son ragnall ( rögnvaldr ) was among the dead in the battle which followed , and although several kings fighting alongside máel sechnaill were killed , the result was clearly a crushing blow for dublin amlaíb 's former ally domnall son of congalach had died in 976 , removing one potential rival , and as amlaíb had killed two of domnall ua néill 's sons he may have cleared the way for máel sechnaill to take power the following year , 949 , by which time blacáire was dead and amlaíb 's brother ruling in dublin , the northumbrians invited amlaíb to rule in york a daughter of sitriuc named gytha is said in the heimskringla to have married norway pirate king olaf tryggvason , but she was probably a daughter of amlaíb cuarán the following year , perhaps as a result of the sack of dublin , amlaíb 's cousin blácaire was driven out and amlaíb replaced him as ruler of dublin amlaíb cuarán ( olaf kvaran ) is referred to at least twice in the icelandic sagas , once in njal 's saga and again in saga of gunnlaugr serpent-tongue monasterboice and dunleer were burned after the battle and fighting spread to the lands of clann cholmáin the following year when domnall ua néill 's enemies there drove him out , only for him to return with an army and ravage both mide and the lands around dublin before marching south to attack leinster he was evidently ransomed or released as he was killed , along with muiredach mac riain of uí cheinnselaig of south leinster , fighting against the dubliners in 978 at belan ( county kildare ) erik 's reign was short and the viking kingdom of york was definitively incorporated into the kingdom of the english on his death in 954 according to the annals of clonmacnoise , amlaíb had been in britain since 940 , having left another son of gofraid , blácaire , as ruler of dublin amlaíb 's other children included gytha , who married olaf tryggvason , máel muire , who married máel sechnaill mac domnaill , and harald , possibly the grandfather of godred crovan it is not clear when in the period between 940 and 943 these events took place , and as a result historians disagree as to whether they concern amlaíb mac gofrith or amlaíb cuarán while edmund certainly controlled northumbria after amlaíb was expelled and ragnall killed , he may soon after have lost control of the north to a scandinavian king named eiríkr , usually identified with eric bloodaxe domnall 's army , which included allies from ulaid , was defeated , and ardgal mac matudáin , king of ulaid , and cináed mac crongilla , king of conaille muirtheimne , were among those killed the marriage linked amlaíb not only to the northern uí néill kindred of cenél neógain , but also to the southern clann cholmáin as he was now stepfather to dúnflaith 's young son máel sechnaill mac domnaill this threat was perhaps what led to congalach 's death in an ambush at dún ailinne ( modern county kildare ) or at tech guigenn in the region of the river liffey while collecting tribute in leinster in 956 amlaíb 's byname , cuarán , is usually translated as '' sandal '' or '' shoe '' portland in the kingdom of wessex in south-west britain was attacked during the reign of king beorhtric of wessex ( ruled from 786 to 802 ) he was succeeded by his son glúniairn ( járnkné , literally '' iron knee '' ) , son of his wife dúnlaith , daughter of muirchertach mac néill congalach 's rival ruaidrí was also dead , leaving amlaíb 's former ally as undisputed high king and thus a serious threat to dublin and the south-eastern irish kingdom of leinster máel sechnaill had become king of mide and head of clann cholmáin in 975 and had inaugurated his reign with an attack on his stepfather when he burned '' thor 's wood '' outside dublin the dubliners too had allies as the irish annals record the presence of warriors from the isle of man or the hebrides the main beneficiary was the brother of amlaíb 's new wife dúnflaith , domnall ua néill , who became the next high king of ireland during the second quarter of the century the frequency and size of raids increased and the first permanent viking settlements ( called longphorts in ireland ) appeared the anglo-saxon chronicle reports that '' king edmund conquered all northumbria and caused to flee away two kings or '' royally-born men '' , olaf and rægnald '' in 977 , in unknown circumstances , domnall ua néill 's sons congalach and muirchertach were killed and amlaíb is given credit for their deaths by the annals
