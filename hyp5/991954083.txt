left left meg signals were first measured by university of illinois physicist david cohen in 1968 , before the availability of the squid , using a copper induction coil as the detector this was cumbersome , and , in the 1980s , meg manufacturers began to arrange multiple sensors into arrays to cover a larger area of the head more recently , in 2017 , researchers built a working prototype that uses serf magnetometers installed into portable individually 3d-printed helmets , which they noted in interviews could be replaced with something easier to use in future , such as a bike helmet the brain 's magnetic field , measuring at 10 femtotesla ( ft ) for cortical activity and 10 3 ft for the human alpha rhythm , is considerably smaller than the ambient magnetic noise in an urban environment , which is on the order of 10 8 ft or 0.1 μt the essential problem of biomagnetism is , thus , the weakness of the signal relative to the sensitivity of the detectors , and to the competing environmental noise bundles of these neurons that are orientated tangentially to the scalp surface project measurable portions of their magnetic fields outside of the head , and these bundles are typically located in the sulci since the magnetic signals emitted by the brain are on the order of a few femtoteslas , shielding from external magnetic signals , including the earth 's magnetic field , is necessary the ferromagnetic layer is supplied as 1 & nbsp ; mm sheets , while the innermost layer is composed of four sheets in close contact , and the outer two layers are composed of three sheets each the challenge posed by meg is to determine the location of electric activity within the brain from the induced magnetic fields outside the head problems such as this , where model parameters ( the location of the activity ) have to be estimated from measured data ( the squid signals ) are referred to as inverse problems ( in contrast to forward problems where the model parameters ( e.g another common technique is beamforming , wherein a theoretical model of the magnetic field produced by a given current dipole is used as a prior , along with second-order statistics of the data in the form of a covariance matrix , to calculate a linear weighting of the sensor array ( the beamformer ) via the backus–gilbert method if one 's goal is to estimate the current density within the human brain with say a 5mm resolution then it is well established that the vast majority of the information needed to perform a unique inversion must come not from the magnetic field measurement but rather from the constraints applied to the problem the two sets of data are combined by measuring the location of a common set of fiducial points marked during mri with lipid markers and marked during meg with electrified coils of wire that give off magnetic fields the locations of the fiducial points in each data set are then used to define a common coordinate system so that superimposing the functional meg data onto the structural mri data ( '' coregistration '' ) is possible a criticism of the use of this technique in clinical practice is that it produces colored areas with definite boundaries superimposed upon an mri scan : the untrained viewer may not realize that the colors do not represent a physiological certainty , because of the relatively low spatial resolution of meg , but rather a probability cloud derived from statistical processes a widely accepted source-modeling technique for meg involves calculating a set of equivalent current dipoles ( ecds ) , which assumes the underlying neuronal sources to be focal automated multiple dipole model algorithms such as multiple signal classification ( music ) and msst ( multistart spatial and temporal ) modeling are applied to the analysis of meg responses the limitations of dipole models for characterizing neuronal responses are ( 1 ) difficulties in localizing extended sources with ecds , ( 2 ) problems with accurately estimating the total number of dipoles in advance , and ( 3 ) dependency on dipole location , especially depth in the brain as the number of unknown dipole moments is much greater than the number of meg sensors , the inverse solution is highly underdetermined , so additional constraints are needed to reduce ambiguity of the solution meg can resolve events with a precision of 10 milliseconds or faster , while functional mri ( fmri ) , which depends on changes in blood flow , can at best resolve events with a precision of several hundred milliseconds the clinical uses of meg are in detecting and localizing pathological activity in patients with epilepsy , and in localizing eloquent cortex for surgical planning in patients with brain tumors or intractable epilepsy knowing the exact position of essential brain regions ( such as the primary motor cortex and primary sensory cortex , visual cortex , and areas involved in speech production and comprehension ) helps to avoid surgically induced neurological deficits meg studies assist in clarification of the functional organization of primary somatosensory cortex and to delineate the spatial extent of hand somatosensory cortex by stimulation of the individual digits its strengths consist in independence of head geometry compared to eeg ( unless ferromagnetic implants are present ) , non-invasiveness , use of no ionizing radiation , as opposed to pet and high temporal resolution as opposed to fmri magnetic fields are less distorted than electric fields by the skull and scalp , which results in a better spatial resolution of the meg scalp eeg can , therefore , detect activity both in the sulci and at the top of the cortical gyri , whereas meg is most sensitive to activity originating in sulci eeg is , therefore , sensitive to activity in more brain areas , but activity that is visible in meg can also be localized with more accuracy
