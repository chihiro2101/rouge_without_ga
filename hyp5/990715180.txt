one is how many terminals they have to connect them to other components : one-port elementsthese represent the simplest components , that have only two terminals to connect to for example , a transformer with three separate windings has six terminals and could be idealized as a three-port element ; the ends of each winding are connected to a pair of terminals which represent a port each element is defined by a relation between the state variables of the network : current , i ; voltage , v , charge , q ; and magnetic flux , \phi in the case of the current generator , q , the time integral of current , represents the quantity of electric charge physically delivered by the generator for a voltage generated by magnetic induction it is meaningful , but for an electrochemical source , or a voltage that is the output of another circuit , no physical meaning is attached to it voltage-controlled current source ( vccs ) generates a current based on a voltage elsewhere in the circuit , with respect to a specified gain , used to model field-effect transistors and vacuum tubes ( has infinite input impedance and infinite output impedance ) from this it is supposed that there is a theoretical fourth passive element since there are only five elements in total ( not including the various dependent sources ) found in linear network analysis the constitutive relations of the passive elements are given by ; ljiljana trajković , '' nonlinear circuits '' , the electrical engineering handbook ( ed : wai-kai chen ) , pp.75–77 , academic press , 2005 resistance : constitutive relation defined as f ( v , i ) 0 this is the case for all linear elements , but also for example , an ideal diode , which in circuit theory terms is a non-linear resistor , has a constitutive relation of the form v f ( i ) the fourth passive element , the memristor , was proposed by leon chua in a 1971 paper , but a physical component demonstrating memristance was not created until thirty-seven years later eetimes , 30 april 2008 , 'missing link ' memristor created , eetimes , 30 april 2008 engineers find 'missing link ' of electronics – 30 april 2008 researchers prove existence of new basic element for electronic circuits – 'memristor ' – 30 april 2008 with the advent of the memristor , each pairing of the four variables can now be related there are also two special non-linear elements which are sometimes used in analysis but which are not the ideal counterpart of any real component : nullator : defined as v i 0 norator : defined as an element which places no restrictions on voltage and current whatsoever networks built from the basic linear elements only are obliged to be reciprocal and so can not be used by themselves to represent a non-reciprocal system introduction of the gyrator also makes either capacitance or inductance non-essential since a gyrator terminated with one of these at port 2 will be equivalent to the other at port 1 however , transformer , capacitance and inductance are normally retained in analysis because they are the ideal properties of the basic physical components transformer , inductor and capacitor whereas a practical gyrator must be constructed as an active circuit a more refined model also includes a resistance in series with the voltage source , to represent the battery 's internal resistance ( which results in the battery heating and the voltage dropping when in use ) a more refined model also includes a series inductance , to represent the effects of its lead inductance ( resistors constructed as a spiral have more significant inductance ) a capacitance in parallel may be added to represent the capacitive effect of the proximity of the resistor leads to each other for example , on a first degree of approximation , a bipolar transistor may be represented by a variable current source that is controlled by the input current
