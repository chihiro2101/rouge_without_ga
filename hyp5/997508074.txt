it is theorized that the translocation of the 7q31.2 region of the foxp2 gene causes a severe language impairment called developmental verbal dyspraxia ( dvd ) or childhood apraxia of speech ( cas ) so far this type of mutation has only been discovered in three families across the world including the original ke family while foxp2 has been proposed to play a critical role in the development of speech and language , this view has been challenged by the fact that the gene is also expressed in other mammals as well as birds and fish that do not speak foxp2 and its gene were discovered as a result of investigations on an english family known as the ke family , half of whom ( 15 individuals across three generations ) suffered from a speech and language disorder called developmental verbal dyspraxia insertion of both human mutations into mice , whose version of foxp2 otherwise differs from the human and chimpanzee versions in only one additional base pair , causes changes in vocalizations as well as other behavioral changes , such as a reduction in exploratory tendencies , and a decrease in maze learning time the forkhead box p2 protein is active in the brain and other tissues before and after birth , many studies show that it is paramount for the growth of nerve cells and transmission between them foxp2 is expressed in many areas of the brain , including the basal ganglia and inferior frontal cortex , where it is essential for brain maturation and speech and language development further screening of the gene identified multiple additional cases of foxp2 disruption , including different point mutations and chromosomal rearrangements , providing evidence that damage to one copy of this gene is sufficient to derail speech and language development . in comparison to knockout mice with one non-functional copy of foxp2 , the humanized mouse model showed opposite effects when testing its effect on the levels of dopamine , plasticity of synapses , patterns of expression in the striatum and behavior that was exploratory in nature a 2018 analysis of a large sample of globally distributed genomes confirmed there was no evidence of positive selection , suggesting that the original signal of positive selection may be driven by sample composition when the researchers sequenced the foxp2 gene in the ke family , they found a heterozygous point mutation shared by all the affected individuals , but not in unaffected members of the family and other people transcription factors affect other regions , and the forkhead box p2 protein has been suggested to also act as a transcription factor for hundreds of genes in mice , the gene was found to be twice as highly expressed in male pups than female pups , which correlated with an almost double increase in the number of vocalisations the male pups made when separated from mothers in zebrafish , foxp2 is expressed in the ventral and dorsal thalamus , telencephalon , diencephalon where it likely plays a role in nervous system development three amino acid substitutions distinguish the human foxp2 protein from that found in mice , while two amino acid substitutions distinguish the human foxp2 protein from that found in chimpanzees , but only one of these changes is unique to humans there is some evidence that the linguistic impairments associated with a mutation of the foxp2 gene are not simply the result of a fundamental deficit in motor control using a combination of bioinformatics and rna analyses , they discovered that the gene codes for a novel protein belonging to the forkhead-box ( fox ) group of transcription factors knockout mice with no functional copies of foxp2 are runted , display abnormalities in brain regions such as the purkinje layer , and die an average of 21 days after birth from inadequate lung development the expression of foxp2 is subject to post-transcriptional regulation , particularly microrna ( mirna ) , which binds to multiple mirna binding-sites in the neocortex , causing the repression of the foxp2 3 ' untranslated region the human gene differs from that in non-human primates by the substitution of two amino acids , a threonine to asparagine substitution at position 303 ( t303n ) and an asparagine to serine substitution at position 325 ( n325s ) there is further evidence for mutations of targets of the foxp2 gene shown to have roles in schizophrenia , epilepsy , autism , bipolar disorder and intellectual disabilities mutations in foxp2 are among several ( 26 genes plus 2 intergenic ) loci which correlate to adhd diagnosis in adults â€“ clinical adhd is an umbrella label for a heterogeneous group of genetic and neurological phenomena which may result from foxp2 mutations or other causes differences between song-learning and non-song-learning birds have been shown to be caused by differences in foxp2 gene expression , rather than differences in the amino acid sequence of the foxp2 protein when analyzing the brain circuitry in these cases , scientists found greater levels of dopamine and decreased lengths of dendrites , which caused defects in long-term depression , which is implicated in motor function learning and maintenance only a few targeted genes have been identified , however researchers believe that there could be up to hundreds of other genes targeted by the foxp2 gene it has also been proposed that the foxp2 transcription-factor is not so much a hypothetical 'language gene ' but rather part of a regulatory machinery related to externalization of speech additionally , foxp2 is found more in the sixth layer of the cortex than in the fifth , and this is consistent with it having greater roles in sensory integration a study in germany sequenced foxp2 's complementary dna in chimps and other species to compare it with human complementary dna in order to find the specific changes in the sequence
