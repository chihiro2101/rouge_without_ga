ai science contributes to many fundamental research topics , including but not limited to : advanced statistics in archaeology , spatial and temporal archaeological data analysis bayesian analysis and advanced probability models , fuzziness and uncertainty in archaeological data scale-related phenomena and scale transgressions gis in archaeology ( representations of stratigraphy , 3d analysis , artefact distributions ) landscape analysis ( territorial modeling , visibility analysis ) optimal survey and sampling strategies process-based modeling and simulation models archaeological predictive modeling and heritage management applications supervised and unsupervised classification and typology , artificial intelligence applications digital excavations and virtual reality computational reproducibility of archaeological research archaeological software development , electronic data sharing and publishing ai science advocates a formalized approach to archaeological inference and knowledge building university college london : material culture and data science research group university of york : archaeological information systems research group university of southampton : archaeological computing research group university of birmingham : hp visual and spatial technology centre archaeological computing division foundation for research and technology hellas ( forth ) , center for cultural informatics alexandria archive institute ( aai ) internet and open source for archaeology ( 2004-2013 ) was a portal dedicated to the collection and creation of resources to help archaeologists evaluate open source alternatives to proprietary software algorithm and software design , database design and theory ) , geoinformation science ( geostatistics and modeling , geographic information systems ) , artificial intelligence research ( supervised classification , fuzzy logic ) , ecology ( point pattern analysis ) , applied mathematics ( graph theory , probability theory ) and statistics gis and spatial analysis in archaeology university of york : msc archaeological information systems university of birmingham : ma/ pg dip landscape archaeology , gis and virtual environments university of southampton : msc in archaeological computing ( spatial technologies ) and msc in archaeological computing ( virtual pasts ) archaeoinformatics at siena university ( italian page ) archaeoinformation science at cau kiel university of the aegean m.sc in cultural informatics university of washington digital archaeology research lab the computational archaeology lab at san diego state university focuses on open-science and open-source approaches to gis , agent based modeling , imagery analysis , and computation in archaeology and coupled human-natural systems science in germany , the country 's first lecturer 's position in ai science ( '' arch채oinformatik '' ) was established in 2005 at the university of kiel ( benjamin ducke , now at oxford archaeology ) , while currently there is only one regular junior professorship in archaeoinformatics in the field of classical archaeology at freie universit채t berlin cultural and educational technology institute is a research institute which constitutes an integrated research environment with continuous interaction with the academic community , in particular with the democritus university of thrace , the national and european educational and cultural technology industry , the international scientific community and the public sector the most important platform for students and researchers in quantitative archaeology and ai science is the international conference on computer applications and quantitative methods in archaeology ( caa ) which has been in existence for more than 30 years now and is held in a different city of europe each year in recent years , it has become clear that archaeologists will only be able to harvest the full potential of quantitative methods and computer technology if they become aware of the specific pitfalls and potentials inherent in the archaeological data and research process its agenda can be split up in two major research themes that complement each other : fundamental research ( theoretical ai science ) on the structure , properties and possibilities of archaeological data , inference and knowledge building roosevelt , cobb , moss , olson , and 체nl체soy 2015 : '' excavation is digitization : advances in archaeological practice , '' journal of field archaeology , volume 40 , issue 3 ( june 2015 ) , pp it incorporates a large part of the methods and theories developed in processual archaeology since the 1960s but goes beyond former attempts at quantifying archaeology by exploring ways to represent general archaeological information and problem structures as computer algorithms and data structures
