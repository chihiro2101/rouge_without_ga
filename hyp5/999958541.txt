by placing a miniature model of a dinosaur close to the camera , the director may make the dinosaur look monstrously tall to the viewer , even though it is just closer to the camera since miniature models would need to be subjected to far greater lighting than the main focus of the camera , the area of action , it is important to ensure that these can withstand the significant amount of heat generated by the incandescent light sources typically used in film and tv production an extensively used technique in the lord of the rings : the fellowship of the ring was an enhancement of this principle , which could be used in moving shots portions of sets were mounted on movable platforms which would move precisely according to the movement of the camera , so that the optical illusion would be preserved at all times for the duration of the shot a character then interacts with the object or character , in the process showing that the viewer has been fooled and there is forced perspective in use however , when the character walks up to the phone ( towards the camera ) and picks it up , it becomes apparent that the phone is extremely oversized instead of being close to the camera in the history of the world , part i , while escaping the french peasants , mel brooks ' character , jacques , who is doubling for king louis , runs down a hall of the palace , which turns into a ramp , showing the smaller forced perspective door at the end in architecture , a structure can be made to seem larger , taller , farther away or otherwise by adjusting the scale of objects in relation to the spectator , increasing or decreasing perceived depth when forced perspective is supposed to make an object appear farther away , the following method can be used : by constantly decreasing the scale of objects from expectancy and convention toward the farthest point from the spectator , an illusion is created that the scale of said objects is decreasing due to their distant location in film , photography and art , perceived object distance is manipulated by altering fundamental monocular cues used to discern the depth of an object in the scene such as aerial perspective , blurring , relative size and lighting this depends solely on the angle created by the rays coming from the topmost and bottommost part of the object that pass through the center of the lens of the eye the formula for calculating angular size is as follows : : \theta 2\tan^\right ) in which θ is the subtended angle , h is the actual size of the object and d is the distance from the lens to the object using the monocular cue of aerial perspective , the eye uses the relative luminescence of objects in a scene to discern relative distance a perceptive illusion that may be infused in film culture is the idea of gestalt psychology , which holds that people often view the whole of an object as opposed to the sum of its individual parts once the audience becomes acquainted with the size of an object in proportion to the rest of the objects in a scene , the photographer or filmmaker can replace the object with a larger or smaller replica to change another part of the scene 's apparent size for example , to aid in the appearance of a person as a giant next to a '' regular sized '' person , a filmmaker might have a shot of two identical glasses together , then follow with the person who is supposed to play the giant holding a much smaller replica of the glass and the person who is playing the regular-sized person holding a much larger replica this monocular cue takes advantage of the trend for the color of distant objects to shift towards the blue end of the spectrum , while the colors of closer objects shift toward the red end of the spectrum forced perspective has been employed to realize characters in film , such as hagrid , the half-giant in the harry potter series , and hobbits in the lord of the rings series in reality , there is only a 5-inch height difference between elijah wood , 5′6″ , and ian mckellen , 5′11″ , the actors playing frodo and gandalf in the lord of the rings films ; however , the use of camera angles and trick scenery and props creates the illusion of a much greater difference in size and height in his painting entitled still life with a curtain , paul cézanne creates the illusion of depth by using brighter colors on objects closer to the viewer and dimmer colors and shading to distance the '' light source '' from objects that he wanted to appear farther away typically , these displays use a tilted plane to represent what would otherwise be a level surface , incorporate a painted background of distant objects , and often employ false perspective , carefully modifying the scale of objects placed on the plane to reinforce the illusion through depth perception in which objects of identical real-world size placed farther from the observer appear smaller than those closer forced perspective is extensively employed at theme parks and other such architecture as found in disneyland and las vegas , often to make structures seem larger than they are in reality where physically larger structures would not be feasible or desirable , or to otherwise provide an optical illusion for entertainment value some notable examples of forced perspective in the parks , used to make the objects bigger , are the castles ( sleeping beauty , cinderella , and belle ) one of the most notable examples of forced perspective being used to make the object appear smaller is the american adventure pavilion in epcot file : sleeping beauty castle main-street.jpg at sleeping beauty castle in disneyland , the scale of architectural elements is much smaller in the upper reaches of the castle compared to the foundation , making it seem significantly taller than its actual height of 77 feet ( 23.470 meters )
