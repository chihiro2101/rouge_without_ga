the larger of these funds is the old-age and survivors insurance ( oasi ) trust fund , which holds in trust special interest-bearing federal government securities bought with surplus oasi payroll tax revenues the second , smaller fund is the disability insurance ( di ) trust fund , which holds in trust more of the special interest-bearing federal government securities , bought with surplus di payroll tax revenues 5 , 1990 , , provided that : notwithstanding any other provision of law , the receipts and disbursements of the federal old-age and survivors insurance trust fund and the federal disability insurance trust fund shall not be counted as new budget authority , outlays , receipts , or deficit or surplus for purposes of - ( 1 ) the budget of the united states government as submitted by the president , ( 2 ) the congressional budget , or ( 3 ) the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 if the trust funds begin running deficits , meaning more in benefits are paid out than contributions paid in , the social security administration is empowered to redeem the securities and use those funds to cover the deficit the board of trustees of the trust funds is composed of 6 members : secretary of the treasury ( the managing trustee ) , secretary of labor , secretary of health and human services , commissioner of social security , and 2 members appointed by the president and confirmed by the senate in the early 1980s , financial projections of the social security administration indicated near-term revenue from payroll taxes would not be sufficient to fully fund near-term benefits ( thus raising the possibility of benefit cuts ) the federal government appointed the national commission on social security reform , headed by alan greenspan ( who had not yet been named chairman of the federal reserve ) , to investigate what additional changes to federal law were necessary to shore up the fiscal health of the social security program the changes to federal law enacted in 1983 and signed by president reagan and pursuant to the recommendations of the greenspan commission advanced the time frame for previously scheduled payroll tax increases ( though it raised slightly the payroll tax for the self-employed to equal the employer-employee rate ) , changed certain benefit calculations , and raised the retirement age to 67 by the year 2027 1900 ) social security amendments of 1983-signed on april 20 , 1983 as of the end of calendar year 2010 , the accumulated surplus in the social security trust fund stood at just over 2.6 trillion social security benefits are paid from a combination of social security payroll taxes paid by current workers and interest income earned by the social security trust fund according to the projections of the social security administration , the trust fund will continue to show net growth until 2022 because the interest generated by its bonds and the revenue from payroll taxes exceeds the amount needed to pay benefits ( 756 billion in net contributions , 30 billion from taxation of benefits , 98 billion in interest , and less than 1 billion in reimbursements from the general fund of the treasury—almost exclusively resulting from the 2012 payroll tax legislation ) total expenditures from the combined oasdi trust funds amounted to 859 billion in 2014 '' social security board of trustees annual report-press release-july 27 , 2015 some basic equations for understanding the fund balance include : fund ending balance for a given year fund starting balance + program revenues + interest -
