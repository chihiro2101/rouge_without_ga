for specific combinations of orientations , perfect ( rather than statistical ) correlations between the three polarizations are predicted by both local hidden variable theory ( aka '' local realism '' ) and by quantum mechanical theory , and the predictions may be contradictory frequently considered cases of ghz experiments are concerned with observations obtained by three measurements , a , b , and c , each of which detects one signal at a time in one of two distinct mutually exclusive outcomes ( called channels ) : for instance a detecting and counting a signal either as ( a↑ ) or as ( a↓ ) , b detecting and counting a signal either as ( b « ) or as ( b » ) , and c detecting and counting a signal either as ( c ◊ ) or as ( c ♦ ) as a function only of the setting of this observer in this trial , and of one other hidden parameter λ , but without an explicit dependence on settings or outcomes concerning the other observers ( who are considered far away ) ? therefore : can the correlation numbers such as p ( a↑ ) ( b « ) ( c ◊ ) ( a x , b x , c x ) , be expressed as a product of such independent functions , a ( a x , λ ) , b ( b x , λ ) and c ( c x , λ ) , for all trials and all settings , with a suitable hidden variable value λ ? comparison with the product which defined p ( a↑ ) ( b « ) ( c ◊ ) ( j ) explicitly above , readily suggests to identify λ → j , a ( a x , j ) → ( n j ( a↑ ) − n j ( a↓ ) ) , b ( b x , j ) → ( n j ( b « ) − n j ( b » ) ) , and c ( c x , j ) → ( n j ( c ◊ ) − n j ( c ♦ ) ) , where j denotes any one trial which is characterized by the specific settings a x , b x , and c x , of a , b , and of c , respectively however , ghz and collaborators also require that the hidden variable argument to functions a ( ) , b ( ) , and c ( ) may take the same value , λ , even in distinct trials , being characterized by distinct experimental contexts taking the product of the last three equations , and noting that a ( a 1 , λ ) a ( a 1 , λ ) 1 , b ( b 1 , λ ) b ( b 1 , λ ) 1 , and c ( c 1 , λ ) c ( c 1 , λ ) 1 , yields : a ( a 2 , λ ) b ( b 2 , λ ) c ( c 2 , λ ) 1 in contradiction to the first equation ; 1 ≠ −1 with this assumption , p ( λ 1 ) can be determined by choosing the apparatus settings a 2 , b 2 , and c 2 , counting the number of triples for which the outcome is -1 , and dividing by the total number of triples observed at that setting prior to any measurements being made , the polarizations of the photons are indeterminate ; if a measurement is made on one of the photons using a two-channel polarizer aligned with the axes of the coordinate system , the photon assumes either horizontal or vertical polarization , with 50 % probability for each orientation , and the other two photons immediately assume the identical polarization for instance , if the polarization of two of the photons are measured and determined to be rotated +45° from horizontal , then local hidden variable theory predicts that the polarization of the third photon will also be +45° from horizontal
