it is common for patients suffering from micropsia to be able to indicate true size and distance despite their inability to perceive objects as they actually are in a case of one person with hemimicropsia asked to draw six symmetrical objects , the size of the picture on the left half was on average 16 % larger than the corresponding right half epileptiform abnormalities including spikes and sharp waves in the temporal lobe of the brain can diagnose this condition , which can in turn be the cause of an epilepsy patient 's micropsia for this test , patients are asked to look at a grid , and distortions or blank spots in the patient 's central field of vision can be detected after a set of trials , the overall pattern of responses should display a normal distance effect where the more similar the two circles , the higher the number of errors micropsia can occur during the aura phase of a migraine attack , a phase that often precedes the onset of a headache and is commonly characterized by visual disturbances micropsia , along with hemianopsia , quadrantopsia , scotoma , phosphene , teicopsia , metamorphopsia , macropsia , teleopsia , diplopia , dischromatopsia , and hallucination disturbances , is a type of aura that occurs immediately before or during the onset of a migraine headache the most common cause of seizures which produce perceptual disturbances such as micropsia and macropsia is temporal lobe epilepsy in which the seizures originate in the amygdala-hippocampus complex although drug-induced changes in perception usually subside as the chemical leaves the body , long-term cocaine use can result in the chronic residual effect of micropsia micropsia can be a symptom of hallucinogen persisting perception disorder , or hppd , in which a person can experience hallucinogenic flashbacks long after ingesting a hallucinogen micropsia may also be a symptom of psychological conditions in which patients visualize people as small objects as a way to control others in response to their insecurities and feelings of weakness micropsia can be caused by swelling of the cornea due to infection by the epstein-barr virus ( ebv ) and can therefore present as an initial symptom of ebv mononucleosis , a disease caused by epstein-barr virus infection macular degeneration typically produces micropsia due to the swelling or bulging of the macula , an oval-shaped yellow spot near the center of the retina in the human eye cscr is a disease in which a serous detachment of the neurosensory retina occurs over an area of leakage from the choriocapillaris through the retinal pigment epithelium ( rpe ) this causes a contradiction to arise between the true perception of an object 's size and the smaller perception of the object , and micropsic bias ultimately causes the individual to experience micropsia alice in wonderland syndrome , a neurological condition associated with both micropsia and macropsia , is named after lewis carroll 's famous 19th century novel alice 's adventures in wonderland it has been referred to as '' lilliput sight '' and '' lilliputian hallucination , '' a term coined by british physician raoul leroy in 1909 , based on the small people that inhabited the island of lilliput in the novel a number of surgical treatments are also being investigated for macular degeneration lesions that may not qualify for laser treatment , including macular translocation to a healthier area of the eye , displacement of submacular blood using gas , and removing membranes by surgery .
