'' 1 '' refers to amd k10-based units ( magny-cours and lisbon ) , '' 2 '' refers to the bulldozer-based interlagos , valencia , and zurich-based units , and '' 3 '' refers to the piledriver-based abu dhabi , seoul , and delhi-based units for all first , second , and third-generation opterons , the first digit ( the x ) specifies the number of cpus on the target machine : 1 – designed for uniprocessor systems 2 – designed for dual-processor systems 8 – designed for systems with 4 or 8 processors for socket f and socket am2 opterons , the second digit ( the z ) represents the processor generation new processors , launched in the third quarter of 2007 ( codename barcelona ) , incorporate a variety of improvements , particularly in memory prefetching , speculative loads , simd execution and branch predictor , yielding an appreciable performance improvement over k8-based opterons , within the same power envelope opteron combines two important capabilities in a single processor : native execution of legacy x86 32-bit applications without speed penalties native execution of x86-64 64-bit applications the first capability is notable because at the time of opteron 's introduction , the only other 64-bit architecture marketed with 32-bit x86 compatibility ( intel 's itanium ) ran x86 legacy-applications only with significant speed degradation in the february 2010 issue of custom pc ( a uk-based computing magazine focused on pc hardware ) , the amd opteron 144 ( released in summer 2005 ) appeared in the '' hardware hall of fame '' this socket supports magny-cours opteron 6100 , bulldozer-based interlagos opteron 6200 , and piledriver-based '' abu dhabi '' opteron 6300 series processors second-generation opterons are offered in three series : the 1000 series ( single socket only ) , the 2000 series ( dual socket-capable ) , and the 8000 series ( quad or octo socket-capable ) this is primarily because adding another opteron processor increases memory bandwidth , while that is not always the case for xeon systems , and the fact that the opterons use a switched fabric , rather than a shared bus official opteron homepage amd technical docs amd k8 opteron technical specifications amd k8 dual core opteron technical specifications interactive amd opteron rating and product id guide understanding the detailed architecture of amd 's 64 bit core comparison between xeon and opteron processor performance amd : dual-core opteron to 3 & nbsp ; ghz in a variety of computing benchmarks , the opteron architecture has demonstrated better multi-processor scaling than the intel xeon which did n't have a point to point system until qpi and integrated memory controllers with the nehalem design presently , only 2 ( dual-core , ddr2 ) , 3 ( quad-core , ddr2 ) and 4 ( six-core , ddr2 ) are used the affected processors may produce inconsistent results if three specific conditions occur simultaneously : the execution of floating point-intensive code sequences elevated processor temperatures elevated ambient temperatures a software verification tool for identifying the amd opteron processors listed in the above table that may be affected under these specific conditions is available , only to amd oem partners in 2007 amd introduced a scheme to characterize the power consumption of new processors under '' average '' daily usage , named average cpu power ( acp ) the second capability , by itself , is less noteworthy , as major risc architectures ( such as sparc , alpha , pa-risc , powerpc , mips ) have been 64-bit for many years amd announced its third-generation quad-core opteron chips on september 10 , 2007 with hardware vendors announcing servers in the following month except for the fact they have 1 mb l2 cache ( versus 512 kb for the athlon64 ) the socket 939 opterons are identical to the san diego and toledo core athlon 64s , but are run at lower clock speeds than the cores are capable of , making them more stable intel migrated to a memory architecture similar to the opteron 's for the intel core i7 family of processors and their xeon derivatives in multi-processor systems ( more than one opteron on a single motherboard ) , the cpus communicate using the direct connect architecture over high-speed hypertransport links this socket supports processors such as the santa rosa , barcelona , shanghai , and istanbul codenamed processors
