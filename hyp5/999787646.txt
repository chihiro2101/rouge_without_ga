thujone is found in a number of plants , such as thuja ( genus thuja , hence the derivation of the name ) , nootka cypress , some junipers , mugwort , oregano , common sage , tansy , and wormwood , most notably grand wormwood ( artemisia absinthium ) , usually as a mix of isomers in a 1:2 ratio the biosynthesis of thujone is similar to the synthesis of other monoterpenes and begins with the formation of geranyl diphosphate ( gpp ) from dimethylallyl pyrophosphate ( dmapp ) and isopentenyl diphosphate ( ipp ) , catalyzed by the enzyme geranyl diphosphate synthase from sabinene ( 8 ) , the proposed biosynthetic route to generate thujone follows a three-step pathway : sabinene is first oxidized to an isomer of ( + ) -sabinol ( 9-1,2 ) by a cytochrome p450 , followed by conversion to ( + ) -sabinone ( 10 ) via a dehydrogenase the isomerism of the ( + ) -sabinol intermediate varies among thujone-producing plants ; for instance , in the western redcedar ( thuja plicata ) , thujone is derived exclusively from the ( + ) -trans-sabinol intermediate ( 9-1 ) whereas in the garden sage ( salvia officinalis ) , thujone is formed from the ( + ) -cis-sabinol intermediate ( 9-2 ) modulation of ionotropic gaba receptors by natural products of plant origin the median lethal dose , or ld 50 , of alpha-thujone , the more active of the two isomers , in mice , is around 45 & nbsp ; mg/kg , with 0 % mortality rate at 30 & nbsp ; mg/kg and 100 % at 60 & nbsp ; mg/kg side effects from the essential oil of this plant include anxiety , sleeplessness , and convulsions , which confirms the central nervous system effects of thujone a 2008 study of 13 pre-ban ( 1895–1910 ) bottles using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry ( gc-ms ) found that the bottles had between 0.5 and 48.3 & nbsp ; mg/l and averaged 25.4 & nbsp ; mg/l absinthe myths finally laid to rest chemical composition of vintage preban absinthe with special reference to thujone , fenchone , pinocamphone , methanol , copper , and antimony concentrations a 2005 study recreated three 1899 high-wormwood recipes and tested with gc-ms , and found that the highest contained 4.3 & nbsp ; mg/l thujone in light of modern evidence , these conclusions are questionable , as they are based on a poor understanding of other compounds and diseases , and clouded by magnan 's belief that alcohol and absinthe were degenerating the french race 101-105 after absinthe was banned , research dropped off until the 1970s , when the british scientific journal nature published an article comparing the molecular shape of thujone to tetrahydrocannabinol ( thc ) , the primary psychoactive substance found in cannabis , and hypothesized it would act the same way on the brain , sparking the myth that thujone was a cannabinoid for example , sage and sage oil ( which can be up to 50 % thujone ) are on the food and drug administration 's list of generally recognized as safe ( gras ) substances absinthe offered for sale in the united states must be thujone-free by the same standard that applies to other beverages containing artemisia , so absinthe with small amounts of thujone may be legally imported δ ppm 2.54 ( ddd , j 18.8 , 2.3 , 1.1 & nbsp ; hz , 1h , h-2 ) , 2.21 ( q , j 7.2 & nbsp ; hz , 1h , h-4 ) , 2.07 ( d , j 18.8 & nbsp ; hz , 1h , h-2 ’ ) , 1.36 ( hept , j 6.8 & nbsp ; hz , 1h , h-7 ) , 1.15 ( d , j 7.5 & nbsp ; hz , 3h , h-9 ) , 1.08 ( dd , j 8.1 , 4.0 & nbsp ; hz , 1h , h-5 ) , 1.00 ( d , j 6.8 & nbsp ; hz , 3h , h-8 ) , 0.95 ( d , j 6.8 & nbsp ; hz , 3h , h-8 ’ ) 0.76 ( ddd , j 8.1 , 5.6 , 2.5 & nbsp ; hz , 1h , h-6 ) , 0.12 ( dd , j 5.6 , 4.1 & nbsp ; hz , 1h , h-6 ’ ) δ ppm 221.7 ( c o , c-3 ) , 47.5 ( ch , c-4 ) , 39.9 ( ch2 , c-2 ) , 33.1 ( ch , c-7 ) , 29.8 ( c , c-1 ) , 25.7 ( ch , c-5 ) , 20.1 ( ch3 , c-8 ) , 19.9 ( ch3 , c-8 ’ ) 18.9 ( ch3 , c-9 ) , 18.4 ( ch2 , c-6 ) the www.webbook.nist.gov website lists the m/z ratios for thujone as : 110 ( 100 ) , 81 ( ~89 ) , 95 ( ~71 ) ; 67 ( ~69 ) , 109 ( ~44 ) absinthe absolved , cern courier , july 8 , 2008 thujone.info — databank of peer reviewed articles on thujone , absinthe , absinthism , and independent thujone ratings of some commercial brands
