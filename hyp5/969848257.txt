vetustovermis ( from latin : '' very old worm '' ) is a soft-bodied middle cambrian animal , known from a single reported fossil specimen from the south australian emu bay shale petalilium ( sometimes misspelled petalium ) is an enigmatic genus of cambrian organism known from the haikou area , from the maoshoiatan mudstone member of the chengjiang biota it was later considered an arthropod , and in 2010 smith and caron , agreeing that petalilium was at least a close relative of vetustovermis ( but that treating it as a synonym was premature , given the poor preservation of the vetustovermis type ) , placed it with nectocaris in the clade nectocarididae whether nectocaris represents a derived or basal cephalopod , and whether it belongs in the crown group , it is more parsimonious to interpret its distinctive features as homologues of their equivalent in cephalopods – even if the absence of a shell in nectocaris is an independent feature & nbsp ; pteryx , there seem to be two discrete morphs , one large ( ~10 & nbsp ; cm in length ) , one small ( ~3 & nbsp ; cm long ) – 3d animations are available and a more detailed consideration of nectocaris – brian switek discusses the taxonomy and history of nectocaris in his blog – bbc news coverage of the smith & caron 's ( 2010 ) re-description – a blog article supporting mazurek & zatoń 's ( 2011 ) view although nectocaris is known from canada , china and australia , in rocks spanning some 20 & nbsp ; million years , there does not seem to be much diversity ; size excepted , all specimens are anatomically very similar charles doolittle walcott , the discoverer of the burgess shale , had photographed the one specimen he had collected in the 1910s , but never had time to investigate it further according to these authors , nectocaris is best treated as a member incertae sedis of the arthropod group dinocaridida ( which includes the anomalocaridids ) , but they stopped short of formally changing the classification the interpretation would push back the origin of cephalopods by at least 30 & nbsp ; million years , much closer to the first appearance of complex animals , in the cambrian explosion , and implied that & ndash ; against the widespread expectation & ndash ; cephalopods evolved from non-mineralized ancestors
