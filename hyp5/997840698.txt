following the attacks on the united states on september 11 , 2001 , united states ' popular opinion was seemingly for an invasion of iraq when asked whether or not the united states should attack a country that has not attacked the united states first , the american public 's opinion was in support with 51 % , whereas when iraq was embedded into the question the attitude shifted and there was a shift to 66 % of americans agreeing that u.s original concerns included , 55 percent of americans fearing that the war would last too long , 44 percent taking in consideration a mass number of casualties , 62 percent of the public being convinced that this would increase short-term terrorism domestically , 76 felt there would be a higher risk of domestic bioterrorism , and 35 believed that the draft would need to be reinstated however , about 60 % of those polled also supported , if necessary , the use of military action to remove hussein from power which closely mirrored recent polls taken by time magazine , cnn , fox news , usa today , cbs news , and other news organizations for example , an abc news poll reported that only 10 % of americans favored giving the inspectors less than a few weeks ; 41 % favored giving them a few weeks , 33 % a few months , and 13 % more than that a consistent pattern in the months leading up to the u.s.-led invasion was that higher percentages of the population supported the impending war in polls that offered only two options ( for or against ) than in polls that broke down support into three or more options given ( distinguishing unconditional support for the war , opposition to the war even if weapons inspectors do their job , and support if and only if inspection crews are allowed time to investigate first ) the gallup poll , for example , found that 67 % of those who watched the speech felt that the case had been made , which was a jump from 47 % just prior the speech tim russert , nbc 's washington bureau chief , said the increases in support were '' largely '' due to president bush 's state of the union speech in january and to powell 's presentation on february 5 , which most viewers felt offered strong evidence for action against iraq according to a gallup poll conducted from august 2002 through early march 2003 , the number of americans who favored the war in iraq fell to between 52 percent to 59 percent , while those who opposed it fluctuated between 35 percent and 43 percent an abc news/washington post poll taken after the beginning of the war showed a 62 % support for the war , lower than the 79 % in favor at the beginning of the persian gulf war out of the 72 percent who reported supporting the war , 59 percent reported supporting the war strongly , and although allied commanders said they had not yet found evidence of weapons of mass destruction days after the initial invasion , 9 out of 10 americans believed it was '' at least somewhat likely '' that the united states would find evidence of these weapons a cbs poll showed that 54 % of americans believed the iraq invasion was the right thing to do , up from 45 % in july in the same poll in the year leading up to the presidential election in 2004 ( november 3 , 2003 , and october 31 , 2004 ) public opinion began to fluctuate significantly in response to major events in the war , including the capture of saddam hussein capture and the scandal at abu ghraib prison cnn reporter howard kurtz reported that the news coverage of the war in the beginning of the topic was too one-sided , writing , '' from august 2002 through the march 19 , 2003 , launch of the war , i found more than 140 front-page stories that focused heavily on administration rhetoric against iraq : 'cheney says iraqi strike is justified ' ; 'war cabinet argues for iraq attack ' once it was discovered that there were no weapons of mass destruction in 2004 , the new york times quickly apologized for its rhetoric , stating that its coverage was '' not as rigorous as it should have been '' and that the times overplayed stories with '' dire claims about iraq '' public support went '' from a high of more than 55 % in mid-december immediately after the capture of saddam hussein , to a low of 39 % in mid to late june just before the u.s 51 % of those polled felt america should have stayed out of iraq , 44 % said the invasion was the right thing to do , with 5 % unsure a cnn poll taken on december 15–17 , 2006 , found that 67 % polled opposed the war in iraq , but that only and that a majority of 54 % believed in an exit over the next year the same poll found that 66 % believed neither side was winning and only 26 % of respondents agreed america should stay '' as long as it takes '' the same poll finds that 82 % believe the democrats have not developed a '' clear plan '' and 76 % believe the same is true of president bush on september 10–12 , in an associated press-ipsos poll of 1,000 adults conducted by ipsos public affairs , 33 % approved of george bush 's handling of the '' situation in iraq '' , while 65 % disapproved of it before president bush 's term comes to an end , passing off the iraqi war to the next president , the conflicting countries sign a status of forces agreement where it is understood that u.s at the conclusion of the iraq war in 2011 , washington post journalist peyton craighill expressed that , in the seemingly poisoned atmosphere of american politics , president obama 's directive to withdraw u.s public opinion towards the overall success of the invasion of iraq was at an all-time low in january 2014 following president obama 's decision to pull troops out of the area in a poll conducted by pew research center , 52 % of those polled said in achieving its goals in iraq , the united states has failed as of march 2018 , 48 % of americans polled responded the invasion was the wrong decision , 43 % saying it was the right decision , up 4 % from 2014 on the other side of the aisle , democrats have stayed fairly consistent in their views on the conflict , only shifting one percent in the past four years ( 28 % to 27 % positive view of the war ) support our troops iraq disarmament crisis opposition to the iraq war protests against the iraq war protests against the invasion of afghanistan 2003 invasion of iraq governments ' positions pre-2003 invasion of iraq public relations preparations for 2003 invasion of iraq united nations security council and the iraq war lafayette hillside memorial international public opinion on the war in afghanistan list of congressional opponents of the iraq war
