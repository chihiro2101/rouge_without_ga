two major methods for collecting crime data are law enforcement reports , which only reflect crimes that are reported , recorded , and not subsequently canceled ; and victim study ( victimization statistical surveys ) , which rely on individual memory and honesty for less frequent crimes such as intentional homicide and armed robbery , reported incidences are generally more reliable , but suffer from under-recording ; for example , no criming in the united kingdom sees over one third of reported violent crimes being not recorded by the police victims let down by poor crime-recording because laws and practices vary between jurisdictions , comparing crime statistics between and even within countries can be difficult : typically only violent deaths ( homicide or manslaughter ) can reliably be compared , due to consistent and high reporting and relative clear definition research using a series of victim surveys in 18 countries of the european union , funded by the european commission , has reported ( 2005 ) that the level of crime in europe has fallen back to the levels of 1990 , and notes that levels of common crime have shown declining trends in the u.s however , the european research suggests that '' increased use of crime prevention measures may indeed be the common factor behind the near universal decrease in overall levels of crime in the western world '' , since decreases have been most pronounced in property crime and less so , if at all , in contact crimes as '' only causing pain '' is counted as assault in some countries , it let higher assault rates except in austria , finland , germany , the netherlands , portugal and sweden because of the difficulties in quantifying how much crime actually occurs , researchers generally take two approaches to gathering statistics about crime however , as officers can only record crime that comes to their attention and might not record a matter as a crime if the matter is considered minor and is not perceived as a crime by the officer concerned in these surveys it is the participant 's perception , or opinion , that a crime occurred , or even their understanding about what constitutes a crime that is being measured the surveys show that the need to make an insurance claim , seek medical assistance , and the seriousness of an offence tend to increase the level of reporting , while the inconvenience of reporting , the involvement of intimate partners and the nature of the offending tend to decrease reporting crime-statistics.co.uk , uk crime statistics and crime statistic comparisons a continent of broken windows â€“ alexander , gerard the weekly standard ( volume 11 , issue 10 , 21 november 2005 ) united states : uniform crime report -- state statistics from 1960 - 2005 experience and communication as explanations for criminal risk perception regional crime rates 2011 crime statistics for 2013 released , fbi
