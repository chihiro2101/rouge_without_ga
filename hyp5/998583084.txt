in 1993 another official attempt to create a '' super-orchestra '' at the expense of one or more of the existing london ensembles briefly damaged relations between the lpo and the philharmonia , but the idea was quickly abandoned , and in 1995 , with the consent of the arts council , the two orchestras agreed to share the residency at the festival hall unlike its london rivals the rpo and the philharmonia ( both of whom recorded for many years only for emi and its associates , with the rarest of exceptions ) , the post-war lpo was not exclusively associated with one company , and as well as decca it recorded for philips , cbs , rca , chandos and many other labels solti stepped down at the end of the jubilee season , and was succeeded by klaus tennstedt , of whom the times commented , '' tennstedt found the orchestra sensitive and flexible , and his players regarded him with a warmth that is by no means universally extended by musicians to their conductors '' '' why all those insults made me stronger '' , the daily telegraph , 18 august 2005 he brought with him a recording contract with emi , but management turnover , financial stresses , and political disputes at the southbank centre at the time contributed to the difficulty of the working atmosphere in the orchestra among the composers with whom haitink was associated were bruckner and mahler , whose symphonies featured frequently in the lpo 's concerts during the haitink period , as did those of shostakovich , particularly the tenth , which pirouet describes as the calling card of the orchestra and conductor tennstedt 's resignation was a severe blow to the orchestra , and there was no obvious successor : morrison observed that the best-known conductors – barenboim , riccardo muti and simon rattle – with whom the orchestra was then associated were committed to other projects until the 1990s , and those possible contenders such as semyon bychkov and franz welser-möst were largely unknown in london pritchard was also music director of glyndebourne festival opera in sussex , and it was partly due to his influence that in 1964 the lpo replaced the rpo as glyndebourne 's resident orchestra , providing the players with stable guaranteed work in the slack summer months under masur , known for his performances of the german symphonic repertoire , the orchestra regained its musical form , and the critic richard s ginell commented that vladimir jurowski , who took over in 2007 '' has inherited an lpo in splendid technical shape , probably having been drilled to a fare-thee-well under masur '' he continued to appear with the lpo as a guest , with the title of '' conductor laureate '' ; in 1989 richard morrison of the times wrote that the lpo still played better for tennstedt than for anyone else on this occasion the targets were the lpo and the new philharmonia ; the latter , a self-governing body formed under its new name when the philharmonia was disbanded in 1964 , was going through a bad patch , professionally and financially for some years in the 1950s and 1960s the orchestra was contracted to two companies at once , and consequently appeared under the name '' the philharmonic promenade orchestra '' in some of its recordings from its outset in 1932 , harpists ( traditionally female ) excepted , the orchestra had maintained beecham 's '' men only '' regime ; in 1963 the rule was dropped , the first woman violinist was recruited , and within two years female players achieved equal conditions of membership with their male colleagues later scores have included those for antony and cleopatra ( 1972 ) , jesus christ superstar ( 1973 ) , disney 's tron ( 1982 ) , the fly ( 1986 ) , dead ringers ( 1988 ) , in the name of the father ( 1993 ) , the lord of the rings trilogy ( 2001–03 ) and most of the music for the three films derived from the hobbit ( 2012–14 ) like his lpo predecessors pritchard and haitink , jurowski also served as music director of glyndebourne ( 2001–2013 ) , where he conducted the lpo there in operas by britten , mozart , puccini , richard strauss , verdi , wagner , and others in most lpo recordings for lyrita the conductor was boult ; in the same period he also recorded extensively for emi , with the lpo his preferred orchestra the orchestra has made many non-classical recordings , including such titles as hawaiian paradise ( 1959 ) , evita ( 1976 ) , broadway gold ( 1978 ) , folk music of the region of asturias ( 1984 ) , academy award themes ( 1984 ) , japanese light music ( 1993 ) , the symphonic music of pink floyd ( 1994 ) and the symphonic music of the who ( 1995 ) in 1984 the lpo and the philharmonia began negotiations that went on for years following an arts council proposal to name one london orchestra as the principal resident orchestra of the festival hall , with concomitant extra funding pirouet comments that as haitink recorded exclusively for the dutch firm philips it was to be expected that the amsterdam orchestra would be preferred , and in any case the lpo was recording extensively with boult , solti , daniel barenboim and many others during the interregnum , the orchestra inaugurated its '' roots classical fusions '' series , which aimed to combine musical traditions from around the world ; this was part of an education and community programme launched by the orchestra in the 1970s international tours continued , with itineraries taking in the us , western europe , the soviet union , and , in 1972 , china , long inaccessible to western musicians , where the orchestra met an enthusiastic welcome in april 2020 , the lpo announced the appointment of canellakis as its new principal guest conductor , the first female conductor ever named to the post , effective from september 2020 his concerts made a strong impression with the public , and within months the lpo was playing to ninety per cent capacity audiences at the festival hall , far outstripping the other london orchestras in 1973 , acting jointly with the lso , the lpo acquired and began restoring a disused church in southwark , converting it into the henry wood hall , a convenient and acoustically excellent rehearsal space and recording studio , opened in 1975 in 1973 the lpo was caught up in a recurring phenomenon of london orchestral life : the conviction in official circles that having four independent orchestras is too much for one city , and that two or more of the existing ensembles should merge they range from early works such as cavalli 's l'ormindo ( recorded 1968 ) and glydebourne 's staging of handel 's theodora ( 1996 ) to central repertoire such as così fan tutte ( 1974 ) , carmen ( 1975 and 2002 ) and die meistersinger ( 2011 ) , and première recordings of 20th-century works including vaughan williams 's the pilgrim 's progress ( 1972 ) , shostakovich 's lady macbeth of mtsensk ( 1979 ) and eötvös 's love and other demons ( 2008 )
