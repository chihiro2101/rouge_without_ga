the aniseikonia inspector contains an aniseikonia test based on the same principles as the nat , but the test is run on a computer screen , it is based on a forced choice method , and it can measure the size difference as a function of the size of the objects macropsia arises from a compressed receptor distribution leading to a larger perceived image size and conversely , micropsia results from stretching of the retina leading to a more sparse receptor distribution that gives a smaller perceived image size in some cases , the effects of macropsia have been shown to be field dependent , in that the degree of visual distortion is related to the visual field angle the pathophysiology of the condition is not fully understood , but the timing of some episodic occurrences with the headaches suggests that there is a connection between macropsia and the vasoconstrictive phase of a migraine dysmetropsia in one eye , a case of aniseikonia , can present with symptoms such as headaches , asthenopia , reading difficulties , depth perception problems , or double vision the intensity of the macropsia episodes decreased with the decreasing amount of zolpidem administered ; it is implied in the article that the level of intensity was based on the patients accounts of her macropsia episodes , and that no external diagnosis was used if the compression forces were closer to the fovea the resulting compression would cause a greater amount of macropsia at lower field angles with little effect at higher field angles where the receptor distribution is not as compressed patients with both epstein-barr virus and infectious mononucleosis have cited an increase in the sizes of perceived objects , coinciding with other symptoms of alice in wonderland syndrome in cases where macropsia affects one eye resulting in differences in the way the two eyes perceive the size or shape of images , the condition is known as aniseikonia pediatrics 1979 ; 63 ; 517-519 the differences in visual phenomena , such as macropsia with slow motion versus macropsia without slow motion , may result from different areas of the brain being affected by migraine the macropsia episodes associated with migraine are typically equivalent to the duration of the aura , which can range from moments to 15 minutes macropsia may be a result of optical magnification differences between the eyes , retinal receptor distribution , or the cortical processing of the sampled image even in the absence of a migraine , a fever or a hypnagocic state can provoke visual illusions , which one might claim to be macropsia this method includes changing the shape of spectacle lenses , changing the vertex distances with contact lenses , creating a weak telescope system with contact lenses and spectacles , and changing the power of one of the spectacle lenses a person with macropsia may fail to see the connection between the migraine and the macropsia , since the conditions may not elicit symptoms at the same time the most common way to treat forms of aniseikonia , including macropsia , is through the use of auxiliary optics to correct for the magnification properties of the eyes the patient wears a pair of red/green goggles so that one eye is tested at a time , and the patient attempts to determine when the semicircles are the same size in the case of macropsia , the greater density of photoreceptor cells leads to greater stimulation making the object seem larger patients with coxsackievirus b1 have reported numerous symptoms of alice in wonderland syndrome , the most common of which being macropsia and micropsia a positive value indicates that the object was perceived bigger and thus corresponds to macropsia , and conversely a negative value indicates micropsia aniseikonia , metamorphopsia and perceived entoptic pattern : some effects of a macular epiretinal membrane , and the subsequent spontaneous separation of the membrane the current hypothesis for the occurrence of dysmetropsia is due to the stretching or compression of the retina leading to the displacement of receptors asymmetry has also been observed with retinoschisis , in which macropsia generally results in the vertical direction while micropsia presents in the horizontal direction computer software , such as the aniseikonia inspector , has been developed to determine the prescription needed to correct for a certain degree of aniseikonia due to the fear and anxiety associated with the condition , those who have previously suffered an episode hesitate to recount the episode , although retain the ability to do so the amsler grid test can be used to diagnose macropsia , along with other visual maladies depending on the subjective disturbance reported by the patient after looking at the amsler grid an alternative interpretation of the condition is that macropsia is a response to biophysiological contraction and has no psychological roots macropsia is generally diagnosed once a patient complains of the characteristic symptoms , such as disproportionally large objects in their visual field the new aniseikonia test ( nat ) can quantify the degree of macropsia or micropsia independently in the vertical and horizontal meridians vitreomacular traction caused by the excessive vitreomacular adhesion to the retina is related to aniseikonia due to the separation and compression of photoreceptor cells in terms of treatment , the most effective optical correction is still being researched with respect to visual field angles and direction to a target macropsia may present itself as a symptom of both frontal lobe epilepsy and temporal lobe epilepsy , which may actually help in the diagnosis of those diseases there are suggestions that visual distortions , such as macropsia , can be associated with cocaine use citalopram-induced macropsia is similar to zolpidem-induced macropsia since both types have been observed in relatively few cases , and neither of the drugs â€™ side effects can be supported by experimental evidence field dependent testing ) is especially important when the macropsia ( or micropsia ) has a retinal origin
