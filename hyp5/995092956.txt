pinhole lenses have a few severe limitations : a pinhole camera with a large aperture is blurry because each pixel is essentially the shadow of the aperture stop , so its size is no smaller than the size of the aperture ( third image ) a first step is to put a simple convex lens at the pinhole with a focal length equal to the distance to the film plane ( assuming the camera will take pictures of distant objects if the object is at a distance , one can assume the light rays will arrive perpendicular to the plane of the lens , and thus converge at the focal point this allows the pinhole to be opened up significantly ( fourth image ) because a thin convex lens bends light rays in proportion to their distance to the axis of the lens , with rays striking the center of the lens passing straight through the geometry is almost the same as with a simple pinhole lens , but rather than being illuminated by single rays of light , each image point is illuminated by a focused pencil ( optics ) the virtual image of the aperture as seen from the world is known as the lens 's entrance pupil ; ideally , all rays of light leaving a point on the object that enter the entrance pupil will be focused to the same point on the image sensor/film ( provided the object point is in the field of view ) in this simple case , the aperture , entrance pupil , and exit pupil are all in the same place because the only optical element is in the plane of the aperture , but in general these three will be in different places image : telephoto.jpg thumb the zoom lens assembly of the canon elph a camera lens may be made from a number of elements : from one , as in the box brownie 's meniscus lens , to over 20 in the more complex zooms a shutter , to regulate the time during which light may pass , may be incorporated within the lens assembly ( for better quality imagery ) , within the camera , or even , rarely , in front of the lens the camera equation , or g , is the ratio of the radiance reaching the camera sensor to the irradiance on the focal plane of the camera lens the maximum usable aperture of a lens is specified as the focal ratio or f-number , defined as the lens 's focal length divided by the effective aperture ( or entrance pupil ) , a dimensionless number practical lens assemblies may also contain mechanisms to deal with measuring light , secondary apertures for flare reduction , and mechanisms to hold the aperture open until the instant of exposure to allow slr cameras to focus with a brighter image with shallower depth of field , theoretically allowing better focus accuracy for a given film or sensor size , specified by the length of the diagonal , a lens may be classified as a : normal lens : angle of view of the diagonal about 50° and a focal length approximately equal to the image diagonal photographs can be taken of a person stretching out a hand with a wideangle , a normal lens , and a telephoto , which contain exactly the same image size by changing the distance from the subject the complexity of a lens — the number of elements and their degree of asphericity — depends upon the angle of view , the maximum aperture , and intended price point , among other variables an extreme wideangle lens of large aperture must be of very complex construction to correct for optical aberrations , which are worse at the edge of the field and when the edge of a large lens is used for image-forming the reflection of light at each of the many interfaces between different optical media ( air , glass , plastic ) seriously degraded the contrast and color saturation of early lenses , particularly zoom lenses , especially where the lens was directly illuminated by a light source the introduction many years ago of optical coatings , and advances in coating technology over the years , have resulted in major improvements , and modern high-quality zoom lenses give images of quite acceptable contrast , although zoom lenses with many elements will transmit less light than lenses made with fewer elements ( all other factors such as aperture , focal length , and coatings being equal ) a few other types do as well , notably the mamiya tlr cameras and slr , medium format cameras ( rz67 , rb67 , 645-1000s ) other companies that produce medium format equipment such as bronica , hasselblad and fuji have similar camera styles that allow interchangeability in the lenses as well , and mirrorless interchangeable-lens cameras the lenses attach to the camera using a lens mount , which contains mechanical linkages and often also electrical contacts between the lens and camera body guy 2012 , page 53 a few older manual focus lens mount designs , such as the leica m39 lens mount for rangefinders , m42 lens mount for early slrs , and the pentax k mount are found across multiple brands , but this is not common today the most common interchangeable lens mounts on the market today include the canon ef , ef-s and ef-m autofocus lens mounts , the nikon f manual and autofocus mounts , the olympus/kodak four thirds and olympus/panasonic micro four thirds digital-only mounts , the pentax k mount and autofocus variants , the sony alpha mount ( derived from the minolta mount ) and the sony e digital-only mount a macro lens used in macro or '' close-up '' photography ( not to be confused with the compositional term close up ) is any lens that produces an image on the focal plane ( i.e a macro lens may be of any focal length , the actual focus length being determined by its practical use , considering magnification , the required ratio , access to the subject , and illumination considerations it can be a special lens corrected optically for close up work or it can be any lens modified ( with adapters or spacers , which are also known as '' extension tubes ''
