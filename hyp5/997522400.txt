technically , in s-vhs et mode , the recording circuit is altered with : change of the w/d clip level ( reducing the white clip level from 210 % in svhs to 190 % in svhs et ) change of the main emphasis characteristics ( changing the frequency responses ) change of the recording level ( y and c ) and recording current jvc video technical guide - video cassette recorder - hr-s9500 ntsc/pal/secam , march 1999 - retrieved from ( members only ) on january 9 , 2016 some public-access television stations and other low-budget cable tv venues used the s-vhs format , both for acquisition and subsequent studio editing , but the network studios largely avoided s-vhs , as descendants of the more expensive betacam format had already become a de facto standard videophiles were the first to theorize that since the only distinguishing feature of an s-vhs tape is a small 3 & nbsp ; mm hole on the underside of the video cassette , it should be possible to use more common and inexpensive vhs tapes by duplicating that hole , for the best recordings and playback , an s-vhs vcr requires s-vhs video tape cassettes nevertheless , it is clear to all that by the time of ed-beta 's introduction , vhs had already won a decisive victory , and no amount of competition on behalf of ed-beta could regain the home video market jvc also introduced an s-vhs et ( super-vhs expansion technology ) system on its s-vhs consumer decks , allowing the use of normal vhs tapes for s-vhs recording , by slightly modifying the s-vhs recording specs while still retaining compatibility so that s-vhs et tapes could be played with non-et s-vhs vcrs for most of these stations , while the u-matics that they had been using were being phased out , but digital video was still years away , s-vhs was used to record from the composite setups that were still in place for u-matic production in the us a number of local access tv stations , and in canada local cable channels used s-vhs in the 1990s to record and playback local programs , such as city councils and christmas parades the largest vcr manufacturers , such as matsushita ( panasonic ) and mitsubishi , gradually moved to dvd recorders , and hard-disk based digital video recorders ( dvrs ) where the s- in s-vhs means '' super '' , the s- in s-video refers to the '' separated '' luminance and chrominance signals s-vhs et is a further modification of the vhs standards that permitted near s-vhs quality recordings on more common and less expensive basic vhs tapes as an added bonus , due to the increased bandwidth of s-vhs , teletext data ( pal ) signals can be recorded along with the normal video signal to get the most benefit from s-vhs , a direct video connection to the monitor or tv is required , ideally via an s-video connectors and/or s-video enabled scart s-vhs video cassettes are sensed and identified by the video cassette recorder via a specific internal profile within a hole in the underside of the s-vhs video cassette body shortly after the announcement of s-vhs , sony responded with an announcement of extended definition betamax ( ed-beta ) however , s-video connectors became common on many other video devices : dvd players and recorders , minidv and hi8 camcorders , cable/satellite set-top boxes , tv-compatible video outputs on computers and video game consoles , and inputs on tv sets themselves in vhs , the chroma carrier is both severely bandlimited and rather noisy , a limitation that s-vhs does not address
