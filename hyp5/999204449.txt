alt unlike many miniature breeds that resemble their larger counterparts , this breed was not developed simply by selective breeding the rough collie for smaller and smaller size the original sheepdog of shetland was a spitz-type dog , probably similar to the modern icelandic sheepdog this dog was crossed with mainland working collies brought to the islands , and then after being brought to england , it was further extensively crossed with the rough collie , and other breeds including some or all of the extinct greenland dog , the king charles spaniel ( not the cavalier ) , the pomeranian , and possibly the border collie when the breed was originally introduced breeders called them shetland collies , which upset rough collie breeders , so the name was changed to shetland sheepdog during the early 20th century ( up until the 1940s ) , additional crosses were made to rough collies to help retain the desired rough collie type â€“ in fact , the first akc sheltie champion 's dam was a purebred rough collie the year 1909 marked the initial recognition of the sheltie by the english kennel club , with the first registered sheltie being a female called badenock rose the first sheltie to be registered by the american kennel club was '' lord scott '' in 1911 the english kennel club describes three different colors : '' tricolor , blue merle , and sable ( ranging from golden through mahogany ) , marked with varying amounts of white and/or tan '' essentially , however , a blue merle dog is a genetically black dog , either black , white , and tan ( tricolor ) merling dilutes the base color ( sable , tricolor , or bi-black ) causing a black dog 's coat to show a mix of black , white , and grey hairs , often with black patches it is hard to tell , without actually breeding , whether a dog is white-factored or not , though dogs with white going up the stifle ( the front of the hind leg ) are usually assumed to be white-factored for show dogs , dogs more than 50 percent white are heavily penalized and thus are not shown in the breed ring ; they are normal in every other way there have been reports of a brindle sheltie but many sheltie enthusiasts agree that a cross sometime in the ancestry of that specific sheltie could have produced a brindle in the us and canada , breed standards state that males and females can be between , all other standards ( australia , new zealand and uk ) specify males : , females : except fci which specifies females : at the shoulder ( withers ) , however , some shelties can be found outside of these ranges but are not considered truly representative of the breed to conform to the breed standards , the shelties ' ears should bend slightly or '' tip '' , this contributes to the '' proper sheltie expression '' if a dog 's ears are not bent ( referred to as prick ears ) some owners brace them into the correct position for several weeks to several months mats can be commonly found behind the ears , under the elbow on each front leg , and in the fluffy fur on the hind legs ( the '' skirts '' ) , as well as around the collar ( if worn ) his research found that an average sheltie could understand a new command in fewer than five repetitions and would obey a command the first time it was given 95 % of the time or better the disease manifests itself as alopecia on the top of the head , supra- and suborbital area and forearms as well as the tip of the tail cea is genetic , inheritance is autosomal recessive , this means that even a dog that shows no phenotypic signs of the condition may be a carrier breeders should actively try to breed this disease out by only breeding with dogs that have '' clear '' eyes or very low scoring eyes currently there is no treatment for either disease , but as both diseases ( cea and pra ) are hereditary it is possible to eliminate them using selective breeding certain colour combinations can produce unwanted or potentially harmful results , such as mating blue merle to blue merle , which can produce what is called a '' double merle '' , more likely to suffer from deafness or blindness a tri-colour to a pure-for-sable ( a sable and white which can produce only other sable and whites ) , will produce only sable and whites , but they will be tri-factored sable and whites ( which means they have the tri-gene there are many different genes contributing to the different colours of the sheltie , including the bi gene , the merling gene , the sable gene , and the tricolour gene according to the college of veterinary medicine at washington state university , the shetland sheepdog , and many other herding breeds , have a risk of being born with a mdr1 gene mutation , with about 15 percent of individuals affected due to this genetic mutation , affected dogs may exhibit sensitivity or adverse reactions to many drugs , including acepromazine , butorphanol , doxorubicin , erythromycin , ivermectin , loperamide , milbemycin , moxidectin , rifampin , selamectin , vinblastine , and vincristine as the name suggests , shelties can and have been used as sheepdogs and still participate in sheepdog trials to this day in their size group , the breed dominates dog agility , obedience , showmanship , flyball , tracking , and herding
