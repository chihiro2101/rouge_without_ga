the 12m , 15m , and 17m models had a stone engine , which in the first 12m was a carryover of the sidevalve ( flathead ) engine from the first taunus series , and beginning with the 15m , it was replaced by an overhead-valve design similar to the british ford consul engine however , a few exceptions from that rule were made , such as 17m 1800 , which was powered by the v6 in its smallest displacement of 90.777 l and the 20m 2300s ( in the later p7 series ) , which used a 2.3-l version of the same engine from 1952 to 1968 , all german fords were called the taunus , using the model names 12m , 15m , 17m , 20m , and 26m ( on some scandinavian markets , for a short while the branding 10m was used on a slightly better-equipped export version of the early taunus , which is said to be the precursor of later uses ) the ford taunus g93a was a development of the ford eifel , and used the same 1172-cc four cylinder engine , but in a longer chassis and a streamlined body the taunus was produced in argentina from 1974 up until the end of 1984 , when the production assembly was sold to turkey to manufacture the otosan taunus this led to the cortina 80 at the end of its production life serving as a starting point for the first hyundai stellar which succeeded the cortina line in south korea , handing over some major technical components such as the steering rack and the transmission propelling shaft to the otherwise non-ford successor between 1970 and 1975 , for the first taunus tc , a fashionable fast-back coupé was also included in the taunus range a couple of different tc2 ford taunus models were driven by barry foster in his portrayal as amsterdam detective van der valk in the original series a 1979 ford taunus is a main feature of the swedish television show byhåla a notable passenger of the taunus was the iconic jaws ( richard kiel ) , who was presumably the only survivor when bond managed to shake off the pursuing car and cause it to overshoot a cliff and plough into the roof of a barn the taunus tc and cortina mk.iii were both developed under the auspices of ford of europe , and most major components including key parts of the bodyshell were identical the new ford taunus p4 was similar in size , but a completely new car based on the ford cardinal project : new body , new v4 engine , front-wheel drive shrinking sales of the p7 forced ford to offer a restyled car only one year later , and the new car was again called p7 the 26m , introduced in 1969 , is the top-of-the-line version with a new bigger engine ( 2.6 litres ) , bigger brakes , dual headlights , power steering , and the most luxurious trim level the taunus and cortina mk iv were in most cases now almost identical , apart from regional variations ( in terms of specification changes and trim levels ) although the 1.7-litre version was launched with the same 60 ps power output as the outgoing model , the new model was a full 10 & nbsp ; km/h ( 6 & nbsp ; mph ) faster , which was attributed to improved aerodynamics and a lighter body shell a blue 1948 model taunus was driven by steve forrest in the very first episode of the 1965 tv series the baron the taunus tc along with the cortina mk iii and their successors have been produced in slightly updated forms in europe , argentina and widely across asia by ford or their local co-operators in 1970 a new taunus , the taunus cortina ( tc ) , was introduced a black 1976 model taunus was driven by henchman chasing james bond ( roger moore ) - in his lotus esprit - in the 1977 film the spy who loved me on the roads of sardinia in 1982 production of the taunus ceased in europe ; it was replaced by the ford sierra this model also formed the basis of the ford cortina , but with different door skins and rear wing pressings from the '' coke-bottle '' styling of the cortina
