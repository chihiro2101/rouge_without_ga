according to krashen , the acquisition of a language is a natural process ; whereas learning a language is a conscious one not all educators in second language agree to this distinction ; however , the study of how a second language is learned/acquired is referred to as second-language acquisition ( sla ) other dominant theories and points of research include 2nd language acquisition studies ( which examine if l1 findings can be transferred to l2 learning ) , verbal behaviour ( the view that constructed linguistic stimuli can create a desired speech response ) , morpheme studies , behaviourism , error analysis , stages and order of acquisition , structuralism ( approach that looks at how the basic units of language relate to each other according to their common characteristics ) , 1st language acquisition studies , contrastive analysis ( approach where languages were examined in terms of differences and similarities ) and inter-language ( which describes l2 learners ’ language as a rule-governed , dynamic system ) ( mitchell , myles , 2004 ) common methods are the grammar-translation method , the direct method , the audio-lingual method ( clearly influenced by audio-lingual research and the behaviourist approach ) , the silent way , suggestopedia , community language learning , the total physical response method , and the communicative approach ( highly influenced by krashen ’ s theories ) ( doggett , 1994 ) the defining difference between a first language ( l1 ) and a second language ( l2 ) is the age the person learned the language later , hyltenstam & abrahamsson ( 2003 ) modified their age cut-offs to argue that after childhood , in general , it becomes more and more difficult to acquire native-like-ness , but that there is no cut-off point in particular as we are learning more and more about the brain , there is a hypothesis that when a child is going through puberty , that is the time that accents start whereas after puberty , the ability for learning a language without an accent has been rerouted to function in another area of the brain—most likely in the frontal lobe area promoting cognitive functions , or in the neural system of hormone allocated for reproduction and sexual organ growth as far as the relationship between age and eventual attainment in sla is concerned , krashen , long , and scarcella , say that people who encounter foreign language in early age , begin natural exposure to second languages and obtain better proficiency than those who learn the second language as an adult however , when it comes to the relationship between age and rate sla , “ adults proceed through early stages of syntactic and morphological development faster than children ( where time and exposure are held constant ) ” ( krashen , long , scarcella 573 ) gauthier and genesee ( 2011 ) have done a research which mainly focuses on the second language acquisition of internationally adopted children and results show that early experiences of one language of children can affect their ability to acquire a second language , and usually children learn their second language slower and weaker even during the critical period as for the fluency , it is better to do foreign language education at an early age , but being exposed to a foreign language since an early age causes a “ weak identification ” ( billiet , maddens and beerten 241 ) and as children learn more and more foreign languages , children start to adapt , and get absorbed into the foreign culture that they “ undertake to describe themselves in ways that engage with representations others have made ” ( pratt 35 ) however , children by around the age of 5 have more or less mastered their first language with the exception of vocabulary and a few grammar structures , and the process is relatively very fast because language is a very complex skill moreover , if children start to learn a second language when they are 7 years old or younger , they will also be fully fluent with their second language in a faster speed comparing to the speed of learning by adults who start to learn a second language later in their life in the 1970s dulay and burt ’ s studies showed that learners acquire grammar forms and structures in a pre-determined , inalterable order , and that teaching or correcting styles would not change this ( russell , 2009 ) in this same decade terrell ( 1977 ) did studies that showed that there were more factors to be considered in the classroom than the cognitive processing of the students ( russell , 2009 ) in 1998 , lyster concluded that “ recasts ” ( when the teacher repeats a student ’ s incorrect utterance with the correct version ) are not always the most useful because students do not notice the correction ( russell , 2009 ) so learners in both their native and second language have knowledge that goes beyond what they have received , so that people can make correct utterances ( phrases , sentences , questions , etc ) that they have never learned or heard before the first is nativeness which means the speaker 's ability to approximately reach the speaking pattern of the second language of speakers ; and the second , understanding , refers to the speaker 's ability to make themselves understood
