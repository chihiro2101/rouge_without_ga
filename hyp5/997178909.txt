the understanding of the concept of second messengers , and in particular the role of cyclic nucleotides and their ability to relay physiological signals to a cell , has its origins in the research of glycogen metabolism by carl and gerty cori , for which they were awarded a nobel prize in physiology or medicine in 1947 the “ active factor ” that the hormones produced was finally purified in 1958 , and then identified as containing a ribose , a phosphate , and an adenine in equal ratios wei-jen tang and james hurley reported in 1998 that adenylyl cyclase , which synthesizes camp , is regulated not only by hormones and neurotransmitters , but also by phosphorylation , calcium , forskolin , and guanine nucleotide-binding proteins ( g proteins ) the cyclic portion refers to the two single bonds between the phosphate group and the ribose the two most well-studied cyclic nucleotides are cyclic amp ( camp ) and cyclic gmp ( cgmp ) , while cyclic cmp ( ccmp ) and cyclic ump ( cump ) are less understood camp is 3 ’ 5 ’ -cyclic adenosine monophosphate , cgmp is 3 ’ 5 ’ -cyclic guanosine monophosphate , ccmp is cytidine 3',5'-monophosphate , and cump is uridine 2',3'-cyclic phosphate a double-ring purine is the nitrogenous base for camp and cgmp , while cytosine , thymine , and uracil each have a single-ring nitrogenous base ( pyrimidine ) these three components are connected so that the nitrogenous base is attached to the first carbon of ribose ( 1 ’ carbon ) , and the phosphate group is attached to the 5 ’ carbon of ribose while all nucleotides have this structure , the phosphate group makes a second connection to the ribose ring at the 3 ’ carbon in cyclic nucleotides when a pentose is connected to a nitrogenous base , carbon atom numbering is distinguished with a prime ( ' ) notation , which differentiates these carbons from the atom numbering of the nitrogenous base therefore , for camp , 3 ’ 5 ’ -cyclic adenosine monophosphate indicates that a single phosphate group forms a cyclic structure with the ribose group at its 3 ’ and 5 ’ carbons , while the ribose group is also attached to adenosine ( this bond is understood to be at the 1 ’ position of the ribose ) cellular concentrations of cyclic nucleotides can be very low , in the 10 −7 m range , because metabolism and function are often localized in particular parts of the cell there is also data to support a synergistic binding effect amongst multiple cyclic nucleotides , with ccmp lowering the effective concentration ( ec 50 ) of camp for activation of protein kinase a ( pka ) in addition , they potentially activate cyclic cng channels in : pineal gland light sensitivity , sensory neurons of the vomeronasal organ ( which is involved in the detection of pheromones ) , taste receptor cells , cell signaling in sperm , airway epithelium cells , gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( gnrh ) -secreting neuronal cell line , and renal collecting duct system examples of disruptions of cnmp pathways include : mutations in cng channel genes are associated with degeneration of the retina and with color blindness ; and overexpression of cytosolic or soluble adenylyl cyclase ( sac ) has been linked to human prostate cancer
