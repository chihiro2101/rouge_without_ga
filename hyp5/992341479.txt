when a nuclear chain reaction in a mass of fissile material is self-sustaining , the mass is said to be in a critical state in which there is no increase or decrease in power , temperature , or neutron population a subcritical mass is a mass of fissile material that does not have the ability to sustain a fission chain reaction if the size of the reactor core is less than a certain minimum , too many fission neutrons escape through its surface and the chain reaction is not sustained because of this , a reasonably sized gun-type weapon would suffer nuclear reaction ( predetonation ) before the masses of plutonium would be in a position for a full-fledged explosion to occur this is fortunate for atomic power generation , for without this delay '' going critical '' would be an immediately catastrophic event , as it is in a nuclear bomb where upwards of 80 generations of chain reaction occur in less than a microsecond , far too fast for a human , or even a machine , to react the critical size is the minimum size of a nuclear reactor core or nuclear weapon that can be made for a specific geometrical arrangement and material composition this is applied in implosion-type nuclear weapons where a spherical mass of fissile material that is substantially less than a critical mass is made supercritical by very rapidly increasing ρ ( and thus σ as well ) ( see below ) when k 1 , the mass is critical , and the chain reaction is self-sustaining in a bomb , a dense shell of material surrounding the fissile core will contain , via inertia , the expanding fissioning material detonation is produced by exploding a shaped charge surrounding the sphere , increasing the density ( and collapsing the cavity , if present ) to produce a prompt critical configuration serber , robert , the los alamos primer : the first lectures on how to build an atomic bomb , ( university of california press , 1992 ) original 1943 '' la-1 '' , declassified in 1965 , plus commentary and historical introduction also , if the tamper is ( e.g if the perfect quantity of fuel were added to a slightly subcritical mass , to create a barely supercritical mass , the temperature of the assembly would increase to an initial maximum ( for example : 1 & nbsp ; k above the ambient temperature ) and then decrease back to the ambient temperature after a period of time , because fuel consumed during fission brings the assembly back to subcriticality once again the event of fission must release , on the average , more than one free neutron of the desired energy level in order to sustain a chain reaction , and each must find other nuclei and cause them to fission nuclear power plants operate between these two points of reactivity , while above the prompt critical point is the domain of nuclear weapons and some nuclear power accidents , such as the chernobyl disaster the mass where criticality occurs may be changed by modifying certain attributes such as fuel , shape , temperature , density and the installation of a neutron-reflective substance for example , a spherical critical mass of pure uranium-235 ( 235 u ) with a mass of about would experience around 15 & nbsp ; spontaneous fission events per second a numerical measure of a critical mass is dependent on the effective neutron multiplication factor , the average number of neutrons released per fission event that go on to cause another fission event rather than being absorbed or leaving the material changing the temperature may also change the density ; however , the effect on critical mass is then complicated by temperature effects ( see '' changing the temperature '' ) and by whether the material expands or contracts with increased temperature because a bomb relies on fast neutrons ( not ones moderated by reflection with light elements , as in a reactor ) , the neutrons reflected by a tamper are slowed by their collisions with the tamper nuclei , and because it takes time for the reflected neutrons to return to the fissile core , they take rather longer to be absorbed by a fissile nucleus the probability that one such event will cause a chain reaction depends on how much the mass exceeds the critical mass the density of a material at a constant temperature can be changed by varying the pressure or tension or by changing crystal structure ( see allotropes of plutonium ) the shape with minimal critical mass and the smallest physical dimensions is a sphere
