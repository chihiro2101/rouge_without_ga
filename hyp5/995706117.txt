like other groups , the members of this family show similar patterns in electron configuration , especially in the outermost shells , resulting in trends in chemical behavior this group has the defining characteristic that all the component elements have 5 electrons in their outermost shell , that is 2 electrons in the s & nbsp ; subshell and 3 unpaired electrons in the p & nbsp ; subshell the most important elements of this group are nitrogen ( n ) , which in its diatomic form is the principal component of air , and phosphorus ( p ) , which , like nitrogen , is essential to all known forms of life these are in the form of re a m b pn c , where m is a carbon group or boron group element and pn is any pnictogen except nitrogen this is the property of these elements which leads to their potential toxicity , most evident in phosphorus , arsenic and antimony paradoxically , it is this strong bonding which causes nitrogen and bismuth 's reduced toxicity ( when in molecules ) , as these form strong bonds with other atoms which are difficult to split , creating very unreactive molecules for example , n 2 , the diatomic form of nitrogen , is used as an inert gas in situations where using argon or another noble gas would be too expensive because 5 & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 3 , it leaves unused two electrons in a lone pair unless there is a positive charge around ( like in ) the light pnictogens ( nitrogen , phosphorus , and arsenic ) tend to form −3 charges when reduced , completing their octet when oxidized or ionized , pnictogens typically take an oxidation state of +3 ( by losing all three p-shell electrons in the valence shell ) or +5 ( by losing all three p-shell and both s-shell electrons in the valence shell ) going down the group , to phosphane ( phosphine ) , arsane ( arsine ) , stibane ( stibine ) , and finally bismuthane ( bismuthine ) , each pnictogen hydride becomes progressively less stable/more unstable , more toxic , and has a smaller hydrogen-hydrogen angle ( from 107.8° in ammonia to 90.48° in bismuthane ) ( also , technically , only ammonia and phosphane have the pnictogen in the −3 oxidation state because , for the rest , the pnictogen is less electronegative than hydrogen nitrogen trifluoride is the only stable nitrogen trihalide , with nitrogen trichloride , nitrogen tribromide and nitrogen triiodide being explosive—nitrogen triiodide being so shock-sensitive that the touch of a feather detonates it arsenic forms +iii compounds with oxygen as arsenites , arsenous acid , and arsenic ( iii ) oxide , and it forms all four trihalides for nitrogen , the +5 state is typically serves as only a formal explanation of molecules like dinitrogen pentoxide , as the high electronegativity of nitrogen causes the electrons to be shared almost evenly the '' true '' +5 state is more common for the essentially non-relativistic typical pnictogens phosphorus , arsenic , and antimony , as shown in their oxides , phosphorus ( v ) oxide , arsenic ( v ) oxide , and antimony ( v ) oxide , and their fluorides , phosphorus ( v ) fluoride , arsenic ( v ) fluoride , antimony ( v ) fluoride pentamethylpnictogen ( v ) compounds exist for arsenic , antimony , and bismuth however , for bismuth , the +5 oxidation state becomes rare due to the relativistic stabilization of the 6s orbitals known as the inert pair effect , so that the 6s electrons are reluctant to bond chemically this causes bismuth ( v ) oxide to be unstable and bismuth ( v ) fluoride to be more reactive than the other pnictogen pentafluorides , making it an extremely powerful fluorinating agent nitrogen forms nitrogen oxide in which the nitrogen can take on a variety of oxidation states , including +ii , +iv , and even some mixed-valence compounds and very unstable +vi oxidation state likewise , diimide , which has two nitrogen atoms double-bonded to each other , and diazene have nitrogen in the oxidation state of −1 a corresponding compound for antimony is sb 2 ( c 6 h 5 ) 4 , where the antimony 's oxidation state is +ii antimony tetroxide is a mixed-valence compound , where half of the antimony atoms are in the +3 oxidation state , and the other half are in the +5 oxidation state it is expected that moscovium will have an inert pair effect for both the 7s and the 7p 1/2 electrons , as the binding energy of the lone 7p 3/2 electron is noticeably lower than that of the 7p 1/2 electrons this is predicted to cause +i to be a common oxidation state for moscovium , although it also occurs to a lesser extent for bismuth and nitrogen phosphorus 's density is 1.82 g/cm 3 at stp , arsenic 's is 5.72 g/cm 3 , antimony 's is 6.68 g/cm 3 , and bismuth 's is 9.79 g/cm 3 arsenic is one of only two elements to sublimate at standard pressure ; it does this at 603 & nbsp ; °c arsenic compounds have been known for at least 5000 years , and the ancient greek theophrastus recognized the arsenic minerals called realgar and orpiment the term '' pnictogen '' ( or '' pnigogen '' ) is derived from the ancient greek word meaning '' to choke '' , referring to the choking or stifling property of nitrogen gas the term '' pnicogen '' is rarer than the term '' pnictogen '' , and the ratio of academic research papers using '' pnictogen '' to those using '' pnicogen '' is 2.5 to 1 it comes from the greek root ( choke , strangle ) , and thus the word '' pnictogen '' is also a reference to the dutch and german names for nitrogen and , respectively , '' suffocating substance '' : i.e the name pentels ( from greek , , five ) also at one time stood for this group nitrogen makes up 25 parts per million of the earth 's crust , 5 parts per million of soil on average , 100 to 500 parts per trillion of seawater , and 78 % of dry air if the ore contains 45 % to 60 % antimony by weight , antimony is obtained by heating the ore , also known as liquidation bismuth minerals do occur , in particular in the form of sulfides and oxides , but it is more economic to produce bismuth as a by-product of the smelting of lead ores or , as in china , of tungsten and zinc ores phosphorus in the form of phosphates occur in compounds important to life , such as dna and atp the build-up of nitrogen bubbles in the blood , such as those that may occur during scuba diving , can cause a condition known as the '' bends '' ( decompression sickness ) the lethal dose of arsenic for a typical adult is 200 mg and can cause diarrhea , vomiting , colic , dehydration , and coma
