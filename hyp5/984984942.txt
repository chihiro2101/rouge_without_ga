the characteristics of an anilox roll determine the amount of ink that will be transferred to the plate : angle of the cells , cell volume , and line screen depending on the design of the printing press , the anilox roll is either semi-submerged in the ink fountain , or comes into contact with a so-called metering roller , which is semi-submerged in the ink fountain anilox rollers that are used with water , solvent and oil based inks , which dry when left sitting out and unagitated , must be cleaned immediately after use or a problem known as plugging occurs , where minuscule amounts of ink dry in the cells a doctor blade is used to shave excess ink from the surface leaving just the measured amount of ink in the cells the roll then rotates to make contact with the flexographic printing plate which receives the ink from the cells for transfer to the printed material there are many variables to consider when specifying an anilox roll beyond the print requirements , such as substrate , ink system , plate material , plate mounting tape , press speed , and drying capacity this is because depending on the pattern used for the cell and depth of gravure of the anilox roll , the cell might contain higher or lower volumes of ink contemporary ink metering systems employ a self contained system known as a chambered doctor blade system which is basically a manifold which delivers ink to the anilox roll the only way to convert cm³/m² ( transfer volume ) to lpcm ( cell finesse ) or bcm to lpi is to look at the conversion chart provided by the anilox roll supplier depending on the detail of the images to be printed , the press operator will select an anilox roll with a higher or lower line screen extreme caution must be taken when handling these pieces of hardware as a single bump against a hard surface or sharp corner can destroy the delicate cell structure on the surface and render a roller completely useless , at a cost of around 5000 for even small narrow-web rollers print results are accomplished with this volume , which transfers to the printing plate and then to the substrate the other reverse angle blade works as previously described , removing excess ink from the engraved surface of the anilox roll
