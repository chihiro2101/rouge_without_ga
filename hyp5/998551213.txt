concomitant esotropia – that is , an inward squint that does not vary with the direction of gaze – mostly sets in before 12 months of age ( this constitutes 40 % of all strabismus cases ) or at the age of three or four the person with hyperopia , in an attempt to '' accommodate '' or focus the eyes , converges the eyes as well , as convergence is associated with activation of the accommodation reflex where the degree of hyperopia is large , the child may not be able to produce clear vision no matter how much extra-accommodation is exerted and thus no incentive exists for the over-accommodation and convergence that can give rise to the onset of esotropia however , where the degree of error is small enough to allow the child to generate clear vision by over-accommodation , but large enough to disrupt their binocular control , esotropia will result where the esotropia is solely a consequence of uncorrected hyperopic refractive error , providing the child with the correct glasses and ensuring that these are worn all the time , is often enough to control the deviation it is , however , associated with other ocular dysfunctions including oblique muscle over-actions , dissociated vertical deviation ( dvd ) , manifest latent nystagmus , and defective abduction , which develops as a consequence of the tendency of those with infantile esotropia to 'cross fixate ' cross fixation involves the use of the right eye to look to the left and the left eye to look to the right ; a visual pattern that will be 'natural ' for the person with the large angle esotropia whose eye is already deviated towards the opposing side ' in an alternating esotropia , the patient is able to alternate fixation between their right and left eye so that at one moment the right eye fixates and the left eye turns inward , and at the next the left eye fixates and the right turns inward it is possible to encourage alternation through the use of occlusion or patching of the 'dominant ' or 'fixating ' eye to promote the use of the other esotropias can be concomitant , where the size of the deviation does not vary with direction of gaze—or incomitant , where the direction of gaze does affect the size , or indeed presence , of the esotropia concomitant esotropias can arise as an initial problem , in which case they are designated as '' primary , '' as a consequence of loss or impairment of vision , in which case they are designated as '' secondary , '' or following overcorrection of an initial exotropia in which case they are described as being '' consecutive '' in specific cases , and primarily in adult patients , botulinum toxin can be used either as a permanent therapeutic approach , or as a temporary measure to prevent contracture of muscles prior to surgery where necessary , extra-ocular muscle surgery , like strabismus surgery , which is a surgery where the doctors physically move the muscle that is making the eye contract the term '' esotropia '' is ultimately derived from the ancient greek ἔσω ésō , meaning “ within ” , and τρόπος trópos , meaning “ a turn ” .
