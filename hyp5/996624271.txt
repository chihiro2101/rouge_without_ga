in star raiders , this part of the game takes the form of a '' galactic chart '' display dividing the game 's large-scale world into a grid of sectors , some of which are empty , while other are occupied by enemy ships or a friendly '' starbase '' flying about in the 3d view with the ship 's normal engines is sufficient for travel within a sector ; travel between sectors is via '' hyperspace '' , accomplished through an elaborate and noisy '' hyperwarp '' sequence with graphics loosely reminiscent of the star wars and star trek films in which the stars seemed to stretch to radial lines in the main first-person display , the player can look out of the ship and shoot '' photons '' at zylon ships , which come in three different varieties reminiscent of ships from star wars , star trek , and battlestar galactica ( whose villains were the similarly titled cylons ) a small targeting display in the lower right corner gives a general indication of a distant enemy or starbase 's position relative to the player 's ship , and also indicates when weapons are locked on the enemy , at which point the player 's weapons will fire two torpedoes simultaneously however , there is no running score display ; only upon winning , dying or quitting the game will the player receive a '' rating '' , which is a quasi-military rank accompanied by a numerical class with particularly bad play earning a rank of '' garbage scow captain '' or '' galactic cook '' the rating depends on a formula involving the game play level , energy and time used , star bases destroyed ( both by player or the enemy ) , the number of enemies destroyed , and whether the player succeeded in destroying all enemies , was destroyed , or aborted ( quit or ran out of energy ) the mission star raiders was unusual at the time for atari , as it made relatively few game cartridges for its computers , with most being adaptations of atari 2600 titles the atari 's use of an indirect palette means that color changes associated with the presence or absence of energy shields , emergency alarms , and the screen flash representing destruction of the ship can be accomplished by simply changing the palette values in memory registers the entire game , code and data , fits into 8k ( 8192 bytes ) of rom , and requires only 8k of ram for its working data and display visuals ; thus it can run on any atari 8-bit computer this version is nearly identical to the computer version , but takes advantage of the 5200 's analog joystick by allowing for variable speed turning , and puts all the game functions in the player 's hand via the controller 's 12-button keypad other changes are graphical improvements to the sector scan mode by displaying small images of enemy ships and objects instead of pinpoints , alterations to some of the text responses to be more specific to the game-ending action , and automatically switching to forward view when hyperspace is engaged it is a very different game in many ways , with more enemy ship types , different weapons , slower action , and a map featuring a triangular grid instead of a square one , which makes it much easier for the zylon ships to surround starbases while criticizing the violent gameplay , after seeing a demonstration ted nelson wrote , '' the atari machine is the most extraordinary computer graphics box ever made , and star raiders is its virtuoso demonstration game '' compute ! in 1980 wrote that star raiders is '' incredibly exciting to play and just about as much fun to watch !
