the hypernym '' smell '' ( to emit any smell ) has a hyponym '' stink '' ( to emit a bad smell ) , but is autohyponymous because '' smell '' can also mean '' to emit a bad smell '' , even though there is no '' to emit a smell that is n't bad '' hyponym yankee is autohyponymous because it is a hyponym ( native of new england ) and its hypernym ( native of the united states ) , even though there is no other hyponym of yankee ( as native of the united states ) that means '' not a native of new england '' for example , the word dog describes both the species canis familiaris and male individuals of canis familiaris , so it is possible to say '' that dog is n't a dog , it 's a bitch '' ( '' that hypernym z is n't a hyponym z , it 's a hyponym y '' ) a word can be both a hypernym and a hyponym : for example purple is a hyponym of color but itself is a hypernym of the broad spectrum of shades of purple between the range of crimson and violet for example , screwdriver , scissors , knife , and hammer are all co-hyponyms of one another and hyponyms of tool , but not hyponyms of one another : '' a hammer is a type of knife '' is false hyponymy is a transitive relation , if x is a hyponym of y , and y is a hyponym of z , then x is a hyponym of z it consists of two relations ; the first one being exemplified in '' an x is a y '' ( simple hyponymy ) while the second relation is '' an x is a kind/type of y '' for example , fingers describe all digits on a hand , but the existence of the word thumb for the first finger means that fingers can also be used for '' non-thumb digits on a hand '' for example , '' a screwdriver is a kind of tool '' makes sense , but not '' a tool is a kind of screwdriver '' for example , violet is a hyponym of purple and purple is a hyponym of color ; therefore violet is a hyponym of color strictly speaking , the meaning relation between hyponyms and hypernyms applies to lexical items of the same word class ( or parts of speech ) , and holds between senses rather than words linguist ruth kempson had already observed that if there are hyponyms for one part of a set but not another , the hypernym can complement the existing hyponym by being used for the remaining part
