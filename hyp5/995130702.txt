during the tenth century , viking dublin developed into the kingdom of dublin—a thriving town and a large area of the surrounding countryside , whose rulers controlled extensive territories in the irish sea and , at one time , york dublin was closely involved in the affairs of the kingdom of the isles , which included the isle of man and the hebrides , and when the dublin king amlaíb cuarán was defeated by máel sechnaill mac domnaill at the battle of tara in 980 , he was supported by the men of the isles amlaíb 's son , sigtrygg silkbeard , who was king of dublin from 990 , allied himself with his uncle máel mórda mac murchada , king of laigin from the time of the seventh century and the reign of domnall mac áedo , the kingship of tara was a title which was strongly associated with the high king of ireland and was held by members of the uí néill dynasty , who controlled the northern half of ireland he marched on tara in 1000 with the combined armies of munster , osraige , leinster , and dublin , but after an advance party consisting of the latter two groups was destroyed by máel sechnaill , brian boru withdrew from the area without giving battle brian consolidated his hold on ireland by eventually obtaining the submission of the northern territories of cenél neógain , cenél conaill , and ulaid , following a series of circuits of the northern part of the island he completed the task when , following '' a great hosting.by land and sea '' into the uí néill territory of cenél conaill in 1011 , the king was brought south to dál gcais territory to submit to brian boru in person at his royal site of cenn corad 89 sigtrygg went overseas in search of viking support and enlisted the help of sigurd the stout , the earl of orkney and brodir , a warrior of the isle of man brian mustered the army of munster , which was joined by máel sechnaill and two connacht kings , mael ruanaidh ua heidhin , king of uí fiachrach aidhne , and tadhg ua cellaigh , king of uí maine , and they marched on dublin among the fallen on brian 's side , they name the high king himself , his son murchad , and his grandson toirdelbach , as well as his nephew conaing , domnall mac diarmata of corcu baiscind ( county clare ) , mac bethad mac muiredaig of ciarraige luachra ( county kerry ) , mael ruanaidh ua heidhin of uí fiachrach aidhne , and tadhg ua cellaigh of uí maine ( both in south connacht ) 179–80 on the opposing side are named máel morda , dubgall mac amlaíb ( brother of sigtrygg ) , gilla ciaráin mac glún iairn ( probably a nephew of sigtrygg ) , sigurd hlodvirsson of orkney , and brodir , commander of the viking fleet but the annals of ulster say that máel sechnaill and brian rode together to dublin , and the annals of the four masters go so far as to say that it was máel sechnaill who won the day , and completed the rout after the death of brian 185 , 191 on the other hand , cogad gáedel re gallaib ( '' the war of the irish with the foreigners '' ) , says that the men of meath came to the muster with brian , but '' were not faithful to him '' 201 according to the cogad , after his arrival at dublin , brian sent his forces north across the river to plunder the area known as fine gall , and they torched the country as far as howth the front line of the dublin-leinster forces were the foreign vikings , led by brodir , sigurd , and a man called plait , described as '' the bravest knight of all the foreigners '' 211–13 at the front of brian 's forces were the dál gcais , led by brian 's son murchad , murchad 's fifteen-year-old son toirdelbach , brian 's brother cudulligh , and domnall mac diarmata of corcu baiscind the two men marched out into the middle of the field and fought , and both died , '' with the sword of each through the heart of the other , and the hair of each in the clenched hand of the other 209–10 brian 's son murchad , at the head of the dál gcais army , took on the foreign vikings and , according to the cogad , he himself killed 100 of the enemy—fifty with the sword in his right hand and fifty with the sword in his left there it was met by the coarb of patrick , the traditional head of the church in ireland , who brought the body back with him to armagh , where it was interred after twelve days of mourning 111 though the annals imply that life was not much changed after the death of brian boru , it created a succession crisis , as brian 's son and heir murchad had died as well in 1052 , diarmait mac máel na mbó , king of leinster , captured dublin and fine gall , for the first time asserting irish overlordship over the norse of ireland the standard view , and the '' popular '' view , is that the battle ended a war between the irish and vikings by which brian boru broke viking power in ireland however revisionist historians see it as an irish civil war in which brian boru 's munster and its allies defeated leinster and dublin , and that there were vikings fighting on both sides in january 2018 researchers from the universities of coventry , oxford and sheffield , led by coventry university theoretical physicist professor ralph kenna , published a paper in the journal royal society open science , that used network science to mathematically analyse a medieval text , cogadh gáedhel re gallaibh ( the war of the gaedhil with the gaill , meaning invasions of ireland by the danes and other norsemen ) , that listed over 1000 relationships between about 300 characters , and concluded that the standard and popular view was broadly correct , but that the picture was nevertheless more complex than '' a fully 'clear-cut ' irish versus viking conflict ''
