it rests on three basic conceptions of space : an isovist ( popularised by michael benedikt at university of texas ) , or viewshed or visibility polygon , the field of view from any particular point axial space ( idea popularized by bill hillier at ucl ) , a straight sight-line and possible path convex space ( popularized by john peponis , and his collaborators at georgia tech ) , an occupiable void where , if imagined as a wireframe diagram , no line between two of its points goes outside its perimeter : all points within the polygon are visible to all other points within the polygon theoretically , the integration measure shows the cognitive complexity of reaching a street , and is often argued to 'predict ' the pedestrian use of a street : the easier it is to reach a street , the more popular it should be space syntax originated as a programme research in the early 1970s when bill hillier , adrian leaman and alan beattie came together at the school of environmental studies at university college london ( now part of the bartlett school of architecture ) one of the first cohort of students on the mscaas was julienne hanson who went on to co-author the social logic of space ( sls ) with bill hillier ( cup , 1984 ) sls also developed an analytic approach to representation and quantification of spatial configuration at the building and the settlement scale , making possible both comparative studies as well as analysis of the relationship between spatial configuration and aspect of social function in the built environment space syntax has grown to become a tool used around the world in a variety of research areas and design applications in architecture , urban design , urban planning , transport and interior design many prominent design applications have been made by the architectural and urban planning practice space syntax limited , which was founded at the bartlett , university college london in 1989 over the past decade , space syntax techniques have been used for research in archaeology , information technology , urban and human geography , and anthropology recently there has also been research development that combines space syntax with geographic accessibility analysis in gis , such as the place syntax-models developed by the research group spatial analysis and design at the royal institute of technology in stockholm , sweden a series of interdisciplinary works published from 2006 by vito latora , sergio porta and colleagues , proposing a network approach to street centrality analysis and design , have highlighted space syntax ' contribution to decades of previous studies in the physics of spatial complex networks .
