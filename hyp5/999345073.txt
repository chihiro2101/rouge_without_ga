the original rationale behind their design was that they were intended to operate as adjuncts to the main battle fleet , based on standard-type battleships since world war i they were to scout out ahead of the fleet and report on the enemy fleet 's composition , speed , and course , then they were to attack and whittle down the enemy in preparation for the main fleet action , a titanic gun battle between battleships and cruisers navy experimented constantly with this concept in the post-world war i years , producing a series of submarines with less than stellar qualities and reliability , the ( also known as the t class ) and the v-boats , of which v-1 through v-3 were an unsuccessful attempt to produce a fleet submarine by 1931 , the experimental phase of fleet submarine development was over and the navy began to make solid progress towards what would eventually be the gato class by 1940 , a much better developed industrial base and experience gained from the porpoise- , - , and boats resulted in the tambor-class submarine fortunately , the same capabilities that would have enabled these submarines to operate with the fleet made them superbly qualified for their new mission of commerce raiding against the japanese empire the only significant differences were an increase in diving depth from to , and an extra five feet in length to allow the addition of a watertight bulkhead dividing the one large engine room in two , with two diesel generators in each room operational experience with earlier boats led the naval architects and engineers at the navy 's bureau of construction and repair to believe that they had been unduly conservative in their estimates of hull strength without changing the construction or thickness of the pressure hull steel , they decided that the gato-class boats would be fully capable of routinely operating at 300 feet , a increase in test depth over the preceding classes the gatos were slow divers when compared to some german and british designs , but that was mostly because the gatos were significantly larger boats acknowledging this limitation , the bureau designers incorporated a negative ( sometimes called a '' down express '' ) tank into the design , which was flooded to provide a large amount of negative buoyancy at the start of the dive the class of boats had numerous crew comforts including air conditioning , refrigerated storage for food , generous evaporator ( marine ) s , clothes washers , and bunks for nearly every crew member ; these were luxuries virtually unheard of in other navies the bureau designers felt that if a crew of 60–80 men were to be expected to conduct 75-day patrols in the warm waters of the pacific , these types of features were vital to the health and efficiency of the crew at the beginning of the war , gato-class boats , as well as the gar and tambor classes , had fully shrouded fairwaters visually similar to modern nuclear submarines submarines lost in world war ii were of this class , plus , a damaged boat that returned to the u.s ″united states submarine losses world war ii″ , naval history division , office of the chief of naval operations , washington : 1963 ( fifth printing ) occasionally , some confusion arises as to the number of gato-class submarines built , with some sources listing the total as 73 , due to the transitional nature of the first four boats ( ss-361 through ss-364 ) constructed under the second contract by the manitowoc shipbuilding company of manitowoc , wisconsin these were originally intended to be balao-class subs and were assigned hull numbers that fall in the middle of the range of numbers for the balao class ( ss-285 to ss-416 , ss-425 , and s-426 ) due to their large construction capacity , more than half ( 41 ) of the class was built at electric boat facilities ; three new slipways were added to the north yard and four slipways were added to the south yard to accommodate their production however , in the summer of 1942 , six new gatos were assigned to submarine squadron 50 and sent to rosneath , scotland , to patrol the bay of biscay and to assist in the operation torch landings in north africa once they began to arrive in theater in large numbers in mid-to-late 1942 , the gatos were in the thick of the fight against the japanese , flasher , and were third , fourth , and seventh place on the list for the number of ships sunk gato-class boats sank four japanese submarines : , , , and ;
