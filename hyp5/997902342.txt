printing the finished plate is the same for either method , and follows the normal way for an intaglio plate ; the whole surface is inked , the ink is then wiped off the surface to leave ink only in the pits of the still rough areas below the original surface of the plate mezzotint is known for the luxurious quality of its tones : first , because an evenly , finely roughened surface holds a lot of ink , allowing deep solid colors to be printed ; secondly because the process of smoothing the plate with burin , burnisher and scraper allows fine gradations in tone to be developed metropolitan museum of art : the printed image in the west : mezzotint mezzotint with guy langevin youtube national portrait gallery , london : the early history of mezzotint and the prints of richard tompson and alexander browne prints & people : a social history of printed pictures , an exhibition catalog from the metropolitan museum of art ( fully available online as pdf ) , which contains material on mezzotint mezzotint and other similar printmaking techniques the method commonly in use today is to use a steel rocker approximately five inches wide , which has between 45 and 120 teeth per inch on the face of a blade in the shape of a shallow arc , with a wooden handle projecting upwards in a t-shape the main area of collecting was british portraits ; hit oil paintings from the royal academy summer exhibition were routinely , and profitably , reproduced in mezzotint throughout this period , and other mezzotinters reproduced older portraits of historical figures , or if necessary , made them up the rocker seems to have been invented by prince rupert of the rhine , a famous cavalry commander in the english civil war , who was the next to use the process , and took it to england there were two basic styles of collection : some concentrated on making a complete collection of material within a certain scope , while others aimed at perfect condition and quality ( which declines in mezzotints after a relatively small number of impressions are taken from a plate ) , and in collecting the many '' proof states '' which artists and printers had obligingly provided for them from early on because the pits in the plate are not deep , only a small number of top-quality impressions ( copies ) can be printed before the quality of the tone starts to degrade as the pressure of the press begins to smooth them out this method was referred to as the ‘ additive method ’ ; that is , adding areas of indentations to the plate for the areas of the print that were to appear darker in tone this technique meant that is was possible to create the image directly by only roughening a blank plate selectively , where the darker parts of the image are to be the image is then created by selectively burnishing areas of the surface of the metal plate with metal tools ; the smoothed parts will print lighter than those areas not smoothed by the burnishing tool
