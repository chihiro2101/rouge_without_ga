michael penman , robert the bruce , king of the scots his date of birth is unknown , but it was probably not very long after robert was born in 1274 ; he was old enough to be fighting in 1307 and to be given an independent command not long after the irish medievalist seán duffy suggests that he was probably fostered in ireland as a child , likely by the o'neills of ulster , while archie duncan suggests some period of time spent with the bissetts of the glens of antrim traquair , peter freedom 's sword some time between 1309 and 1313 , edward was created earl of carrick , a title previously held by his maternal grandfather niall of carrick , his mother and his elder brother in 1258 some of the dynasties and clans elected brian ua neill to this position ; however he was defeated and killed by the normans at the battle of down in 1260 he , along with his brothers , was also descended from lords of galloway , who were themselves a branch of the same kings of mann and the isles which produced somerled , progenitor of clan donald , clan dougall , and clan ruari this became critical when the isle of man was recaptured by english-backed scots from king robert 's control in january 1315 , thereby threatening the south and south-west of scotland and also reopening up a potential source of aid to the english from the anglo-irish and native irish ó néill had been troubled by anglo-irish incursions to the south-east ( the de verdons ) , the east ( tenants of the earl of ulster ) and west ( also by the earl of ulster ) of tír eógain and in order to retain his lands , he and some twelve of his vassals and allies jointly asked for aid from scotland the bruce brothers agreed , on condition that they would support edward as king of ireland , as the brothers envisaged themselves as separate rulers of scotland and ireland , while robert would regain man and edward possibly making an attack on wales , with welsh support at about this point , roger mortimer , 1st earl of march , received news from irish sources that an invasion was about to take place , and made his way to ireland where he held land , mainly in and around the castle and town of trim as king robert did not yet have any legitimate male heir , edward was proclaimed his legal heir and successor as king of scotland and all other titles in case of his death '' edward meanwhile was swiftly faced by an army led by vassals of the earl of ulster such as the de mandevilles , savages , logans and bissets of the glens , and their irish allies , led by sir thomas de mandeville the irish annals state that de brus '' took the hostages and lordship of the whole province of ulster without opposition and they consented to him being proclaimed king of ireland and all the gaels of ireland agreed to grant him lordship and they called him king of ireland the second consisted of forces raised in munster and leinster by justiciar , sir edmund butler of ormonde ( father of james butler , 1st earl of ormonde ) thus when in august edward and his men crossed the bann in four ships supplied by scots sea captain , thomas dun , de burgh retreated still further to connor , where on either the first or ninth of september a charge by the scots-irish led to his defeat finally apprised of the seriousness of the situation , edward ii had on 1 september ordered an assembly of the leading anglo-irish , which met at parliament in dublin in late october , but no decisive action was taken after sacking and burning kells , edward bruce proceeded to do the same to granard , finnea , the cistercian monastery of abbeylea and raided angaile ( annually ) , the lordship of gaelic lord o hanely on 14 october 1318 , the scots-irish army was badly defeated at the battle of faughart by de bermingham 's forces the annals of ulster ( erroneously under the year 1315 ) summed up the hostile feeling held by many among the anglo-irish and irish alike of edward de brus : '' edward de brus , the destroyer of ireland in general , both foreigners and gaels , was killed by the foreigners of ireland by dint of fighting at dun-delgan and there were killed in his company mac ruaidhri , king of insi-gall hebrides and mac domhnaill , king of argyll , together with slaughter of the men of scotland around him edward bruce created havoc in the colonised parts of ireland , and might be said to have nearly brought the settlement to its knees but despite this , he failed in the end , and with him the attempt to create a kingdom of ireland and drive out the settlers ceased so while everywhere the gaelic recovery of lost territories was remarkable , there was never any serious attempt made to unite gaelic ireland or to bring about the downfall of the english government in ireland and the end of the colony
