the cultivated plant code notes that the word cultivar is used in two different senses : first , as a '' classification category '' the cultivar is defined in article 2 of the international code of nomenclature for cultivated plants ( 2009 , 8th edition ) as follows : the basic category of cultivated plants whose nomenclature is governed by this code is the cultivar a cultivar is an assemblage of plants that ( a ) & nbsp ; has been selected for a particular character or combination of characters , ( b ) & nbsp ; is distinct , uniform and stable in those characters , and ( c ) & nbsp ; when propagated by appropriate means , retains those characters this ignored its prior use as a transitive verb in spanish denoting '' to farm , to cultivate , to grow , or to practice '' ( online spanish dictionary ) , and in portuguese denoting to cultivate , to husband , to farm , to plant , to polish , to reclaim , to improve ( ectaco online portuguese dictionary ) 2.3 cultigens can have names at any of many taxonomic ranks , including those of grex , species , cultivar group , variety , form , and cultivar ; and they may be plants that have been altered in cultivation , including by genetic modification , but have not been formally denominated he recognised the rank of varietas ( botanical '' variety '' , a rank below that of species and subspecies ) and he indicated these varieties with letters of the greek alphabet , such as α , β , and λ , before the varietal name , rather than using the abbreviation '' var in that essay , bailey used only the rank of species for the cultigen , but it was obvious to him that many domesticated plants were more like botanical varieties than species , and that realization appears to have motivated the suggestion of the new category of cultivar image : dahlia - '' akita '' cultivar.pjg.jpg left thumb 220px dahlia 'akita ' a cultivar selected for flower form and colour an international cultivar registration authority ( icra ) is a voluntary , non-statutory organization appointed by the commission for nomenclature and cultivar registration of the international society of horticultural science : : brassica oleracea capitata group ( the group of cultivars including all typical cabbages ) : : brassica oleracea botrytis group ( the group of cultivars including all typical cauliflowers ) : : hydrangea macrophylla groupe hortensia ( in french ) hydrangea macrophylla hortensia group ( in english ) : where cited with a cultivar name the group should be enclosed in parentheses , as follows : : : hydrangea macrophylla ( hortensia group ) 'ayesha ' cultivated plant code art from circa the 1900s , cultivated plants in europe were recognised in the scandinavian , germanic , and slavic literature as stamm or sorte , but these words could not be used internationally because , by international agreement , any new denominations had to be in latin the main body coordinating plant breeders ' rights is the international union for the protection of new varieties of plants , upov ) and this organization maintains a database of new cultivars protected by pbr in all countries a cultigen is any plant that is deliberately selected for or altered in cultivation , as opposed to an indigen ; the cultivated plant code states that cultigens are '' maintained as recognisable entities solely by continued propagation '' liberty hyde bailey of cornell university in new york , united states created the word cultivar in 1923 when he wrote that : the cultigen is a species , or its equivalent , that has appeared under domestication – the plant is cultigenous plants protected by plant breeders ' rights ( pbr ) may have a '' true '' cultivar name – the recognized scientific name in the public domain – and a '' commercial synonym '' – an additional marketing name that is legally protected the cultivar epithet is enclosed by single quotes ; it should not be italicized if the botanical name is italicized ; cultivated plant code recommendation 8a.1 and each of the words within the epithet is capitalized ( with some permitted exceptions such as conjunctions ) image : airport orchid.jpg thumb left 220px a cultivar of the orchid genus oncidium which plants are chosen to be named as cultivars is simply a matter of convenience as the category was created to serve the practical needs of horticulture , agriculture , and forestry botanical historian alan morton noted that theophrastus in his historia plantarum ( enquiry into plants ) '' had an inkling of the limits of culturally induced ( phenotype ) changes and of the importance of genetic constitution '' ( historia plantarum , book 3 , 2 , 2 and causa plantarum , book 1 , 9 , 3 ) 14 : examples of correct text presentation : : : cryptomeria japonica 'elegans' : : chamaecyparis lawsoniana 'aureomarginata ' ( pre-1959 name , latin in form ) : : chamaecyparis lawsoniana 'golden wonder ' ( post-1959 name , english language ) : : pinus densiflora 'akebono ' ( post-1959 name , japanese language ) : : apple 'sundown' : some incorrect text presentation examples : : : cryptomeria japonica '' elegans '' ( double quotes are unacceptable ) : : berberis thunbergii cv the international code of nomenclature for algae , fungi , and plants uses as its starting point for modern botanical nomenclature the latin names in linnaeus ' ( 1707–1778 ) species plantarum ( tenth edition ) and genera plantarum ( fifth edition ) cultivated plant code , article 2.20 cultivars generally occur as ornamentals and food crops : malus 'granny smith ' and malus 'red delicious ' are cultivars of apples propagated by cuttings or grafting , lactuca 'red sails ' and lactuca 'great lakes ' are lettuce cultivars propagated by seeds i now propose another name , cultivar , for a botanical variety , or for a race subordinate to species , that has originated under cultivation ; it is not necessarily , however , referable to a recognized botanical species the propagating material may be taken from a particular part of the plant , such as a lateral branch , or from a particular phase of the life cycle , such as a juvenile leaf , or from aberrant growth as occurs with witch 's broom cultivar epithets published before 1 january 1959 were often given a latin form and can be readily confused with the specific epithets in botanical names ; after that date , newly coined cultivar epithets must be in a modern vernacular language to distinguish them from botanical epithets the production of cultivars generally entails considerable human involvement although in a few cases it may be as little as simply selecting variation from plants growing in the wild ( whether by collecting growing tissue to propagate from or by gathering seed ) however , the international code of nomenclature for cultivated plants notes , '' in practice such an assemblage is often marketed from one or more lines or multilines that have been genetically modified
