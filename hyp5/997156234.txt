a boulder or ledge in the middle of a river or near the side can obstruct the flow of the river , and can also create a '' pillow '' ; when water flows backwards upstream of the obstruction , or a '' pour over '' ( over the boulder ) ; and '' hydraulics '' or '' holes '' where the river flows back on itself—perhaps back under the drop—often with fearful results for those caught in its grasp ) if the flow passes next to the obstruction , an eddy may form behind the obstruction ; although eddies are typically sheltered areas where boaters can stop to rest , scout , or leave the main current , they may be swirling and whirlpool-like an eddy wall is formed when the height of the river is substantially higher than the level of the water in the eddy behind the obstruction this can make it difficult for a boater , who has stopped in that particular eddy , to re-enter the river due to a wall of water that can be several feet high at the point at which the eddy meets the river flow a marked increase or decrease in flow can create a rapid , '' wash out '' a rapid ( decreasing the hazard ) , or make safe passage through previously navigable rapids more difficult or impossible the most widely used grading system is the international scale of river difficulty , where whitewater ( either an individual rapid , or the entire river ) is classed in six categories from class i ( the easiest and safest ) to class vi ( the most difficult and most dangerous ) the grade reflects both the technical difficulty and the danger associated with a rapid , with grade i referring to flat or slow-moving water with few hazards , and grade vi referring to the hardest rapids , which are very dangerous even for expert paddlers , and are rarely run class 1 : very small rough areas , requires no maneuvering ( skill level : none ) class 2 : some rough water , maybe some rocks , small drops , might require maneuvering ( skill level : basic paddling ) class 3 : medium waves , maybe a 3–5 & nbsp ; ft drop , but not much considerable danger , may require significant maneuvering ( skill level : experienced paddling ) class 4 : whitewater , large waves , long rapids , rocks , maybe a considerable drop , sharp maneuvers may be needed ( skill level : advanced whitewater experience ) class 5 : whitewater , large waves , continuous rapids , large rocks and hazards , maybe a large drop , precise maneuvering , often characterized by '' must make '' moves , i.e failure to execute a specific maneuver at a specific point may result in serious injury or death , class 5 sometimes expanded to class 5+ that describes the most extreme , runnable rapids ( skill level : expert ) ; class 5+ is sometimes assigned to a rapid for commercial purposes , since insurance companies often will not cover losses sustained in a class 6 rapid class 6 : while some debate exists over the term '' class 6 '' , in practice it refers to rapids that are not passable and any attempt to do so would result in serious injury , near drowning , or death ( e.g on any given rapid , a multitude of different features can arise from the interplay between the shape of the riverbed and the velocity of the water in the stream strainers are formed by many natural or man-made objects , such as storm grates over tunnels , trees that have fallen into a river ( '' log jam '' ) , bushes by the side of the river that are flooded during high water , wire fence , rebar from broken concrete structures in the water , or other debris strainers occur naturally most often on the outside curves of rivers where the current undermines the shore , exposing the roots of trees and causing them to fall into the river and form strainers holes , or '' hydraulics '' , ( also known as '' stoppers '' or '' souse-holes '' ( see also pillows ) are formed when water pours over the top of a submerged object , or underwater ledges , causing the surface water to flow back upstream toward the object in high-volume water flows , holes can subtly aerate the water , enough to allow craft to fall through the aerated water to the bottom of a deep 'hole ' in a low-head dam , the 'hole ' has a very wide , uniform structure with no escape point , and the sides of the hydraulic ( ends of the dam ) are often blocked by a man-made wall , making paddling around , or slipping off , the side of the hydraulic , where the bypass water flow would become normal ( laminar ) , difficult the safest move for a whitewater boater approaching a lateral is to '' square up '' or turn the boat such that it hits the wave along the boat 's longest axis , reducing the chance of the boat flipping or capsizing in fluid mechanics , waves are classified as laminar , but the whitewater world has also included waves with turbulence ( '' breaking waves '' ) under the general heading of waves pillows are formed when a large flow of water runs into a large obstruction , causing water to '' pile up '' or '' boil '' against the face of the obstruction a particularly notorious undercut rock is dimple rock , in dimple rapid on the lower youghiogheny river , a very popular rafting and kayaking river in pennsylvania rafts sometimes have inflatable floors , with holes around the edges , that allow water that splashes into the boat to easily flow to the side and out the bottom ( these are typically called '' self-bailers '' because the occupants do not have to '' bail '' water out with a bucket ) others have simple fabric floors , without anyway for water to escape , these are called '' bucket boats '' , both for their tendency to hold water like a bucket , and because the only way to get water out of them is by bailing with a bucket open whitewater canoes often have large airbags and in some cases foam , usually 2-lb density ethyl foam , firmly attached to the sides , to displace water in the boat when swamped by big waves and holes and to allow water to be spilled from the boat while still in the river by floating it up on its side using the foam and bags the design is characterized by a wide , flat bottom , flared sides , a narrow , flat bow , a pointed stern , and extreme rocker in the bow and stern to allow the boat to spin about its center for ease in maneuvering in rapids the dangers can be mitigated ( but not eliminated ) by training , experience , scouting , the use of safety equipment ( such as personal flotation devices , helmets , throw ropes ) , and using other persons as '' spotters ''
