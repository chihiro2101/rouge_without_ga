the axial skeleton ( 80 bones ) is formed by the vertebral column ( 32â€“34 bones ; the number of the vertebrae differs from human to human as the lower 2 parts , sacral and coccygeal bone may vary in length ) , a part of the rib cage ( 12 pairs of ribs and the sternum ) , and the skull ( 22 bones and 7 associated bones ) the upright posture of humans is maintained by the axial skeleton , which transmits the weight from the head , the trunk , and the upper extremities down to the lower extremities at the hip joints the appendicular skeleton ( 126 bones ) is formed by the pectoral girdles , the upper limbs , the pelvic girdle or pelvis , and the lower limbs the skeleton serves six major functions : support , movement , protection , production of blood cells , storage of minerals and endocrine regulation the human skeleton is not as sexual dimorphism as that of many other primate species , but subtle differences between sexes in the morphology of the skull , dentition , long bones , and pelvis are exhibited across human populations in general , female skeletal elements tend to be smaller and less robust than corresponding male elements within a given population a variety of gross morphological traits of the human skull demonstrate sexual dimorphism , such as the nuchal lines , mastoid processes , supraorbital margin , supraorbital ridge , and the chin the human pelvis exhibits greater sexual dimorphism than other bones , specifically in the size and shape of the pelvic cavity , ilia , greater sciatic notches , and the sub-pubic angle the sacrum in the women 's pelvis is curved inwards to allow the child to have a '' funnel '' to assist in the child 's pathway from the uterus to the vagina osteoporosis is defined by the world health organization in women as a bone mineral density 2.5 standard deviations below peak bone mass , relative to the age and sex-matched average , as measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry , with the term '' established osteoporosis '' including the presence of a fragility fracture osteoporosis is most common in women after menopause , when it is called '' postmenopausal osteoporosis '' , but may develop in men and premenopausal women in the presence of particular hormonal disorders and other chronic diseases or as a result of smoking and medications , specifically glucocorticoids the text discusses such surgical techniques as making incisions , probing , foreign body , cauterization , tooth extraction , excisions , and trocar , hydrocele , prostate gland , urethral stricture , vesicolithotomy , hernia , caesarian , haemorrhoid , fistula , laparotomy and intestinal obstruction , perforated intestine and the principles of bone fracture , viz it enumerates six types of dislocations , twelve varieties of fractures , and classification of the bone and their reaction to the injuries , and gives a classification of eye diseases including cataract chinese understandings are divergent , as the closest corresponding concept in the medicinal system seems to be the meridians , although given that hua tuo regularly performed surgery , there may be some distance between medical theory and actual understanding vesalius , regarded as the founder of modern anatomy , authored the book de humani corporis fabrica , which contained many illustrations of the skeleton and other body parts , correcting some theories dating from galen , such as the lower jaw being a single bone instead of two
