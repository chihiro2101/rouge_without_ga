the knx standard has been built on the osi-based eib protocol stack extended with the physical layers , configuration modes and application experience of batibus and ehs ) radio ( knx-rf ) ip ( also referred to as eibnet/ip or knxnet/ip ) knx is not based on a specific hardware platform and a network can be controlled by anything from an 8-bit microcontroller to a pc , according to the demands of a particular building knx is an approved standard by the following organisations , ( inter alia ) : international standard ( iso/iec 14543-3 ) european standard ( cenelec en 50090 and cen en 13321-1 ) us standard ( ansi/ashrae 135 ) china guobiao ( gb/t 20965 ) it is administered by the knx association cvba , a non-profit organisation governed by belgian law which was formed in 1999 the current vendor list can be found at knx.org : this is a royalty-free open standard and thus access to the knx specifications is unrestricted the bus is routed in parallel to the electrical power supply to all devices and systems on the network linking : sensors ( e.g push buttons , thermostats , anemometers , movement ) gather information and send it on the bus as a data telegram ; actuators ( dimming units , heating valves , displays ) receive data telegrams which are then converted into actions ; and controllers and other logic functions ( room temperature controllers , shutter controllers and other ) system devices and components ( e.g installed systems can be accessed via lan , point to point links , or phone networks for central or distributed control of the system via computers , tablets and touch screens , and smartphones the key features of the knx architecture are : interworking and distributed application models for the building automation various tasks ; schemes for configuration and management of resources on the network , and to permit the binding of parts of a distributed application in different nodes ; a communication system with a message protocol and models for the communication stack in each node ( capable of hosting distributed applications ( knx common kernel ) ; and models for the realization of these elements when developing actual devices to be mounted and linked in an installation to logically link applications datapoints across the network , knx has three underlying binding schemes : one for free , one for structured and one for tagged binding : in free binding , links between datapoints are not prescribed - in combination with free addressing , this supports customized multicast grouping at the level of individual datapoints and is central to s-mode configuration ( see below ) ; in structured binding , the knx specification stipulates a precise pattern for linking a whole set of datapoints , usually corresponding to a functional block or channel ( push-button modes follow this concept ) ; tagged binding is also pre-structured by the application models , but the numerical value of address is part of its value it is osi 7-layer model compliant : a general data link layer , which sits above the specific data link layers for each medium , provides access control and the logical link control ; a network layer ( for nodes with routing functionality ) provides a segment-wise acknowledged telegram ( frame ) and controls the hop count of a frame ; a transport layer enables four types of communication : one-to-many connectionless ( multicast ) , one-to-all connectionless ( broadcast ) , one-to-one connectionless , one-to-one connection-oriented ; ( osi session and presentation layers are empty ) ; and an application layer offers a toolkit of services to the application process configuration may be achieved through a combination of local activity on the devices ( such pushing a button ) , and active network management communication over the bus ( peer-to-peer , or more centralized master-slave ) there are three categories of knx devices : a-mode or '' automatic mode '' devices which can configure themselves , and are able to be installed by the end user ; e-mode or '' easy mode '' devices that require basic training to install : their behaviour is pre-programmed , but configuration parameters need to be tailored to the user 's requirements ; or s-mode or '' system mode '' devices that can be used to create sophisticated building automation systems : they have no default behaviour , and must be programmed and installed by specialists a knx wired network can be formed with tree , line and star topologies , which can be mixed as needed ; ring topologies are not supported the lowest eight bits provide up to 256 addresses within one line , which can consist of up to four segments , each having a maximum of 64 ( tp1-64 ) devices , or up to 256 ( tp1-256 ) devices knx telegrams can be signed or encrypted thanks to the extension of the protocol that was developed starting in 2013 , knx data secure for securing telegrams on the traditional knx media tp and rf and knx ip secure for securing knx telegrams tunnelled via ip
