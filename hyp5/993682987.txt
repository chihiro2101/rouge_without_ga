for example , the index set fin of class of all finite sets is on the level σ 2 , the index set rec of the class of all recursive sets is on the level σ 3 , the index set cofin of all cofinite sets is also on the level σ 3 and the index set comp of the class of all turing-complete sets σ 4 a set of natural numbers is said to be a computable set ( also called a decidable , recursive , or turing computable set ) if there is a turing machine that , given a number n , halts with output 1 if n is in the set and halts with output 0 if n is not in the set in both cases , cooper claims to have constructed nontrivial automorphisms which map some degrees to other degrees ; this construction has , however , not been verified and some colleagues believe that the construction contains errors and that the question of whether there is a nontrivial automorphism of the turing degrees is still one of the main unsolved questions in this area ( slaman and woodin 1986 , ambos-spies and fejer 2006 ) informally , a set of natural numbers a is turing reduction to a set b if there is an oracle machine that correctly tells whether numbers are in a when run with b as the oracle set ( in this case , the set a is also said to be ( relatively ) computable from b and recursive in b ) both reprintings have the following footnote added to the davis volume by gödel in 1965 : '' to be more precise : a function of integers is computable in any formal system containing arithmetic if and only if it is computable in arithmetic , where a function f is called computable in s if there is in s a computable term representing f ( p there are close relationships between the turing degree of a set of natural numbers and the difficulty ( in terms of the arithmetical hierarchy ) of defining that set using a first-order logic extending this result , pyotr novikov and william boone showed independently in the 1950s that the word problem for groups is not effectively solvable : there is no effective procedure that , given a word in a finitely presented group , will decide whether the element represented by the word is the identity element of the group the field of kolmogorov complexity and algorithmic randomness was developed during the 1960s and 1970s by chaitin , kolmogorov , levin , martin-löf and solomonoff ( the names are given here in alphabetical order ; much of the research was independent , and the unity of the concept of randomness was not understood at the time ) the idea is that a computable bijection merely renames numbers in a set , rather than indicating any structure in the set , much as a rotation of the euclidean plane does not change any geometric aspect of lines drawn on it that is , given such sets a and b , there is a total computable function f such that a has the property that either the halting problem or its complement is many-one reducible to e , that is , can be mapped using a many-one reduction to e ( see rice 's theorem for more detail ) an oracle turing machine is a hypothetical device which , in addition to performing the actions of a regular turing machine , is able to ask questions of an oracle , which is a particular set of natural numbers rogers ( 1967 ) has suggested that a key property of recursion theory is that its results and structures should be invariant under computable bijections on the natural numbers ( this suggestion draws on the ideas of the erlangen program in geometry ) beginning with the theory of recursive sets and functions described above , the field of recursion theory has grown to include the study of many closely related topics a numbering is an enumeration of functions ; it has two parameters , e and x and outputs the value of the e-th function in the numbering on the input x post 's original motivation in the study of this lattice was to find a structural notion such that every set which satisfies this property is neither in the turing degree of the recursive sets nor in the turing degree of the halting problem in contemporary use , the term '' computable function '' has various definitions : according to cutland ( 1980 ) , it is a partial recursive function ( which can be undefined for some inputs ) , while according to soare ( 1987 ) it is a total recursive ( equivalently , general recursive ) function thus the halting problem is an example of a recursively enumerable set , which is a set that can be enumerated by a turing machine ( other terms for recursively enumerable include computably enumerable and semidecidable ) according to rogers , the sets of interest in recursion theory are the noncomputable sets , partitioned into equivalence classes by computable bijections of the natural numbers a function f from the natural numbers to themselves is a recursive or ( turing ) computable function if there is a turing machine that , on input n , halts and returns output f ( n ) maximal sets ( as defined in the previous paragraph ) have the property that they can not be automorphic to non-maximal sets , that is , if there is an automorphism of the recursive enumerable sets under the structure just mentioned , then every maximal set is mapped to another maximal set recursion theory in mathematical logic has traditionally focused on relative computability , a generalization of turing computability defined using oracle turing machines , introduced by turing & nbsp ; ( 1939 ) the existence of many noncomputable sets follows from the facts that there are only countable set turing machines , and thus only countably many computable sets , but according to the cantor 's theorem , there are uncountable set sets of natural numbers to use this method , the desired properties of the set to be constructed are broken up into an infinite list of goals , known as requirements , so that satisfying all the requirements will cause the set constructed to have the desired properties the definition in terms of μ-recursive functions as well as a different definition of rekursiv functions by gödel led to the traditional name recursive for sets and functions computable by a turing machine the first major result in this branch of recursion theory is trakhtenbrot 's result that a set is computable if it is ( m , & nbsp ; n ) -recursive for some m , & nbsp ; n with 2m & nbsp ; > & nbsp ; n recursion theory originated in the 1930s , with work of kurt gödel , alonzo church , rózsa péter , alan turing , stephen kleene , and emil post the field of proof theory includes the study of second-order arithmetic and peano arithmetic , as well as formal theories of the natural numbers weaker than peano arithmetic the use of turing machines here is not necessary ; there are many other model of computation that have the same computing power as turing machines ; for example the mu-recursive function obtained from primitive recursion and the μ operator the halting problem , which is the set of ( descriptions of ) turing machines that halt on input 0 , is a well-known example of a noncomputable set
