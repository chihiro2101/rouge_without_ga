this may be irrelevant if the cutoff wavelengths are outside of the application range or outside of the photocathode sensitivity range , but special care has to be taken for uncommon wavelengths by october 1935 , zworykin , george ashmun morton , and louis malter of rca in camden , nj submitted their manuscript describing the first comprehensive experimental and theoretical analysis of a multiple dynode tube — the device later called a photomultiplier — to proc photomultiplier technology was pursued to enable television camera tubes , such as the iconoscope and ( later ) the orthicon , to be sensitive enough to be practical for example , if at each stage an average of 5 new electrons are produced for each incoming electron , and if there are 12 dynode stages , then at the last stage one expects for each primary electron about 5 12 ≈ 10 8 electrons whereas these early photomultipliers used the magnetic field principle , electrostatic photomultipliers ( with no magnetic field ) were demonstrated by jan rajchman of rca laboratories in princeton , nj in the late 1930s and became the standard for all future commercial photomultipliers besides the different photocathode materials , performance is also affected by the transmission of the window material that the light passes through , and by the arrangement of the dynodes the addition of caesium , another alkali metal , has permitted the range of sensitive wavelengths to be extended towards longer wavelengths in the red portion of the visible spectrum it is worthwhile to note that heinrich hertz , working 18 years earlier , had not recognized that the kinetic energy of the emitted electrons is proportional to the frequency but independent of the optical intensity negative high-voltage supplies ( with the positive terminal grounded ) are often preferred , because this configuration enables the photocurrent to be measured at the low voltage side of the circuit for amplification by subsequent electronic circuits operating at low voltage if used in a location with strong magnetic fields , which can curve electron paths , steer the electrons away from the dynodes and cause loss of gain , photomultipliers are usually magnetically shielded by a layer of soft iron or mu-metal typically the materials have low work function and are therefore prone to thermionic emission , causing noise and dark current , especially the materials sensitive in infrared ; cooling the photocathode lowers this thermal noise numerous visits were made by rca scientific personnel to the ussr in the 1930s , prior to the cold war , to instruct the soviet customers on the capabilities of rca equipment and to investigate customer needs harley iams and bernard salzberg were the first to integrate a photoelectric-effect cathode and single secondary emission amplification stage in a single vacuum envelope and the first to characterize its performance as a photomultiplier with electron amplification gain another option is to add overcurrent protection in the external circuit , so that when the measured anode current exceeds a safe limit , the high voltage is reduced a primary electron leaves the photocathode with the energy of the incoming photon , or about 3 & nbsp ; ev for '' blue '' photons , minus the work function of the photocathode perhaps its most useful quality is that it acts , electronically , as a nearly perfect current source , owing to the high voltage utilized in extracting the tiny currents associated with weak light signals following a corporate break-up in the late 1980s involving the acquisition of rca by general electric and disposition of the divisions of rca to numerous third parties , rca 's photomultiplier business became an independent company however , owing to the avalanche of current , a reset of the photomultiplier is required 1 , the number of primary electrons in the initial group is proportional to the energy of the incident high energy gamma ray photon counting ( as it is called ) reveals that light , not only being a wave , consists of discrete particles ( i.e photomultiplier-amplified photocurrents can be electronically amplified by a high-input-impedance electronic amplifier ( in the signal path subsequent to the photomultiplier ) , thus producing appreciable voltages even for nearly infinitesimally small photon fluxes the caesium-antimony photocathode had a dramatically improved quantum efficiency of 12 % at 400 & nbsp ; nm , and was used in the first commercially successful photomultipliers manufactured by rca ( i.e historically , the photoelectric effect is associated with albert einstein , who relied upon the phenomenon to establish the fundamental principle of quantum mechanics in 1905 , an accomplishment for which einstein received the 1921 nobel prize the work was submitted for print publication only two years later , in july 1936 as emphasized in a recent 2006 publication of the russian academy of sciences ( ras ) , which terms it '' kubetsky 's tube photomultipliers are used in research laboratories to measure the intensity and spectrum of light-emitting materials such as compound semiconductors and quantum dots the aforementioned refers to measurement of light fluxes that , while small , nonetheless amount to a continuous stream of multiple photons
