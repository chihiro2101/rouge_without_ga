this discovery came after the realization that bacteria possess proteins that are homologous to tubulin and actin ; the main components of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton intermediate filaments are composed of various proteins , depending on the type of cell in which they are found ; they are normally 8-12 & nbsp ; nm in diameter the cytoskeleton provides the cell with structure and shape , and by excluding macromolecules from some of the cytosol , it adds to the level of macromolecular crowding in this compartment excess glutamine in the huntington protein involved with linking vesicles onto the cytoskeleton is also proposed to be a factor in the development of huntington 's disease accessory proteins including motor proteins regulate and link the filaments to other cell compounds and each other and are essential for controlled assembly of cytoskeletal filaments in particular locations microfilaments , also known as actin filaments , are composed of linear polymers of g-actin proteins , and generate force when the growing ( plus ) end of the filament pushes against a barrier , such as the cell membrane like actin filaments , they function in the maintenance of cell-shape by bearing tension ( microtubules , by contrast , resist compression but can also bear tension during mitosis and during the positioning of the centrosome ) intermediate filaments are most commonly known as the support system or “ scaffolding ” for the cell and nucleus while also playing a role in some cell functions in combination with proteins and desmosomes , the intermediate filaments form cell-cell connections and anchor the cell-matrix junctions that are used in messaging between cells as well as vital functions of the cell these connections allow the cell to communicate through the desmosome of multiple cells to adjust structures of the tissue based on signals from the cells environment as both flagella and cilia are structural components of the cell , and are maintained by microtubules , they can be considered part of the cytoskeleton the function of septins in cells include serving as a localized attachment site for other proteins , and preventing the diffusion of certain molecules from one cell compartment to another cortical patches are discrete actin bodies on the membrane and are vital for endocytosis , especially the recycling of glucan synthase which is important for cell wall synthesis actin cables are bundles of actin filaments and are involved in the transport of vesicles towards the cap ( which contains a number of different proteins to polarize cell growth ) and in the positioning of mitochondria however , research in the early '90s suggested that bacteria and archaea had homologues of actin and tubulin , and that these were the basis of eukaryotic microtubules and microfilaments although the evolutionary relationships are so distant that they are not obvious from protein sequence comparisons alone , the similarity of their three-dimensional structures and similar functions in maintaining cell shape and polarity provides strong evidence that the eukaryotic and prokaryotic cytoskeletons are truly homologous three laboratories independently discovered that ftsz , a protein already known as a key player in bacterial cytokinesis , had the '' tubulin signature sequence '' present in all α- , β- , and γ-tubulins during cell division , ftsz is the first protein to move to the division site , and is essential for recruiting other proteins that synthesize the new cell wall between the dividing cells all non-spherical bacteria have genes encoding actin-like proteins , and these proteins form a helical network beneath the cell membrane that guides the proteins involved in cell wall biosynthesis crescentin is also involved in maintaining cell shape , such as helical and vibrioid forms of bacteria , but the mechanism by which it does this is currently unclear for example , dna segregation in all eukaryotes happens through use of tubulin , but in prokaryotes either waca proteins , actin-like or tubulin-like proteins can be used cell division is mediated in eukaryotes by actin , but in prokaryotes usually by tubulin-like ( often ftsz-ring ) proteins and sometimes ( crenarchaeota ) escrt-iii , which in eukaryotes still has a role in the last step of division cytoplasmic streaming , also known as cyclosis , is the active movement of a cell ’ s contents along the components of the cytoskeleton while mainly seen in plants , all cell types use this process for transportation of waste , nutrients , and organelles to other parts of the cell
