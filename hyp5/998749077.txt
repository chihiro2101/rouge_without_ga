'' to reconcile the two parties , nachmanides proposed that the ban against the philosophical portion of maimonides 's code of jewish law should be revoked , but that the ban against the study of the guide for the perplexed , and against those who rejected allegorical interpretation of the bible , should be maintained and even strengthened he was prompted to record his commentary by three motives : ( 1 ) to satisfy the minds of students of the law and stimulate their interest by a critical examination of the text ; ( 2 ) to justify the ways of god and discover the hidden meanings of the words of scripture , '' for in the torah are hidden every wonder and every mystery , and in her treasures is sealed every beauty of wisdom '' ;

whether the messiah announced by the prophets was to be considered as divine or as a man born of human parents whether the jews or the christians were in possession of the true faith the justness of his defense was recognized by the king and the commission , but to satisfy the dominicans , nachmanides was sentenced to exile for two years and his pamphlet was condemned to be burned shortly after his arrival in jerusalem , he addressed a letter to his son nahman , in which he described the desolation of the holy city , where there were at that time only two jewish inhabitants—brothers , dyers by trade the reason given by him for this bold statement was that it was more meritorious for the jews to observe the precepts under a christian ruler , while in exile and suffering humiliation and abuse , than under the rule of the messiah , when every one would perforce act in accordance with the law his commentary on the creation of the world describes the heavens and the earth being created out of a noncorporeal substance : as in his preceding works , he vehemently attacks the greek philosophy , especially aristotle , and frequently criticizes maimonides ' biblical interpretations however , the great respect he professed for maimonides ( though he did not share the latter 's views ) , reinforced by innate gentleness of character , kept him from allying himself with the anti-maimonist party and led him to assume the role of a conciliator the debate was initiated by a pablo christiani , a jewish convert to christianity , who had been sent by the dominican master general , raymond de penyafort , to king james i of aragon , with the request that the king order ramban to respond to charges against judaism
