robert adams points to the limitations of any single definition of 'empowerment ' , and the danger that academic or specialist definitions might take away the word and the connected practices from the very people they are supposed to belong to still , he offers a minimal definition of the term : 'empowerment : the capacity of individuals , groups and/or communities to take control of their circumstances , exercise power and achieve their own goals , and the process by which , individually and collectively , they are able to help themselves and others to maximize the quality of their lives new york : palgrave macmillan , 2008 , p.xvi one definition for the term is '' an intentional , ongoing process centered in the local community , involving mutual respect , critical reflection , caring , and group participation , through which people lacking an equal share of resources gain greater access to and control over those resources '' rappaport 's ( 1984 ) definition includes : '' empowerment is viewed as a process : the mechanism by which people , organizations , and communities gain mastery over their lives empowerment is the process of obtaining basic opportunities for marginalized people , either directly by those people , or through the help of non-marginalized others who share their own access to these opportunities one empowerment strategy is to assist marginalized people to create their own nonprofit organization , using the rationale that only the marginalized people , themselves , can know what their own people need most , and that control of the organization by outsiders can actually help to further entrench marginalization red cross , for example , can focus on improving the health of indigenous people , but does not have authority in its charter to install water-delivery and purification systems , even though the lack of such a system profoundly , directly and negatively impacts health a nonprofit composed of the indigenous people , however , could ensure their own organization does have such authority and could set their own agendas , make their own plans , seek the needed resources , do as much of the work as they can , and take responsibility – and credit – for the success of their projects ( or the consequences , should they fail ) the process of which enables individuals/groups to fully access personal or collective power , authority and influence , and to employ that strength when engaging with other people , institutions or society in other words , '' empowerment is not giving people power , people already have plenty of power , in the wealth of their knowledge and motivation , to do their jobs magnificently '' it encourages people to gain the skills and knowledge that will allow them to overcome obstacles in life or work environment and ultimately , help them develop within themselves or in the society before there can be the finding that a particular group requires empowerment and that therefore their self-esteem needs to be consolidated on the basis of awareness of their strengths , there needs to be a deficit diagnosis usually carried out by experts assessing the problems of this group for example , this allows clients not to be seen as passive , helpless 'victims ' to be rescued but instead as a self-empowered person fighting abuse/ oppression ;
