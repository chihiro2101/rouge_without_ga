in later hellenistic greek theatres the proskenion ( προσκήνιον ) was a rather narrow raised stage where solo actors performed , while the greek chorus and musicians remained in the '' orchestra '' in front and below it , and there were often further areas for performing from above and behind the proskenion , on and behind the skene skene is the greek word ( meaning '' tent '' ) for the tent , and later building , at the back of the stage from which actors entered , and which often supported painted scenery 168 , 1993 , oup , in ancient rome , the stage area in front of the scaenae frons ( equivalent to the greek skene ) was known as the pulpitum , and the vertical front dropping from the stage to the orchestra floor , often in stone and decorated , as the proscaenium , again meaning '' in front of the skene '' in the greek and roman theatre , no proscenium arch existed , in the modern sense , and the acting space was always fully in the view of the audience however , roman theatres were similar to modern proscenium theatres in the sense that the entire audience had a restricted range of views on the stage—all of which were from the front , rather than the sides or back no proscenium arch divides the seating area from the '' proscenium '' ( stage ) , and the space between the two has been made as open as possible , without endangering the structural integrity of the building it has a plain proscaenium at the front of the stage , dropping to the orchestra level , now usually containing '' stalls '' seating , but no proscenium arch parma has a clearly defined '' boccascena '' , or scene mouth , as italians call it , more like a picture frame than an arch but serving the same purpose : to delineate the stage and separate the audience from its action the introduction of an orchestra pit for musicians during the baroque era further devalued the proscaenium , bringing the lowest level of the audience 's view forward to the front of the pit , where a barrier , typically in wood , screened the pit this emulation of the roman model extended to refer to the stage area as the '' proscenium '' , and some writers have incorrectly referred to the theatre 's scaenae frons as a proscenium , and have even suggested that the central archway in the middle of the scaenae frons was the inspiration for the later development of the full-size proscenium arch in practice , however , the stage in the teatro olimpico runs from one edge of the seating area to the other , and only a very limited framing effect is created by the coffered ceiling over the stage and by the partition walls at the corners of the stage where the seating area abuts the floorboards anything that is not meant to be seen is simply placed outside the '' window '' created by the proscenium arch , either in the wings or in the flyspace above the stage many modern theatres attempt to do away with the fourth wall concept and so are instead designed with a thrust stage that projects out of the proscenium arch and '' reaches '' into the audience ( technically , this can still be referred to as a proscenium theatre because it still contains a proscenium arch , however the term thrust stage is more specific and more widely used ) in addition , since dancing was considered a way of socializing , most of the court ballets finished with a ‘ grand ballet ’ followed by a ball in which the members of the audience joined the performance
