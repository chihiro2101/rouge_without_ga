he was educated privately , for his health , and so that he could act as amanuensis to his blind father he applied himself to mathematical study , was awarded the degree of bachelor of arts ( ba ) ( 1690 ) , and am ( 1693 ) , and was elected fellow in 1691 and probationary senior fellow in 1693 in 1694 , claiming ill health , he resigned his tutorship at clare to richard laughton , chaplain to john moore , the bishop of norwich , and swapped positions with him in 1707 whiston was boyle lecturer ; this lecture series was at the period a significant opportunity for newton 's followers , including richard bentley and samuel clarke , to express their views , especially in opposition to the rise of deism the '' newtonian '' line came to include , with bentley , clarke and whiston in particular , a defence of natural law by returning to the definition of augustine of hippo of a miracle ( a cause of human wonderment ) , rather than the prevailing concept of a divine intervention against nature , which went back to anselm on the other hand , whiston was alive to possible connections of prophecy with current affairs : the war of the spanish succession , and later the jacobite rebellions the new cosmogonies of burnet , whiston and john woodward were all criticised for their disregard of the biblical account , by john arbuthnot , john edwards and william nicolson in particular whiston had started writing on the millenarianism that was integral to the newtonian theology , and wanted to distance his views from theirs , and in particular from those of john lacy one view is that the relationship was never very close , bentley being more involved in whiston 's appointment to the lucasian chair ; and that it deteriorated as soon as whiston began to write on prophecy , publishing essay on the revelation of st john ( 1706 ) there is evidence from hopton haynes that newton reacted by pulling back from publication on the issue ; his antitrinitarian views , from the 1690s , were finally published in 1754 as an historical account of two notable corruptions of scripture whiston 's route to rejection of the nicene creed , the historical orthodox position against arianism , began early in his tenure of the lucasian chair as he followed hints from samuel clarke in 1710 he was deprived of his professorship and expelled from the university whiston founded a society for promoting primitive christianity , lecturing in support of his theories in halls and coffee house at london , bath , and tunbridge wells in 1715 , he lectured on the total solar eclipse of 3 may 1715 ( which fell in april old style in england ) ; whiston lectured on it at the time , in covent garden , and later , as a natural event and as a portent in 1714 , he was instrumental in the passing of the longitude act , which established the board of longitude in collaboration with humphrey ditton he published a new method for discovering the longitude , both at sea and land , which was widely referenced and discussed for the next forty years he continued to propose a range of methods to solve the longitude prize , which earned him widespread ridicule , particularly from the group of writers known as the scriblerians whiston 's a new theory of the earth ( 1696 ) was an articulation of creationism and flood geology westfall absolves whiston of the charge that he pushed for the posthumous publication of the chronology just to attack it , commenting that the heirs were in any case looking to publish manuscripts of newton , who died in 1727 his last '' famous discovery , or rather revival of dr giles fletcher , the elder 's , '' which he mentions in his autobiography , was the identification of the tatars with the lost tribes of israel he had a happy family life and died in lyndon hall , rutland , at the home of his son-in-law , samuel barker , on 22 august 1752 these do not contain the account of the proceedings taken against him at cambridge for his antitrinitarianism , which was published separately at the time biography of william whiston at the lucasianchair.org , the homepage of the lucasian chair of mathematics at cambridge university bibliography for william whiston at the lucasianchair.org the homepage of the lucasian chair of mathematics at cambridge university whiston 's mactutor biography '' account of newton '' , collection of authentick records ( 1728 ) , pp & nbsp ;
