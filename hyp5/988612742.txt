the image is originally captured in rgb form and then processed into three signals known as ypbpr to play back composite video , the y and c signals must be separated , and this is difficult to do without adding artifacts to retain that quality in the final image , it is desirable to eliminate as many of the encoding/decoding steps as possible as s-video maintains the two as separate signals , such detrimental low-pass filtering for luminance is unnecessary , although the chrominance signal still has limited bandwidth relative to component video compared with component video , which carries the identical luminance signal but separates the color-difference signals into cb/pb and cr/pr , the color resolution of s-video is limited by the modulation on a subcarrier frequency of 3.57 to 4.43 megahertz , depending on the standard carrying the color information as one signal means that the color has to be encoded in some way , typically in accord with ntsc , pal , or secam , depending on the applicable local standard it is possible for a player to output s-video over scart , but televisions ' scart connectors are not necessarily wired to accept it , and if not the display would show only a monochrome image the european usage of rgb video is because the rgb quality of most retro computers and consoles is better than s-video the commodore 64 released in 1982 ( with the exception of the earliest revisions using a 5-pin video port ) also offers separate chroma and luma signals using a different connector although commodore business machines did not use the term '' s-video '' as the standard did not formally exist until 1987 , a simple adapter connects the computer 's '' lca '' ( luma-chroma-audio ) 8-pin din socket to a s-video display , or an s-video device to the commodore 1702 monitor 's lca jacks a 7-pin socket accepts , and is pin compatible with , a standard 4-pin s-video plug the three extra sockets may be used to supply composite video , an rgb or ypbpr video signal , or an iÂ²c interface
