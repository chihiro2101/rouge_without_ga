this influence of target binding on ca 2+ affinity is believed to allow for ca 2+ activation of proteins that are constitutively bound to calmodulin , such as small-conductance ca 2+ -activated potassium ( sk ) channels “ canonical ” targets of calmodulin , such as myosin light-chain kinases and camkii , bind only to the ca 2+ -bound protein , whereas some proteins , such as nav channels and iq-motif proteins , also bind to calmodulin in the absence of ca 2+ this mlc kinase is activated by a calmodulin when it is bound by calcium , thus making smooth muscle contraction dependent on the presence of calcium , through the binding of calmodulin and activation of mlc kinase however , high calcium levels can be toxic to a plant 's cellular energy metabolism and , hence , the ca 2+ concentration in the cytosol is maintained at a submicromolar level by removing the cytosolic ca 2+ to either the apoplast or the lumen of the intracellular organelles the atbag6 protein is a cam-binding protein that binds to cam only in the absence of ca 2+ and not in the presence of it there is a ca 2+ flux at the tip of the root hair initially followed by repetitive oscillation of ca 2+ in the cytosol and also ca 2+ spike occurs around the nucleus furthermore , target binding alters the binding affinity of calmodulin toward ca 2+ ions , which allows for complex allosteric interplay between ca 2+ and target binding interactions the protein has two approximately symmetrical globular domains ( the n- and c- domains ) each containing a pair of ef hand motifs separated by a flexible linker region for a total of four ca 2+ binding sites , two in each globular domain the calcium channels , such as the ryanodine receptor of the sarcoplasmic reticulum , can be inhibited by calmodulin bound to calcium , thus affecting the overall levels of calcium in the cell moreover , the predominantly hydrophobic nature of binding between calmodulin and most of its targets allows for recognition of a broad range of target protein sequences the actions of calcitonin can be blocked by inhibiting the actions of calmodulin , suggesting that calmodulin plays a crucial role in the activation of calcitonin this is a very important function of calmodulin because it indirectly plays a role in every physiological process that is affected by smooth muscle contraction such as digestion and contraction of arteries ( which helps distribute blood and regulate blood pressure ) calcium binding by calmodulin exhibits considerable cooperativity , making calmodulin an unusual example of a monomeric ( single-chain ) cooperative-binding protein it does this by binding various targets in the cell including a large number of enzymes , ion channels , aquaporins and other proteins many of the proteins that calmodulin binds are unable to bind calcium themselves , and use calmodulin as a calcium sensor and signal transducer cml43 is a cam-related protein that , as isolated from apr134 gene in the disease-resistant leaves of arabidopsis for gene expression analysis , is rapidly induced when the leaves are inoculated with pseudomonas syringae however , these cam-binding protein kinase are also present in the shoot apical meristem of tobacco and a high concentration of these kinases in the meristem causes a delayed transition to flowering in the plant binding of calmodulin induces conformational rearrangements in the target protein via “ mutually induced fit ” , leading to changes in the target protein ’ s function calmodulin is expressed in many cell types and can have different subcellular locations , including the cytoplasm , within organelles , or associated with the plasma or organelle membranes , but it is always found intracellularly the difference between plants and animals in ca 2+ signaling is that the plants contain an extended family of the cam in addition to the evolutionarily conserved form binding of ca 2+ by the ef-hands causes an opening of the n- and c-domains , which exposes hydrophobic target-binding surfaces ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ii ( camkii ) plays a crucial role in a type of synaptic plasticity known as long-term potentiation ( ltp ) which requires the presence of calcium/calmodulin
