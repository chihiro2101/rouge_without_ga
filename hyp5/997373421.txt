in the 1990s , interest in cbr grew internationally , as evidenced by the establishment of an international conference on case-based reasoning in 1995 , as well as european , german , british , italian , and other cbr workshops cbr technology has resulted in the deployment of a number of successful systems , the earliest being lockheed 's clavier , bill mark , '' case-based reasoning for autoclave management , '' proceedings of the case-based reasoning workshop ( 1989 ) cbr has been used extensively in help desk applications such as the compaq smart system trung nguyen , mary czerwinski , and dan lee , '' compaq quicksource : providing the consumer with the power of artificial intelligence , '' in proceedings of the fifth annual conference on innovative applications of artificial intelligence ( washington , dc : aaai press , 1993 ) , 142-151 other schools of cbr and closely allied fields emerged in the 1980s , which directed at topics such as legal reasoning , memory-based reasoning ( a way of reasoning from examples on massively parallel machines ) , and combinations of cbr with other reasoning methods case-based reasoning has been formalized for purposes of computer reasoning as a four-step process : agnar aamodt and enric plaza , '' case-based reasoning : foundational issues , methodological variations , and system approaches , '' artificial intelligence communications 7 ( 1994 ) : 1 , 39-52 while cbr in law and cognitively inspired cbr have long been associated , the former is more clearly an interpolation of rule based reasoning , and judgment , while the latter is more closely tied to recall and process adaptation like a rule-induction algorithm , cbr starts with a set of cases or training examples ; it forms generalizations of these examples , albeit implicit ones , by identifying commonalities between a retrieved case and the target problem in law , there is often explicit delegation of cbr to courts , recognizing the limits of rule based reasons : limiting delay , limited knowledge of future context , limit of negotiated agreement , etc there is recent work that develops cbr within a statistical framework and formalizes case-based inference as a specific type of probabilistic inference ; thus , it becomes possible to produce case-based predictions equipped with a certain level of confidence in the pancake example , cbr has already been given the target problem of cooking blueberry pancakes ; thus it can generalize its cases exactly as needed to cover this situation for instance , if a rule-induction algorithm were given recipes for plain pancakes , dutch apple pancakes , and banana pancakes as its training examples , it would have to derive , at training time , a set of general rules for making all types of pancakes retain : after the solution has been successfully adapted to the target problem , store the resulting experience as a new case in memory if for instance a procedure for plain pancakes is mapped to blueberry pancakes , a decision is made to use the same basic batter and frying method , thus implicitly generalizing the set of situations under which the batter and frying method can be used revise : having mapped the previous solution to the target situation , test the new solution in the real world ( or a simulation ) and , if necessary , revise this is in contrast to cbr , which delays ( implicit ) generalization of its cases until testing time â€“ a strategy of lazy generalization
