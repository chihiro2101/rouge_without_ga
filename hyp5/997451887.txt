time may be viewed as going in one direction , such as from the bottom to the top of the diagram , but for closed spin networks the direction of time is irrelevant to calculations 241 ( the latter paper was presented in 1969 but published in 1971 according to roger penrose , '' on the origins of twistor theory '' in : gravitation and geometry , a volume in honour of i a spin network , immersed into a manifold , can be used to define a functional on the space of connections on this manifold one of the key results of loop quantum gravity is quantization of areas : the operator of the area a of a two-dimensional surface σ should have a discrete spectrum the set of all possible spin networks ( or , more accurately , '' s-knots '' that is , equivalence classes of spin networks under diffeomorphisms ) is countable ; it constitutes a basis of lqg hilbert space in mathematics , spin networks have been used to study skein modules and character variety , which correspond to spaces of connections in loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) , a spin network represents a '' quantum state '' of the gravitational field on a 3-dimensional hypersurface more formally , a spin network is a ( directed ) graph whose edges are associated with irreducible representations of a compact lie group and whose vertices are associated with intertwiners of the edge representations adjacent to it every spin network is an eigenstate of each such operator , and the area eigenvalue equals : a_ where the sum goes over all intersections i of σ with the spin network given any closed spin network , a non-negative integer can be calculated which is called the norm of the spin network one can think that every node in a spin network is an elementary '' quantum of volume '' and every link is a '' quantum of area '' surrounding this volume one computes holonomy of the connection along every link ( closed path ) of the graph , determines representation matrices corresponding to every link , multiplies all matrices and intertwiners together , and contracts indices in a prescribed way
