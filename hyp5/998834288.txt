on 16 november 1935 , the contract for flugzeugträger a ( aircraft carrier a ) & mdash ; later christened graf zeppelin & mdash ; was awarded to the deutsche werke shipyard in kiel construction of the ship was delayed since deutsche werke was working at capacity , and the slipway needed for graf zeppelin was occupied by the new battleship , which was launched on 8 december 1936 she was launched on 8 december 1938 , the 24th anniversary of the battle of the falkland islands , gardiner & chesneau , p 67 & ndash ; 69 by the end of 1939 , she was 85 % complete , with a projected completion by the middle of 1940 227 by september 1939 , one carrier-borne wing , trägergruppe 186 , had been formed by the luftwaffe at kiel holtenau , composed of three squadrons equipped with bf 109s and ju 87s during a naval conference with hitler on 28 april 1940 , admiral erich raeder proposed halting all work on graf zeppelin , arguing that even if she was commissioned by the end of 1940 , final installation of her guns would need another ten months or more ( her original fire-control system had been sold to the soviet union under an earlier trade agreement ) 30 in july 1940 , graf zeppelin was towed from kiel to gotenhafen ( gdynia ) and remained there for nearly a year 72 just before germany invaded the soviet union in june 1941 , the carrier was again moved , this time to stettin , to safeguard her from soviet air attacks 157 by the time raeder met with hitler for a detailed discussion of naval strategy in april 1942 , the usefulness of aircraft carriers in modern naval warfare had been amply demonstrated reichsmarshall hermann göring , head of the luftwaffe , replied that the already overburdened german aircraft industry could not possibly complete the design , testing and mass production of such aircraft before 1946 the converted carrier aircraft were heavier versions of their land-based predecessors and this required a host of changes to graf zeppelins original design : the existing catapults needed modernization ; stronger winches were necessary for the arresting gear ; the flight deck , elevators and hangar floors also required reinforcement 283 changes in naval technology dictated other alterations as well : installation of air search radar sets and antennas ; upgraded radio equipment ; an armored fighter-director cabin mounted on the main mast ( which in turn meant a heavier , sturdier mast to accommodate the cabin 's added weight ) ; extra armoring for the bridge and fire control center ; a new curved funnel cap to shield the fighter-director cabin from smoke ; replacing the single-mount 20mm aa guns with quadruple flakvierling 38 guns ( with a corresponding increase in ammunition supply ) to improve overall aa defense ; and additional bulges on either side of the hull to preserve the ship 's stability under all this added weight on the night of 27–28 august 1942 , while still moored at gotenhafen , graf zeppelin was the target of the only allied air attack aimed at her during the war it seemed she might well see completion after all , but by late january 1943 hitler had become so disenchanted with the kriegsmarine , especially with what he perceived as the poor performance of its surface fleet , that he ordered all of its larger ships taken out of service and scrapped in april 1943 graf zeppelin was again towed eastward , first to gotenhafen , then to the roadstead at swinemünde and finally berthed at a back-water wharf in the parnitz river , two miles ( 3 & nbsp ; km ) from stettin , where she had been briefly docked in 1941 the carrier 's history and fate after germany 's surrender was unknown outside the soviet union for decades after the war the soviets could not repair the ship in the length of time specified by the terms of the tripartite naval commission , so she was designated a '' category c '' ship naval historians robert gardiner and roger chesneau state that the ship was towed out of stettin in september 1947 , but she never arrived in leningrad ; they speculated that a mine sank the ship while she was under tow on 12 july 2006 , the research vessel , a ship belonging to the polish oil company petrobaltic , found a wreck north of władysławowo , which they thought was most likely graf zeppelin
