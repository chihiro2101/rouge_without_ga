the sources for áedán 's life include bede 's historia ecclesiastica gentis anglorum ; irish annals , principally the annals of ulster and the annals of tigernach ; and adomnán 's life of saint columba the senchus fer n-alban , a census and genealogy of dál riata , purports to record his ancestry and that of his immediate descendants the surviving irish annals contain elements of a chronicle kept at iona from the middle of the 7th century onwards , so that these too are retrospective when dealing with áedán 's time áedán is exchanged at birth for one of the twin daughters of gabrán , born the same night , so that each family might have a son 89–90 francis john byrne suggested that the echtra was written by a poet at the court of diarmait mac maíl na mbó , an 11th-century descendant of brandub , and was written to cement an alliance between diarmait and the scots king malcolm iii of scotland ( '' malcolm iii '' ) , who claimed to be a descendant of áedán a lost irish tale , echtra áedáin mac gabráin ( the adventures of áedán son of gabrán ) , appears in a list of works , but its contents are unknown the echtra áedáin mac gabráin is listed in áedán is a character in the epic scéla cano meic gartnáin , but the events which inspired the tale appear to have taken place in the middle of the 7th century he may have earned this epithet after the collapse of an alliance with rhydderch hael , king of the nearby brittonic kingdom of alt clut ; enmity between them is remembered in the welsh triads and elsewhere this may point to an otherwise lost tradition concerning one of áedán 's sea expeditions , such as to orkney or the isle of man these were the cenél ngabráin , named for áedán 's father , who ruled over kintyre , cowal and bute ; the cenél loairn of northern argyll ; and the cenél nóengusa of islay looking outward , dál riata 's neighbours in north britain were the picts and the britons of the hen ogledd , the brittonic-speaking parts of what is now northern england and southern lowland scotland adomnán , the senchus fer n-alban and the irish annals record áedán as a son of gabrán mac domangairt ( died c although nothing is known of cuildach and domangart or their descendants , adomnán mentions a certain ioan , son of conall , son of domnall , '' who belonged to the royal lineage of the cenél ngabráin '' , adomnán , ii , 22 but this is generally read as meaning that ioan was a kinsman of the cenél ngabráin , and his grandfather named domnall is not thought to be the same person as áedán 's brother domnall adomnán claims that áedán was ordained as king by columba , the first example of an ordination known in britain and ireland in 574 , following the account of conall 's death , the annals of ulster and the annals of tigernach record a battle in kintyre , called the battle of teloch , or delgu the annals agree that '' dúnchad , son of conall , son of comgall , and many others of the allies of the sons of gabrán , fell sharpe , in the editor 's notes to adomnán 's life , note 204 , proposes a much later date , c áedán and áed agreed that while the fleet of dál riata would serve the uí néill , no tribute would be paid to them , and warriors would only be provided from the dál riata lands in ireland following báetán 's death in 581 , the ulstermen abandoned the isle of man , which they had captured in báetán 's time , perhaps driven out by áedán who is recorded as fighting there c 580 , áedán is said to have raided orkney , which had been subject to bridei i of the picts , king of the picts , at an earlier date áedán 's campaigns on the isle of man have sometimes been confused with the battle against the miathi mentioned by adomnán '' the only recorded battle between áedán and the picts appears to have been fought in circinn , in 599 or after , where áedán was defeated a welsh triad names áedán 's plundering of alt clut as one of the '' three unrestrained plunderings of britain '' , and the poem peiryan vaban tells of a battle between áedán and rhydderch the death of his son domangart in the land of the saxons is mentioned by adomnán , and it is presumed that bran died in the same otherwise unrecorded battle the battle was a decisive victory for æthelfrith , and bede says , carefully , that '' from that day until the present , no king of the irish in britain has dared to do battle with the english the irish poem compert mongáin says that the king of ulster , fiachnae mac báetáin of the dál naraidi , aided áedán against the saxons , perhaps at degsastan 103–104 , notes some textual inconsistencies in the irish sources , and suggests that the '' battle of the saxons '' recorded in the irish annals may not be bede 's '' battle of degsastan '' after the defeat of degsastan , the annals report nothing of áedán until his death around six years later , perhaps on 17 april 609 , the date supplied by the martyrology of tallaght , composed c the prophecy of berchán places his death in kintyre and says '' he will not be king at the time of his death '' , while the 12th century acta sancti lasriani claims that he was expelled from the kingship it has been suggested that gartnait son of áedán could be the same person as gartnait ii , king of the picts , whose death is reported around 601 , but this rests on the idea of pictish matriliny , which has been criticised the names of áedán 's wives are not recorded , but one was said to be brittonic , and another may have been a pictish woman named domelch , if indeed the gartnait son of domelch and gartnait son of áedán are one and the same
