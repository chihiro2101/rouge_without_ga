this is known as '' mithenge '' , a reference to archaeoastronomy and stonehenge ( although the type of alignment bears a closer relationship with that of newgrange and maeshowe in that the sunlight passes through the mass of the buildings rather than through the standing stones of stonehenge ) in 1997 , one student report made the following observations about the informal rules that seem to apply to infinite corridor traffic : the rules of the road for the infinite corridor include : stay to the right , limit group size , pass on the left , form a line at bottlenecks , do n't stop/slow down , no tailgating , traffic within corridor has right of way , no physical contact and no eye contact it is most of a floor above ground level at massachusetts avenue ( the west end , building 7 ) , and in areas is a full floor up , with a parking lot entrance passing underneath ( this entrance crosses the basement-level corridor at grade between buildings 7 and 3 ) on occasion , students in the transport lab of the department of civil and environmental engineering ( cee ) have studied foot traffic in the infinite corridor , as a safer , more accessible model of traffic thumb lobby 7 , so named because of its location in building 7 ( formally named the rogers building ) , is a large vertical space open all the way up to the interior of the little dome university of lethbridge campus map , retrieved 2013-12-08 it is , however , significantly shorter than the so called '' k-stra√üe '' ( k-street ) in the rost-/silberlaube building of the free university of berlin , which measures about the first floor ( called the '' ground floor '' by some ) is the most traveled level , and is often the only one referred to as the infinite corridor a two-story atrium space at the half-way point of the corridor , informally known as lobby 10 , is part of the maclaurin buildings in building 10 , underneath the great dome during the 1960s , a common technology day demonstration used the unobstructed length of the corridor to demonstrate the speed of light in a simple , direct way a carved inscription established for advancement and development of science its application to indvstry the arts agricvlture and commerce charter mdccclxi carved in all capitals without punctuation circles the space just below the base of the little dome , and has been the subject of a hack although in alignment with the corridor during the summertime months , the sunrise can not be observed then , due to visual obstructions at the eastern end of the infinite corridor the corridor is important not only because it links major mit buildings , but also because it serves as the most direct indoor route between the east and west ends of the campus during the 1970s , two large pillars flanking the entrance to the infinite corridor were partially wrapped in paper and used by the liberal '' alternative advertising '' and somewhat less liberal '' pillar productions '' where students would scrawl responses to issues of the day such as nuclear power or whether disco sucks
