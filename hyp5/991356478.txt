to determine the stability of the mass transfer and hence exact fate of the donor star , one needs to take into account how the radius of the donor star and that of its roche lobe react to the mass loss from the donor ; if the star expands faster than its roche lobe or shrinks less rapidly than its roche lobe for a prolonged time , mass transfer will be unstable and the donor star may disintegrate a critical equipotential intersects itself at the lagrangian point of the system , forming a two-lobed figure-of-eight with one of the two stars at the center of each lobe when a star '' exceeds its roche lobe '' , its surface extends out beyond its roche lobe and the material which lies outside the roche lobe can '' fall off '' into the other object 's roche lobe via the first lagrangian point mass transfer due to roche-lobe overflow is responsible for a number of astronomical phenomena , including algol systems , nova ( binary stars consisting of a red giant and a white dwarf that are sufficiently close that material from the red giant dribbles down onto the white dwarf ) , x-ray binary and millisecond pulsars while mass transfer from a more massive donor to a less massive accretor generally leads to a shrinking orbit , the reverse causes the orbit to expand ( under the assumption of mass and angular-momentum conservation ) passing through these two equilibrium points , debris can commute between the external region ( figure-eights of yellow and green in the outer side ) and the communal gravity region of the binary system it is the easiest way for the debris to commute between a hill sphere ( an inner circle of blue and light blue ) and communal gravity regions ( figure-eights of yellow and green in the inner side ) source in a binary system with a circular orbit , it is often useful to describe the system in a coordinate system that rotates along with the objects an alternative division of cases is ba , bb , and bc which are roughly corresponding to rlof phases that happen during helium fusion , after helium fusion but before carbon fusion , or after carbon fusion in the highly evolved star this case can be further subdivided into classes br and bc according to whether the mass transfer occurs from a star dominated by a radiation zone ( br ) and therefore evolves as the situation with most case a rlof or a convective zone ( bc ) after which a common envelope phase may occur ( similar to case c ) image : rochepotential.jpg thumb a three-dimensional representation of the roche potential in a binary star with a mass ratio of 2 , in the co-rotating frame in principle , mass transfer could lead to the total disintegration of the object , since a reduction of the object 's mass causes its roche lobe to shrink
