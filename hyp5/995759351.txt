hill , who developed a series of experimental tailless aircraft designs , collectively known as the westland-hill pterodactyl , during the 1920s and early 1930s junkers conceived futuristic flying wings for up to 1,000 passengers ; the nearest this came to realization was in the 1931 junkers g.38 34-seater grossflugzeug airliner , which featured a large thick-chord wing providing space for fuel , engines , and two passenger cabins with significant breakthrough in materials and construction methods , aircraft such as the bich-3 , '' history of aircraft construction in the ussr '' by v.b in germany , alexander lippisch worked first on tailless types before progressively moving to flying wings , while the horten brothers developed a series of flying wing gliders through the 1930s several other late-war german military designs were based on the flying wing concept , or variations of it , as a proposed solution to extend the range of otherwise very short-range of aircraft powered by early jet engines it combined a flying wing , or nurflügel , design with a pair of junkers jumo 004 jet engines in its second , or '' v2 '' ( v for versuch ) prototype airframe ; as such , it was the world 's first pure flying wing to be powered by twin jet engines , being first reportedly flown in march 1944 in the soviet union , the bich-26 , became one of the first attempts to produce a supersonic jet flying wing aircraft in 1948 ; '' history of aircraft construction in the ussr '' by v.b early proposals for the avro vulcan , a nuclear-armed strategic bomber designed by roy chadwick , also explored several flying wing arrangements ; alliott verdon roe official web site - avro vulcan sketch one such configuration examined for the vulcan paired the flying wing with a rudimentary forward fuselage and a vertical stabilizer at each wingtip ; the delta wing that was actually adopted was arrived at by reducing the wingspan while maintaining the wing area by filling in the space between the wingtips following the arrival of supersonic aircraft during the 1950s , military interest in the flying wing was quickly curtailed , as the concept of adopting a thick wing that accommodated the crew and equipment directly conflicted with the optimal thin wing for supersonic flight a number of companies , including boeing , mcdonnell douglas , and armstrong whitworth , have performed considerable design work on flying wing airliners to date , no such airliners have yet entered production as of 2020 these compromises are difficult to reconcile , and efforts to do so can reduce or even negate the expected advantages of the flying wing design , such as reductions in weight and drag further difficulties arise from the problem of fitting the pilot , engines , flight equipment , and payload all within the depth of the wing section a wing that is made deep enough to contain the pilot , engines , fuel , undercarriage and other necessary equipment will have an increased frontal area , when compared with a conventional wing and long-thin fuselage typically the solution adopted in this case is to keep the wing reasonably thin , and the aircraft is then fitted with an assortment of blisters , pods , nacelles , fins , and so forth to accommodate all the needs of a practical aircraft any fin must attach directly on to the rear part of the wing , giving a small moment arm from the aerodynamic center , which in turn means that the fin is inefficient and to be effective the fin area must be large the problem can be minimized by increasing the wing sweepback and placing twin fins outboard near the tips , as for example in a low-aspect-ratio delta wing , but many flying wings have gentler sweepback and consequently have , at best , marginal stability prandtl , pankonin and others discovered that washout was fundamental to the yaw stability in a turn of the horten brothers flying wings of the 1930s and 1940s the hortens described a '' bell shaped lift distribution '' across the span of the wing , with more lift in the center section and less at the tips due to their reduced angle of incidence , or washing out ; control of a swept wing tailless aircraft through wing morphing , icas 2008 : 26th congress of international council of the aeronautical sciences , paper icas 2008-2.7.1 , pages 1–2 one solution to the control problem is differential drag : the drag near one wing tip is artificially increased , causing the aircraft to yaw in the direction of that wing the supersonic bi-directional flying wing design comprises a long-span low speed wing and a short-span high speed wing joined in the form of an unequal cross zha , im & espinal , toward zero sonic-boom and high efficiency supersonic flight : a novel concept of supersonic bi-directional flying wing nasa has funded a study of the proposal the proposed low-speed wing would have a thick , rounded airfoil able to contain the payload and a long span for high efficiency , while the high-speed wing would have a thin , sharp-edged airfoil and a shorter span for low drag at supersonic speed some types , such as the northrop x-216h , still have a tail stabilizer mounted on tail booms , although they lack a fuselage although sometimes referred to as flying wings , these types carry the pilot ( and engine where fitted ) below the wing structure rather than inside it , and so are not true flying wings an aircraft of sharply swept delta planform and deep center section represents a borderline case between flying wing , blended wing body , and/or lifting body configurations
