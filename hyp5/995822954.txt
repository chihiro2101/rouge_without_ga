however , existing gunnery control systems were inadequate for the purpose ; the range was too far to '' guess '' the lead , but at the same time close enough that the angle could change faster than the gunners could turn the traversal handles inputs to its calculations included wind speed , ballistics of the gun and the rounds it fired , angle to the target in azimuth and altitude , and a user-input estimated target speed however , low-flying aircraft presented a very different problem , with very short engagement times and high angular rates of motion , but at the same time less need for ballistic accuracy some of these inputs were fed in by dials , which turned gearing inside the predictor to calculate the range ( from the change in angle and estimated speed ) and direction of motion machine guns had been the preferred weapon against these targets , aimed by eye and swung by hand , but these no longer had the performance needed to deal with the larger and faster aircraft of the 1930s after a month of limited success against them , every available anti-aircraft gun was moved to the strip of land on the approach to london , and the new sights proved to be more than capable against them the predictor 's plans were passed to sperry corporation , who were just commencing production of their own complex high-altitude system , the m7 computing sight , and had no excess capacity to produce the new design as well the gunners simply kept the gun loaded , while the three aimers simply had to point the predictor , mounted on a large tripod , at the target the kerrison predictor did not calculate fuse settings , as the shells fired by the 40 & nbsp ; mm bofors gun , with which it was designed to work , were contact-fused during testing the kerrison predictor provided accurate fire control to a range in excess of , and the bofors gun was reliable nevertheless , the predictor demonstrated that effective gunnery required some sort of reasonably powerful computing support , and in 1944 bell labs started delivery of a new system based around an electronic analog computer
