askham bog is regarded as one of the most ecologically diverse sites in northern england ; usher mb although the drop in ph and elevational increase on the peat domes is attributable to sphagnum growth , no sphagnum has been found in one vegetation assemblage characterized by honeysuckle and rubus fruticosus within the acid centre of the bog the continued net accumulation of peat in the centre relative to the margins led to a further increase in elevation of the central peat dome , so that supply of base-rich groundwater was prevented completely , therefore rendering the peat centre ombrotrophic therefore , net loss of bases from the peat in the centre of the bog gradually led to increased soil acidity , with loss of the original rich fen community which previously covered the whole area a considerable proportion of this grant was invested in management of askham bog to ensure adequate water quality and level required for the bog wildlife askham bog is rich in invertebrates , and is nationally known for its diversity of water beetles such as haliplidae , noteridae , dytiscidae and gyrinidae a site on the edge of askham bog was earmarked by a developer for a plot of 500 homes there is fossil evidence in the form of hemp achenes and pollen found preserved in distinct horizons between layers of fen peat and scorpidium-sphagnum peat that this plant was once cultivated at askham bog bradshaw rhw , coxon p although exact time spans are unknown , cultivation of hemp at askham was probably intense in the tudor period when the crop was grown and retted extensively and by royal decree in england for hempen ropes for the british navy there is some documentary evidence for this at askham bog in the acomb court roll of 1594 , which restricted where hemp could be retted ( steeped ) owing to the malodour produced by retted fibres and the potential for the retting water to pollute rivers the increased elevation of the central peat mound began to cut off the direct influx of base-rich waters into the bog from the surrounding land and existing bases in the raised peat were leached out through rainfall the earliest evidence of nearby peat cutting from the roman period has been found in a roman well in york in the form of lumps of sphagnum peat askham bog is one of the few northern examples in england to show such an array of habitat transitions consequently , the nutrient-poor , acid surface enabled sphagnum mosses to thrive on the raised bog and contribute greatly to the bulk of peat forming above the fen margins low water tables in the raised area may promote mineralization of phosphate , with low ph counteracting microbial conversion to organic phosphate , so that the resultant high inorganic phosphate component in the raised peat favours growth of this plant community these seeds and pollen are possible relics of retting ( steeping in water ) of hemp because pollen of aquatic plants such as nymphaea and cattails have been found together with hemp seeds and pollen in the same peat cores , therefore suggesting that these hemp remnants were submerged during this period in turn , a layer of fen peat gradually accumulated above the mud in the bog centre to begin forming a raised bog the canopy reduction in the centre of the bog appears to have negatively affected sphagnum growth here probably because of reduced shading and therefore increased desiccation of sphagnum and easier influx of atmospheric pollutants the spider fauna of askham bog , york , and the assessment of conservation value despite nearby potential sources of human disturbance , the bog provides a suitable shelter within a relatively bare surrounding agricultural landscape and has a rich fruit and seed supply in winter and a richness of invertebrates in summer the appeal by the community and yorkshire wildlife trust enlisted the help of sir david attenborough , who said that '' it is our collective responsibility to save it the flora of askham bog is not only diverse , but also distinctly resembles plant assemblies in southern england all migrant warblers have been found at the bog in spring and summer , with the reed beds in the northeast part in near wood comprising an important colony for reed warblers
