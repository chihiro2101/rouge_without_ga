at the time , a number of systems were being proposed that used separate red , green and blue signals ( rgb ) , broadcast in succession color information was then separately encoded and folded into the signal as a high-frequency modification to produce a composite video signal & ndash ; on a black and white television this extra information would be seen as a slight randomization of the image intensity , but the limited resolution of existing sets made this invisible in practice focusing the right signal on each of these tiny spots was beyond the capability of electron guns of the era , and rca 's early experiments used three-tube projectors , or mirror-based systems known as '' triniscope '' stray electrons at the edge of the beam were cut off by the mask , creating a sharply focused spot that was small enough to hit a single colored phosphor on the screen since each of the guns was aimed at the hole from a slightly different angle , the spots of phosphor on the tube could be separated slightly to prevent overlap to ensure there was no overlap of the beam on the screen , the dots had to be separated and covered perhaps 25 % of its surface moreover , the system was highly dependent on the relative angles of the beams between the three guns , which required constant adjustment by the user to ensure the guns hit the correct colors ( blog about this article , ( archived may 4 , 2019 ) in spite of this early start , only a few years after regularly scheduled television broadcasting had begun , consumer uptake of color televisions was very slow to start 43 in 1961 , a sony delegation was visiting the ieee trade show in new york city , including ibuka , akio morita ( sony 's other co-founder ) and nobutoshi kihara , who was promoting his new cv-2000 home video tape recorder they were demonstrating a new type of color television based on the chromatron tube , which used a single electron gun and a vertical grille of electrically charged thin wires instead of a shadow mask in early 1963 , senri miyaoka was sent to manhattan to arrange the transfer of the technology to sony , which would lead to the closing of chromatic labs he also saw general electric 's '' porta-color '' design , using three guns in a row instead of a triangle , which allowed a greater portion of the screen to be lit although this would require the guns to be very carefully aligned with the phosphors on the tube in order to ensure they hit the right colors , with miyaoka 's new tube , this appeared possible in practice , this proved easy to build but difficult to place in the tube & ndash ; the fine wires were mechanically weak and tended to move when the tubes were bumped , resulting in shifting colors on the screen the combination of three-in-one electron gun and the replacement of the shadow mask with the aperture grille resulted in a unique and easily patentable product in spite of trinitron and chromatron having no technology in common , the shared single electron gun has led to many erroneous claims that the two are very similar , or the same officially introduced by ibuka in april 1968 , the original 12 & nbsp ; inch trinitron had a display quality that easily surpassed any commercial set in terms of brightness , color fidelity , and simplicity of operation it was also all solid state , with the exception of the picture tube itself , which allowed it to be much more compact and cool running than designs like ge 's porta-color ibuka cajoled yoshida to take over the effort of bringing the sets into production , and although yoshida was furious at being put in charge of a task he felt was impossible , he finally accepted the assignment and successfully met the production goal the decoder used a 64 microsecond delay line to store every other line , but instead of using the delay line to average out the phase of the current line and the previous line , it simply repeated the same line twice in the mid-1980s , a new phosphor coating was introduced that was much darker than earlier sets , giving the screens a black color when turned off , as opposed to the earlier light grey in 1980 , sony introduced the '' profeel '' line of prosumer component televisions , consisting of a range of trinitron monitors that could be connected to standardized tuners in may 1988 , the high-end 20 & nbsp ; inch ddm model ( data display monitor ) was introduced with a maximum resolution of 2,048 by 2,048 , which went on to be used in the faa 's advanced automation system air traffic control system in april 1981 , they announced the sony hdvs ( hdvs ) , a suite of muse equipment including cameras , recorders , trinitron monitors and projection tvs new uses in the computer field and the demand for higher resolution televisions to match the quality of dvd when it was introduced in 1996 led to increased sales , with another 180 million units delivered in the next decade after the expiration of sony 's trinitron patent , manufacturers like mitsubishi ( whose monitor production is now part of nec display solutions ) were free to use the trinitron design for their own product line without license from sony although they could not use the trinitron name with the introduction of the fd trinitron , sony also introduced a new industrial style , leaving the charcoal colored sets introduced in the 1980s for a new silver styling the fd trinitron was unable to regain the cachet that the trinitron brand had previously possessed ; in the 2004 christmas season , they increased sales by 5 % , but only at the cost of a 75 % plunge in profits after being forced to lower costs to compete in the market at the same time , the introduction of plasma televisions , and then lcd-based ones , led to the high-end market being increasingly focused on the '' thin '' sets both of these technologies have well known problems , and for some time sony explored a wide array of technologies that would improve upon them in the same way the trinitron did on the shadow mask from 2006 , all of sony 's bravia television products are lcd displays , initially based on screens from samsung , and later sharp in 2006 , sony announced that it would no longer market or sell trinitrons in the united states or canada , but it would continue to sell the trinitron in china , india , and regions of south america using tubes delivered from their singapore plant the electrons from the cathodes are all aimed toward a single point at the back of the screen where they hit the aperture grille , a steel sheet with vertical slots cut in it the main purpose of the grille is to ensure that each beam strikes only the phosphor stripes for its color , much as does a shadow mask in comparison to early shadow mask designs , the trinitron grille cuts off much less of the signal coming from the electron guns improvements to the shadow mask designs continually narrowed this difference between the two designs , and by the late 1980s the difference in performance , at least theoretically , was eliminated in the shadow mask design , the size of the holes in the mask is defined by the required resolution of the phosphor dots on the screen , which was constant however , the distance from the guns to the holes changed ; for dots near the center of the screen , the distance was its shortest , at points in the corners it was at its maximum
