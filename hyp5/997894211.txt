around 1930 heinz kilfitt , a trained watchmaker , designed a new 35 & nbsp ; mm film compact camera using a 24×24 & nbsp ; mm frame format ( instead of the leica 24×36 & nbsp ; mm or cine 18×24 & nbsp ; mm formats ) see '' heinz kilfitt - photographic camera , 1936 ( robot camera ) '' on this page for kilfitt 's us patent of '' a photographic camera in which the feed of the film is effected automatically by a spring mechanism '' the camera was originally intended to come in two versions : robot i , without motor , and robot ii with a spring motor the first production cameras had a stainless steel body , a spring drive that could shoot 4 frames per second , and a rotary shutter with speeds from 1 to 1/500th second the camera used proprietary '' type k '' cartridges , not the now-standard 35 & nbsp ; mm cartridges introduced in the same year by kodak 's dr in place of the velvet light trap on modern cassettes , the robot cassette used spring pressure and felt pads to close the film passage when the shutter release is pressed , a light-blocking shield lifts and the shutter disc rotates a full turn exposing the film through its open sector ; when the pressure is released the light-blocking shield returns to its position behind the lens , and the spring motor advances the film and recocks the shutter among the standard lenses were a 3 & nbsp ; cm zeiss tessar and a 3.75 & nbsp ; cm zeiss tessar in f/2.8 and 3.5 variations , a f/2.0 , 40 & nbsp ; mm zeiss biotar and f/4 , 7.5 & nbsp ; cm zeiss sonnar civilian versions of the robot were discontinued at the outset of the second world war , but it was used as a bomb damage assessment camera by the luftwaffe , mounted in the tail of ju87 ( stuka ) dive bombers there are two versions , robot royal 36 , produce 36 24x36mm images on a roll of 135 film , robot royal 24 makes 50 24x24mm images on 135 film robot then introduced the '' junior '' , an economy model with the quality and almost all the features of the '' star '' but without the angle finder or the rewind mechanism in the late 1950s the company , now called robot-berning , redesigned the robot star and created the vollautomat star ii the new higher top housing disposed of the right angle finder and instead included an albada finder with frames for the factory-fitted 38/40 & nbsp ; mm and 75 & nbsp ; mm lenses since most robot cameras by then were sold for industrial use where the camera was fixed in position , robot also introduced versions without a finder , and even without rewind robot-berning also produced enlarged versions of the robot , the robot royal 18 , 24 and 36 , with built-in rangefinder and with an autoburst mode of operation capable of shooting 6 frames per second the robot royal 36 took a standard 35 & nbsp ; mm still picture but was identical to the royal 24 in all other regards it became the centerpiece of the company 's portable document capture , traffic control and security solutions , and continues to be the standard robot camera for instrumentation applications the maximum focal length lens for general photographic use that could be fitted with acceptable vignetting was 75 & nbsp ; mm , although telephotos up to 600 & nbsp ; mm were offered a 150 & nbsp ; mm tele-xenar was available for long-distance action photography , but it produced a vignetted circular image on the 24 × 24 & nbsp ; mm frame the standard 38 & nbsp ; mm f/2.8 xenar lenses were extremely sharp , even by today 's standards , and zone focusing worked well on rapid action with short focal length lenses
