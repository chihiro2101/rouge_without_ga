the parasympathetic division has craniosacral “ outflow ” , meaning that the neurons begin at the cranial nerves ( specifically the oculomotor nerve , facial nerve , glossopharyngeal nerve and vagus nerve ) and sacral ( s2-s4 ) spinal cord there are several locations upon which preganglionic neurons can synapse for their postganglionic neurons : paravertebral ganglia ( 3 ) of the sympathetic chain ( these run on either side of the vertebral bodies ) cervical ganglia ( 3 ) thoracic ganglia ( 12 ) and rostral lumbar ganglia ( 2 or 3 ) caudal lumbar ganglia and sacral ganglia prevertebral ganglia ( celiac ganglion , aorticorenal ganglion , superior mesenteric ganglion , inferior mesenteric ganglion ) chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla ( this is the one exception to the two-neuron pathway rule : the synapse is directly efferent onto the target cell bodies ) these ganglia provide the postganglionic neurons from which innervation of target organs follows examples of splanchnic nerves are : cervical cardiac nerves and thoracic visceral nerves , which synapse in the sympathetic chain thoracic splanchnic nerves ( greater , lesser , least ) , which synapse in the prevertebral ganglia lumbar splanchnic nerves , which synapse in the prevertebral ganglia sacral splanchnic nerves , which synapse in the inferior hypogastric plexus these all contain afferent ( sensory ) nerves as well , known as general visceral afferent fibers the parasympathetic nervous system consists of cells with bodies in one of two locations : the brainstem ( cranial nerves iii , vii , ix , x ) or the sacral spinal cord ( s2 , s3 , s4 ) these are the preganglionic neurons , which synapse with postganglionic neurons in these locations : parasympathetic ganglia of the head : ciliary ( cranial nerve iii ) , submandibular ( cranial nerve vii ) , pterygopalatine ( cranial nerve vii ) , and otic ( cranial nerve ix ) in or near the wall of an organ innervated by the vagus ( cranial nerve x ) or sacral nerves ( s2 , s3 , s4 ) these ganglia provide the postganglionic neurons from which innervations of target organs follows examples are : the postganglionic parasympathetic splanchnic ( visceral ) nerves the vagus nerve , which passes through the thorax and abdominal regions innervating , among other organs , the heart , lungs , liver and stomach the sensory arm is composed of primary visceral sensory neurons found in the peripheral nervous system ( pns ) , in cranial sensory ganglia : the geniculate , petrosal and nodose ganglia , appended respectively to cranial nerves vii , ix and x the nts also receives input from a nearby chemosensory center , the area postrema , that detects toxins in the blood and the cerebrospinal fluid and is essential for chemically induced vomiting or conditional taste aversion ( the memory that ensures that an animal that has been poisoned by a food never touches it again ) preganglionic parasympathetic neurons are found in the medulla oblongata where they form visceral motor nuclei ; the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve ; the nucleus ambiguus , the salivatory nuclei , and in the sacral region of the spinal cord the sympathetic system is often considered the '' fight or flight '' system , while the parasympathetic system is often considered the '' rest and digest '' or '' feed and breed '' system another example is the constant , second-to-second , modulation of heart rate by sympathetic and parasympathetic influences , as a function of the respiratory cycles promotes a fight-or-flight response , corresponds with arousal and energy generation , and inhibits digestion diverts blood flow away from the gastro-intestinal ( gi ) tract and skin via vasoconstriction blood flow to skeletal muscles and the lungs is enhanced ( by as much as 1200 % in the case of skeletal muscles ) dilates bronchioles of the lung through circulating epinephrine , which allows for greater alveolar oxygen exchange increases heart rate and the contractility of cardiac cells ( myocytes ) , thereby providing a mechanism for enhanced blood flow to skeletal muscles dilates pupils and relaxes the ciliary muscle to the lens , allowing more light to enter the eye and enhances far vision provides vasodilation for the coronary vessels of the heart constricts all the intestinal sphincters and the urinary sphincter inhibits peristalsis stimulates orgasm the parasympathetic nervous system has been said to promote a '' rest and digest '' response , promotes calming of the nerves return to regular function , and enhancing digestion constricting the bronchiolar diameter when the need for oxygen has diminished dedicated cardiac branches of the vagus and thoracic accessory nerve nerves impart parasympathetic control of the heart ( myocardium ) constriction of the pupil and contraction of the ciliary muscles , facilitating accommodation and allowing for closer vision stimulating salivary gland secretion , and accelerates peristalsis , mediating digestion of food and , indirectly , the absorption of nutrients sexual at the effector organs , sympathetic ganglionic neurons release noradrenaline ( norepinephrine ) , along with other cotransmitters such as atp , to act on adrenergic receptors , with the exception of the sweat glands and the adrenal medulla : acetylcholine is the preganglionic neurotransmitter for both divisions of the ans , as well as the postganglionic neurotransmitter of parasympathetic neurons
