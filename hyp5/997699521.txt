in 1988 , the national astronomical observatory of japan was formed through a reorganization of the university 's tokyo astronomical observatory , to oversee the jnlt and other large national astronomy projects in 1985 , the astronomy committee of japan 's science council gave top priority to the development of a '' japan national large telescope '' ( jnlt ) , and in 1986 , the university of tokyo signed an agreement with the university of hawaii to build the telescope in hawaii on july 2 , 2011 , the telescope operator in hilo noted an anomaly from the top unit of the telescope upon further examination , coolant from the top unit was found to have leaked over the primary mirror and other parts of the telescope instruments can be mounted at a cassegrain focus below the primary mirror ; at either of two nasmyth focal points in enclosures on the sides of the telescope mount , to which light can be directed with a tertiary mirror ; or at the prime focus in lieu of a secondary mirror , an arrangement rare on large telescopes , to provide a wide field of view suited to deep wide-field surveys for example , 261 computer-controlled actuators press the main mirror from underneath , which corrects for primary mirror distortion caused by changes in the telescope orientation in september 1999 , princess sayako of japan dedicated the telescope in 1984 , the university of tokyo formed an engineering working group to develop and study the concept of a telescope the telescope enclosure building is also shaped to improve the quality of astronomical images by minimizing the effects caused by atmospheric turbulence
