as a result of semi-official suggestions , based on official disapproval of his supposedly liberal views , he decided , in 1822 , to leave berlin , and accepted a professorship at the gymnasium in saarbrücken in 1836 he became an extraordinary professor of philosophy at the university of bonn , and in 1840 full professor dissatisfied with the reactionary tendencies of the prussian ministry of education , he accepted a call to the chair of philosophy at the university of tübingen in 1842 where he continued to give lectures on all philosophic subjects until his retirement in 1875 when he moved to stuttgart this journal served as an organ of fichte 's views , especially on the subject of the philosophy of religion , where he was in alliance with c weisse ( with whom he regularly corresponded after 1829 ) ; anatol schneider , personalität und wirklichkeit : nachidealistische schellingrezeption bei immanuel hermann fichte und christian hermann weisse , königshausen & neumann , 2001 , pp but , whereas weisse thought that the hegelian structure was sound in the main , and its imperfections might be mended , fichte held it to be defective , and spoke of it as a masterpiece of erroneous consistency or consistent error fichte 's general views on philosophy seem to have changed considerably as he gained in years , and his influence has been impaired by certain inconsistencies and an appearance of eclecticism , which is strengthened by his predominantly historical treatment of systems , his desire to include divergent systems within his own , and his conciliatory tone the great aim of his speculations was to find a philosophic basis for the personality of god , and for his theory on this subject he proposed the term '' concrete theism '' immanuel hermann fichte entry at the internet encyclopedia of philosophy fichte advocates an ethical theism , and his arguments might be turned to account by the apologist of christianity the same reason that made him depreciate hegel made him praise krause ( panentheism ) and schleiermacher , and speak respectfully of english philosophy it is characteristic of fichte 's most excessive receptiveness that in his latest published work , der neuere spiritualismus ( 1878 ) , he supports his position by arguments of a somewhat occult or theosophical cast , not unlike that adopted by f the regeneration of christianity , according to fichte , would consist in its becoming the vital and organizing power in the state , instead of being occupied solely , as heretofore , with the salvation of individuals ( 1902 ) this work cites the same sources as the 1911 encyclopædia britannica 's and in addition : erdmann , j
