a circuit is a non-empty trail in which the first vertex is equal to the last vertex ( closed trail ) a cycle or simple circuit is a circuit in which the only repeated vertex is the first/last vertex a directed circuit is a non-empty directed trail in which the first vertex is equal to the last vertex a directed cycle or simple directed circuit is a directed circuit in which the only repeated vertex is the first/last vertex a chordless cycle in a graph , also called a hole or an induced cycle , is a cycle such that no two vertices of the cycle are connected by an edge that does not itself belong to the cycle a peripheral cycle is a cycle in a graph with the property that every two edges not on the cycle can be connected by a path whose interior vertices avoid the cycle in his 1736 paper on the seven bridges of k√∂nigsberg , widely considered to be the birth of graph theory , leonhard euler proved that , for a finite undirected graph to have a closed walk that visits each edge exactly once , it is necessary and sufficient that it be connected except for isolated vertices ( that is , all edges are contained in one component ) and have even degree at each vertex the corresponding characterization for the existence of a closed walk visiting each edge exactly once in a directed graph is that the graph be strongly connected and have equal numbers of incoming and outgoing edges at each vertex cactus graph , a graph in which every nontrivial biconnected component is a cycle cycle graph , a graph that consists of a single cycle chordal graph , a graph in which every induced cycle is a triangle directed acyclic graph , a directed graph with no cycles line perfect graph , a graph in which every odd cycle is a triangle perfect graph , a graph with no induced cycles or their complements of odd length greater than three pseudoforest , a graph in which each connected component has at most one cycle strangulated graph , a graph in which every peripheral cycle is a triangle strongly connected graph , a directed graph in which every edge is part of a cycle triangle-free graph , a graph without three-vertex cycles
