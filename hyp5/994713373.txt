releasing the izumo1r/juno gpi protein from the egg plasma membrane does not allow for sperm to fuse with the egg and it is suggested that this mechanism may contribute to the polyspermy block at the plasma membrane in eggs an example in which palmitoylation of a protein plays a role in cell signaling pathways is in the clustering of proteins in the synapse it is believed that this reverse palmitoylation may regulate the interaction of the protein with the membrane and thus have a role in signaling processes more specifically , these isoprenoid groups , usually farnesyl ( 15-carbon ) and geranylgeranyl ( 20-carbon ) are attached to the protein via thioether linkages at cysteine residues near the c terminal of the protein after the protein bh3 interacting-domain death agonist ( bid ) has been myristoylated , it targets the protein to move to the mitochondrial membrane to release cytochrome c , which then ultimately leads to cell death the fatty acid chains of the phosphatidylinositol are inserted into the membrane and thus are what anchor the protein to the membrane the most common fatty acids that are covalently attached to the protein are the saturated myristic ( 14-carbon ) acid and palmitic acid ( 16-carbon ) this gpi complex consists of several main components that are all interconnected : a phosphoethanolamine , a linear tetrasaccharide ( composed of three mannose and a glucosaminyl ) and a phosphatidylinositol in the caax box sequence , the c represents the cysteine that is prenylated , the a represents any aliphatic amino acid and the x determines the type of prenylation that will occur if the x is an ala , met , ser or gln the protein will be farnesylated via the farnesyltransferase enzyme and if the x is a leu then the protein will be geranylgeranylated via the geranylgeranyltransferase i enzyme this dynamic interaction of prenylated proteins with the cell membrane is important for their signalling functions and is often deregulated in disease processes such as cancer
