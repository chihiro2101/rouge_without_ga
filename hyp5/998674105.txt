although , fundamentally , both western and japanese primatology share many of the same principles , the areas of their focus in primate research and their methods of obtaining data differ widely additionally , this interface is of particular interest to the science watchers in science and technology studies , who examine the social conditions which incite , mould , and eventually react to scientific discoveries and knowledge long-term sites of research tend to be best associated with their founders , and this led to some tension between younger primatologists and the veterans in the field as a science , primatology has many different sub-disciplines which vary in terms of theoretical and methodological approaches to the subject used in researching extant primates and their extinct ancestors there are three methodological approaches in primatology : field study , the more realistic approach ; laboratory study , the more controlled approach ; and semi-free ranging , where primate habitat and wild social structure is replicated in a captive setting linda fedigan views herself as a reporter or translator , working at the intersection between gender studies of science and the mainstream study of primatology where sociobiology attempts to understand the actions of all animal species within the context of advantageous and disadvantageous behaviors , primatology takes an exclusive look at the order primates , which includes homo sapiens the japanese discipline of primatology tends to be more interested in the social aspects of primates in particular , the use of primatological studies to assert gender roles , and to both promote and subvert feminism has been a point of contention field study is done in natural environments , in which scientific observers watch primates in their natural habitat ) the meeting point of these two disciplines has become a nexus of discussion on key issues concerning the evolution of sociality , the development and purpose of language and deceit , and the development and propagation of culture this research is highly indicative of the ability of chimps to detect the folk psychological state of '' desire '' , as well as the ability to recognize that other individuals are better at certain tasks than they are the interface between primatology and sociobiology examines in detail the evolution of primate behavioral processes , and what studying our closest living primate relatives can tell about our own minds early primate study focused primarily on medical research , but some scientists also conducted '' civilizing '' experiments on chimpanzees in order to gauge both primate intelligence and the limits of their brainpower the study of primatology looks at the biological and psychological aspects of non-human primates the size of the neocortex in a primate 's brain correlates directly to the number of individuals it can keep track of socially , be it a troop of chimps or a tribe of humans japanese primatologists are renowned for their ability to recognise animals by sight , and indeed most primates in a research group are usually named and numbered primate behavior , like human behavior , is highly social and ripe with the intrigue of kingmaker , powerplays , deception , cuckoldry , and apology scientific studies concerning primate and human behavior have been subject to the same set of political and social complications , or biases , as every other scientific discipline the study of primates is a group effort , and the group will get the credit for it such facilities include the living links center at the yerkes national primate research center in georgia , us and the elgin center at lion country safari in florida , us in semi-free ranging studies , scientists are able to watch how primates might act in the wild but have easier access to them , and the ability to control their environments before darwin , and before molecular biology , the father of modern taxonomy , carl linnaeus , organized natural objects into kinds , that we now know reflect their evolutionary relatedness this is a strategy that is incompatible with observational field studies , and weakens them in the eyes of hard science the conceptualization of both human infants and primate adults is cross-sensory , meaning that they can add 15 red dots to 20 beeps and approximate the answer to be 35 grey squares theory of mind asks whether or not an individual recognizes and can keep track of information asymmetry amongst individuals in the group , and whether or not they can attribute folk psychology to their peers while some influential women challenged fundamental paradigms , schiebinger suggests that science is constituted by numerous factors varying from gender roles and domestic issues that surround race and class to economic relations between researchers from developed world countries and the developing world countries in which most nonhuman primates reside the evolution of vocal communication solves both the time constraint and the one-on-one problem , but at a price this is not to say that the japanese study of primatology is cruel – far from it – just that it does not feel that their subjects should be given reverential treatment one of them is the discussion of the politics of participation and the attention placed on females as subjects of research each member of the primate community has a part to play , and the japanese researchers are interested in this complex interaction a team of researchers may observe a group of primates for several years in order to gather very detailed demographic and social histories if the mind is a general computer , for instance , the ability to use reasoning should be identical regardless of the context although social grooming is observed in many animal species , the grooming activities undertaken by primates are not strictly for the elimination of parasites the borderline and multidisciplinary nature of primatology and sociobiology make them ripe fields of study because they are amalgams of objective and subjective sciences though kawai is the only japanese primatologist associated with the use of this term , the underlying principle is part of the foundation of japanese primate research
