the sequential unfolding of modules is observed as a very characteristic sawtooth pattern of the force vs elongation graph ; every tooth corresponds to the unfolding of a single protein module ( apart from the last that is generally the detachment of the protein molecule from the tip ) in the ideal case of a single sharp energy barrier for the tip-sample interactions the dynamic force spectrum will show a linear increase of the rupture force as function of a logarithm of the loading rate , as described by a model proposed by bell et al if some force is acting on the elastic cantilever ( for example because some molecule is being stretched between the surface and the tip ) , this will deflect upward ( repulsive force ) or downward ( attractive force ) in all of these techniques , a biomolecule , such as protein or dna , or some other biopolymer has one end bound to a surface and the other to a force sensor when the restoring force of the cantilever exceeds tip-sample adhesion force the probe jumps out of contact , and the magnitude of this jump is often used as a measure of adhesion force or rupture force typically , the force curves observed in the force spectroscopy experiments consist of a contact ( diagonal ) region where the probe contacts the sample surface , and a non-contact region where the probe is off the sample surface biomolecules , such as dna , rna or proteins , can be individually tethered between the microspheres and a surface and then probed by the acoustic forces exerted by the piezo sensor in some cases , binding between the two partners will occur , which will become visible in the force curve , as the use of a flexible linker gives rise to a characteristic curve shape ( see worm-like chain model ) distinct from adhesion in biophysics , single-molecule force spectroscopy can be used to study the energy landscape underlying the interaction between two bio-molecules , like proteins moreover , force spectroscopy can be used to investigate the enzymatic activity of proteins involved in dna replication , transcription , organization and repair a recently developed technique , acoustic force spectroscopy ( afs ) , allows the force manipulation of hundreds of single-molecules and single-cells in parallel , providing high experimental throughput another technique that has been gaining ground for single molecule experiments is the use of optical tweezers for applying mechanical forces on molecules recently this technique has been used in cell biology to measure the aggregative stochastic forces created by motor proteins that influence the motion of particles within the cytoplasm
