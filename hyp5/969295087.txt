in 1488 , henry vii decreed that non-clergymen should be allowed to plead the benefit of clergy only once : those pleading the benefit of clergy , but not able to prove through documentation of their holy orders that they actually were clergymen , were branded on the thumb , and the brand disqualified them from pleading the benefit of clergy in the future whereas before , the benefit was pleaded before a trial to have the case transferred to an ecclesiastical court , under the new system the benefit of clergy was pleaded after conviction but before sentencing , and it did not nullify the conviction , but rather changed the sentence for first-time offenders from probable hanging to branding and up to a year 's incarceration the benefit of clergy was commonly applied as a means of judicial mercy : in elizabethan england , courts might allow more than 90 % of clergyable offenders the benefit of clergy , which is extremely high in light of the literacy rate of the period thus , an illiterate person who had memorized the appropriate psalm could also claim the benefit of clergy , and psalm 51:1 became known as the '' neck verse '' because knowing it could save one 's neck by transferring one 's case from a secular court , where hanging was a likely sentence , to an ecclesiastical court , where both the methods of trial and the sentences given were more lenient in the new world of the british colonies , the two soldiers convicted of manslaughter in the 1770 boston massacre were spared execution for manslaughter under the benefit of clergy , but underwent branding of their right thumbs to prevent them from invoking the right in any future murder case ( see tudor reforms below ) as a result of this leniency in the ecclesiastical courts , a number of reforms were undertaken to combat the abuse of the benefit of clergy benefit of clergy , boston massacre unofficially , the loophole was even larger , because the biblical passage traditionally used for the literacy test was , appropriately , the first verse of psalm 51 ( psalm 50 according to the vulgate and septuagint numbering ) , miserere mei , deus , secundum misericordiam tuam ( '' o god , have mercy upon me , according to thine heartfelt mercifulness '' ) a person convicted by an ecclesiastical court could be defrocked and returned to the secular authorities for punishment ; but the english ecclesiastical courts became increasingly lenient , and , by the 15th century , most convictions in these courts led to a sentence of penance benefit of clergy was abolished in the united kingdom of great britain and ireland by two acts in 1823 , and parliament formally abolished benefit of clergy with the criminal law act 1827 by this point , benefit of clergy had been transformed from a privilege of ecclesiastical jurisdiction to a mechanism by which first-time offenders could obtain partial clemency for some crimes this restriction was condemned by pope leo x at the fifth lateran council in 1514 , and the resulting controversy ( in which both the john fineux and the william warham became involved ) was one of the issues that would lead to henry viii splitting the church of england from the catholic church in 1532
