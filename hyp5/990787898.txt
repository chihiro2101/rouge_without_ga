in 1975 , the ieee standardized the bus as standard digital interface for programmable instrumentation , ieee & nbsp ; 488 ; it was revised in 1978 ( producing ieee & nbsp ; 488-1978 ) it became known as the general purpose interface bus ( gpib ) , and became a de facto standard for automated and industrial instrument control the iec developed their own standards in parallel with the ieee , with iec & nbsp ; 60625-1 and iec & nbsp ; 60625-2 ( iec & nbsp ; 625 ) , later replaced by iec & nbsp ; 60488 in 2004 , the ieee and iec combined their respective standards into a '' dual logo '' ieee/iec standard iec & nbsp ; 60488-1 , standard for higher performance protocol for the standard digital interface for programmable instrumentation - part 1 : general , replaces ieee & nbsp ; 488.1/iec & nbsp ; 60625-1 , and iec & nbsp ; 60488-2 , part 2 : codes , formats , protocols and common commands , replaces ieee & nbsp ; 488.2/iec & nbsp ; 60625-2 & nbsp ; iii the standard was revised in 1987 , and redesignated as ieee & nbsp ; 488.1 ( ieee & nbsp ; 488.1-1987 ) some of hp 's advanced pocket calculators of the 1980s , such as the hp-41 and hp-71b series , also had ieee & nbsp ; 488 capabilities , via an optional hp-il/hp-ib interface module while ieee & nbsp ; 488.1 defined the hardware and ieee & nbsp ; 488.2 defined the protocol , there was still no standard for instrument-specific commands reverse-engineered schematics for commodore c64 ieee interface several third party suppliers of commodore 64 peripherals made a cartridge for the c64 that provided an ieee & nbsp ; 488-derived interface on a card edge connector similar to that of the pet series the commodore pet ( introduced 1977 ) range of personal computers connected their peripherals using the ieee & nbsp ; 488 bus , but with a non-standard card edge connector ieee & nbsp ; 488 is an 8-bit , electrically parallel bus which employs sixteen signal lines — eight used for bi-directional data transfer , three for handshake , and five for bus management — plus eight ground return lines the iec & nbsp ; 60625 standard prescribes the use of 25-pin d-subminiature connectors ( the same as used for the parallel port on ibm pc compatibles ) ieee & nbsp ; 488.2 provided for basic syntax and format conventions , as well as device-independent commands , data structures , error protocols , and the like scpi mandated the ieee & nbsp ; 488.2 syntax , but allowed other ( non-ieee & nbsp ; 488.1 ) physical transports hp 's designers did not specifically plan for ieee & nbsp ; 488 to be a peripheral interface for general-purpose computers ; the focus was on instrumentation one unusual feature of ieee & nbsp ; 488 connectors is they commonly use a '' double-headed '' design , with male on one side , and female on the other in 1987 , ieee introduced standard codes , formats , protocols , and common commands , ieee & nbsp ; 488.2 they developed the hp interface bus ( hp-ib ) to enable easier interconnection between instruments and controllers ( computers and other instruments )
