the white-rumped vulture is a typical , medium-sized vulture , with an unfeathered head and neck , very broad wings , and short tail feathers it is the smallest of the gyps vultures , but is still a very large bird this vulture builds its nest on tall trees often near human habitations in northern and central india , pakistan , nepal , bangladesh and southeast asia , laying one egg like other vultures it is a scavenger , feeding mostly on carcasses , which it finds by soaring high in thermals and spotting other scavengers at one time , it was the most numerous vulture in india within the well-supported clade of the genus gyps which includes asian , african , and european populations , it has been determined that this species is basal with the other species being more recent in their species divergence allan octavian hume observed '' hundreds of nests '' and noted that white-rumped vultures used to nest on large trees near habitations even when there were convenient cliffs in the vicinity ticks , argas ( persicargas ) abdussalami , have been collected in numbers from the roost trees of these vultures in pakistan the white-rumped vulture was originally very common especially in the gangetic plains of india , and often seen nesting on the avenue trees within large cities in the region hugh whistler noted for instance in his guide to the birds of india that it “ is the commonest of all the vultures of india , and must be familiar to those who have visited the towers of silence in bombay jerdon noted that “ this is the most common vulture of india , and is found in immense numbers all over the country , at calcutta one may frequently be seen seated on the bloated corpse of some hindoo floating up or down with the tide , its wing spread , to assist in steadying it this species , as well as the indian vulture and slender-billed vulture has suffered a 99 % population decrease in india and nearby countries since the early 1990s the decline has been widely attributed to poisoning by diclofenac , which is used as veterinary non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( nsaid ) , leaving traces in cattle carcasses which when fed on leads to kidney failure in birds an alternate hypothesis is an epidemic of avian malaria , as implicated in the extinctions of birds in the hawaiian islands affected vultures were initially reported to adopt a drooped neck posture and this was considered a symptom of pesticide poisoning , but subsequent studies suggested that this may be a thermoregulatory response as the posture was seen mainly during hot weather in southeast asia , the near-total disappearance of white-rumped vultures predated the present diclofenac crisis , and probably resulted from the collapse of large wild ungulate populations and improved management of dead livestock , resulting in a lack of available carcasses for vultures it has been suggested that the use of meloxicam ( another nsaid ) as a veterinary substitute that is safer for vultures would help in the recovery
