as a result of the astrographic congress of more than 50 astronomers held in paris in april 1887 , 20 observatories from around the world agreed to participate in the project , and two goals were established : for the first , the astrographic catalogue , the entire sky was to be photographed to 11 & nbsp ; mag to provide a reference catalogue of star positions that would fill the magnitude gap between those previously observed by transit and meridian circle instrument observations down to 8 & nbsp ; mag & ndash ; this would provide the positions of a reasonably dense network of star positions which could in turn be used as a reference system for the fainter survey component ( the carte du ciel ) for the astrographic catalogue , 20 observatories from around the world participated in exposing and measuring more than 22,000 glass plates ( see table ) the stars from the hipparcos catalogue were used to establish a detailed reference framework at the various epochs of the astrographic catalogue plates , while the 2.5 million stars in the tycho-2 catalogue provided a dense reference framework to allow the plate distortions to be accurately calibrated and corrected aside from the 120,000 stars of the hipparcos catalogue itself , the resulting tycho-2 catalogue ( compiled at the copenhagen university observatory under the leadership of erik høg ) is now the largest , most accurate and most complete , star catalogue of the brightest stars on the sky the plate measurements ( as rectangular coordinates ) , as well as the formulae to transform them to equatorial coordinates , were published in the original volumes of the astrographic catalogue , although the accompanying equatorial coordinates are now of only historical interest turner , 1912 the great star map , being a brief general account of the international project known as the astrographic chart ( john murray ) other aspects are covered in various papers in the proceedings of iau symposium number & nbsp ; 133 held in 1988 the first such plate was taken in august 1891 at the vatican observatory ( where the exposures took more than 27 & nbsp ; years to complete ) , and the last in december 1950 at the ukkel observatory ( brussels ) , with most observations being made between 1895 and 1920 henry chamberlain russell for further details of the australian contribution iau commission 8 working group , includes a photograph of nuns measuring the vatican plate collection ( 1910–1921 ) histoire de l'observatoire de toulouse ( with a section on the carte du ciel ) a compilation of historical material by the palermo observatory these plates were to be reproduced and distributed as a set of charts , the carte du ciel , in contrast to previous sky charts which had been constructed from the celestial coordinates of stars observed by transit instruments the vast amount of work invested in the astrographic catalogue , taking plates , measuring , and publishing , looked for a long time as giving only a marginal scientific profit they yielded a catalogue of positions and magnitudes down to about 11.5 & nbsp ; mag , and the programme was largely completed during the first quarter of the 20th century
