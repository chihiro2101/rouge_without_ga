in a simple substitution cipher , each letter of the plaintext is replaced with another , and any particular letter in the plaintext will always be transformed into the same letter in the ciphertext for instance , if all occurrences of the letter turn into the letter , a ciphertext message containing numerous instances of the letter would suggest to a cryptanalyst that represents more s in the ciphertext than anything else suggests that corresponds to in the plaintext , but this is not certain ; and are also very common in english , so might be either of them also more complex use of statistics can be conceived , such as considering counts of pairs of letters ( bigrams ) , triplets ( trigrams ) , and so on this is done to provide more information to the cryptanalyst , for instance , and nearly always occur together in that order in english , even though itself is rare suppose eve has intercepted the cryptogram below , and it is known to be encrypted using a simple substitution cipher as follows : for this example , uppercase letters are used to denote ciphertext , lowercase letters are used to denote plaintext ( or guesses at such ) , and ~ is used to express a guess that ciphertext letter represents the plaintext letter eve could use frequency analysis to help solve the message along the following lines : counts of the letters in the cryptogram show that is the most common single letter , most common bigram , and is the most common trigram is the most common letter in the english language , is the most common bigram , and is the most common trigram the second most common letter in the cryptogram is ; since the first and second most frequent letters in the english language , and are accounted for , eve guesses that ~ , the third most frequent letter filling in these guesses , eve gets : in turn , these guesses suggest still others ( for example , '' '' could be '' '' , implying ~ and so on , and it is relatively straightforward to deduce the rest of the letters , eventually yielding the plaintext the first known recorded explanation of frequency analysis ( indeed , of any kind of cryptanalysis ) was given in the 9th century by al-kindi , an arab polymath , in a manuscript on deciphering cryptographic messages polyalphabetic cipher , that is , the use of several alphabets & mdash ; chosen in assorted , more or less devious , ways ( leone alberti seems to have been the first to propose this ) ; and polygraphic substitution , schemes where pairs or triplets of plaintext letters are treated as units for substitution , rather than single letters , for example , the playfair cipher invented by charles wheatstone in the mid-19th century
