in 1222 , berengaria intervened anew in favor of her son , achieving the ratification of the convention of zafra , thereby making peace with the laras by arranging the marriage of mafalda , daughter and heiress of the lord of molina , gonzalo pérez de lara , to her own son and king ferdinand 's brother , alfonso as the eldest child of king alfonso and eleanor —who preferred to give birth to a son and therefore later king— , she was the heiress presumptive of the throne of castile for several years because many of the children born later to the couple died shortly after birth or in early infancy , and so berengaria became a greatly desired bride throughout europe at the end of may the situation in castile had grown perilous for berengaria , so she decided to take refuge in the castle of autillo de campos , which was held by gonzalo rodríguez girón ( one of her allies ) and sent her son ferdinand to the court of his father in order to help secure peace between castile and león and by becoming a mediator between her father and her husband , berengaria married alfonso ix of león , her first cousin once removed , in valladolid in 1197 in 1224 she arranged the marriage of her daughter berengaria to john of brienne , a maneuver which brought ferdinand iii closer to the throne of león , since john was the candidate alfonso ix had in mind to marry his eldest daughter sancha in 1214 , on the death of her father , alfonso viii of castile , the crown passed to his only surviving son , berengaria 's 10-year-old brother , henry i one example was how she arranged the marriage of her son with princess elisabeth of hohenstaufen ( known as beatriz in castile ) , daughter of duke philip of swabia and granddaughter of two emperors : frederick barbarossa and isaac ii angelos of byzantium perhaps her most decisive intervention on ferdinand 's behalf took place in 1230 , when alfonso ix died and designated as heirs to the throne his daughters sancha and dulce from his first marriage to theresa of portugal , superseding the rights of ferdinand iii though she had left her role as queen of león , she retained authority over and taxing rights in many of the lands she had received there , including salamanca and castroverde , which she gave to her son ferdinand in 1206 berengaria 's status as heir of castile when she inherited the throne was based in part on documentation in the treaty and marriage contract , which specified that she would inherit the kingdom after her father or any childless brothers who may come along another instance in which berengaria 's mediation stood out developed in 1218 when the scheming lara family , still headed by former regent álvaro núñez de lara , conspired to have alfonso ix , king of león and king ferdinand 's father , invade castile to seize his son 's throne he married , first , mafalda de lara , heiress of molina and mesa , second , teresa núñez , and third , mayor téllez de meneses , lady of montealegre and tiedra , by whom he was the father of maría of molina , wife of king sancho iv of castile by 1191 , berengaria requested an annulment of the engagement from the pope , influenced , no doubt , by third parties such as her grandmother eleanor of aquitaine , who was not interested in having a hohenstaufen as a neighbor to her french fiefdoms however , the capture of count lara facilitated the intervention of berengaria , who got father and son to sign the pact of toro on 26 august 1218 , putting an end to confrontations between castile and león berengaria 's first engagement was agreed in 1187 when her hand was sought by conrad , the fifth child of holy roman emperor frederick i barbarossa berengaria met with the princesses ' mother and succeeded in the ratification of the treaty of las tercerías , by which they renounced the throne in favor of their half-brother in exchange for a substantial sum of money and other benefits
