one region contained larger and more luminous stars of spectral types a to m and received the name giant just as the agb stars occur in almost the same region of the hr diagram as red supergiants , wolf–rayet stars can occur in the same region of the hr diagram as the hottest blue supergiants and main-sequence stars the most massive and luminous main-sequence stars are almost indistinguishable from the supergiants they quickly evolve into they have almost identical temperatures and very similar luminosities , and only the most detailed analyses can distinguish the spectral features that show they have evolved away from the narrow early o-type main-sequence to the nearby area of early o-type supergiants such early o-type supergiants share many features with wnlh wolf–rayet stars and are sometimes designated as slash stars , intermediates between the two types luminous blue variables ( lbvs ) stars occur in the same region of the hr diagram as blue supergiants but are generally classified separately they are evolved , expanded , massive and luminous stars like supergiants , but at the most massive and luminous extreme , and with particular additional properties of undergoing high mass-loss due to their extreme luminosities and instability the latter has become more common with the understanding that the be phenomenon arises separately in a number of distinct types of stars , including some that are clearly just a phase in the life of supergiants supergiants have masses from 8 to 12 times the sun upwards , and luminosity from about 1,000 to over a million times the sun radiation pressure limits the largest cool supergiants to around 1,500 and the most massive hot supergiants to around a million ( m bol around & minus ; 10 ) there are supergiant stars at all of the main spectral classes and across the whole range of temperatures from mid-m class stars at around 3,400 k to the hottest o class stars over 40,000 k the relative numbers of blue , yellow , and red supergiants is an indicator of the speed of stellar evolution and is used as a powerful test of models of the evolution of massive stars all supergiants are larger and more luminous than main sequence stars of the same temperature a b0 main sequence star has an absolute magnitude of about & minus ; 5 , meaning that all b0 supergiants are significantly brighter than absolute magnitude & minus ; 5 the very hottest supergiants with early o spectral types occur in an extremely narrow range of luminosities above the highly luminous early o main sequence and giant stars the most luminous yellow stars , the yellow hypergiants , are amongst the visually brightest stars , with absolute magnitudes around & minus ; 9 , although still less than the majority of red supergiants were main sequence stars and now have luminosities below , and there are very few bright supergiant ( ia ) m class stars the least luminous stars classified as red supergiants are some of the brightest agb and post-agb stars , highly expanded and unstable low mass stars such as the rv tauri variables the same region of instability extends to include the even more luminous yellow hypergiants , an extremely rare and short-lived class of luminous supergiant rv tau stars are frequently assigned spectral types with a supergiant luminosity class on account of their low surface gravity , and they are amongst the most luminous of the agb and post-agb stars , having masses similar to the sun ; likewise , the even rarer pv tel variables are often classified as supergiants , but have lower luminosities than supergiants and peculiar be spectra extremely deficient in hydrogen the abundance of various elements at the surface of supergiants is different from less luminous stars supergiants are evolved stars and may have undergone convection of fusion products to the surface cool supergiants show enhanced helium and nitrogen at the surface due to convection of these fusion products to the surface during the main sequence of very massive stars , to dredge-ups during shell burning , and to the loss of the outer layers of the star post-red supergiant stars have a generally higher level of nitrogen relative to carbon due to convection of cno-processed material to the surface and the complete loss of the outer layers o type main-sequence stars and the most massive of the b type blue-white stars become supergiants they continue to fuse hydrogen until it is almost entirely depleted throughout the star , then rapidly evolve through a series of stages of similarly hot and luminous stars : supergiants , slash stars , wnh- , wn- , and possibly wc- or wo-type stars the first stars in the universe are thought to have been considerably brighter and more massive than the stars in the modern universe rigel , the brightest star in the constellation orion is a typical blue-white supergiant ; deneb is the brightest star in cygnus , a white supergiant ; delta cephei is the famous prototype cepheid variable , a yellow supergiant ; and betelgeuse , antares and uy scuti are red supergiants μ cephei is one of the reddest stars visible to the naked eye and one of the largest in the galaxy
