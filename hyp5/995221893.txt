in 1994 , atmel purchased the eerom assets of seeq technology ( lsi corporation acquired the rest of seeq in 1999 ) in 1995 , atmel was among the first companies to license the arm architecture , creating initially its at91 family of devices , followed by the sam family , and more recently a full selection of cortex-based solutions , including ones based on the ultra-low-power arm cortex-m4 in 1995 , atmel acquired the pan-european chipmaker european silicon structures ( es2 ) and thus gained a fabrication facility in rousset , france atmel formed a design team in trondheim , norway to develop the atmel avr line of risc microcontrollers in 1998 , atmel purchased part of temic from vishay intertechnology , which provided them with a fab in germany as well as part of mhs from vishay that gave them a fab in nantes , france in september 2000 , atmel acquired a fabrication plant in north tyneside , england , from siemens , via a Â£28 million grant from the uk government and paying siemens around us 35 million '' grading the chain : atmel ceo steven laub '' atmel announced the sale of its north tyneside facility ( fab9 ) on october 8 , 2007 in february 2011 , atmel sold its digital research in electronics , acoustics and music ( dream ) business , which sold products for karaoke and other entertainment machines , for us 2.3 million one strategy was to participate in the touch screen market , both in the semiconductor chips and the sensors themselves '' atmel completes acquisition of quantum research group '' work done at quantum , led to the 2012 release of atmel 's xsense product line , a flexible touch screen based on copper mesh electrodes ozmo was founded in 2004 as h-stream wireless by kateljin vleugels and roel peeters , and was based in palo alto , california however , in 2016 , microchip agreed to buy atmel for 3.6 billion these include the avr 8- and 32-bit microcontrollers , arm architecture microprocessors , and arm-based flash microcontrollers to provide for the internet of things ( iot ) , atmel offers dual-band 2.4 & nbsp ; ghz/5 & nbsp ; ghz a/b/g wi-fi chips from its ozmo acquisition also , atmel makes wireless transceivers using regional 700/800/900 & nbsp ; mhz , as well as global 2.4 & nbsp ; ghz frequency bands , some chips are standalone transceivers while others are integrated with a microcontroller atmel also makes remote control rf products using the license-free ism band ( industrial scientific medical ) frequencies ( 5.8 & nbsp ; ghz , 2.4 & nbsp ; ghz , 868 to 928 & nbsp ; mhz , 433 & nbsp ; mhz , and 315 & nbsp ; mhz ) atmel also makes simple touch controller chips for buttons , sliders , and wheels used on industrial and consumer products these ics are used in many applications , including secure access , communications , control , and to prevent cloned products like batteries or ink cartridges not approved by the product manufacturer the company also makes power management and analog companions ( pmaac ) that combine a group of discrete ics often used in handheld or battery-powered products products include fpgas , products with military and aerospace applications , and application-specific standard products ( assp ) for space applications , power management , and secure cryptographic memory products these products include car access , touch control , radio , can , van , and lin bus networking , battery management , high-temperature drivers , and serial eeproms image : mck glamor 320.jpg thumb right the make controller kit with an atmel at91sam7x256 ( arm ) microcontroller atmel avr , a family of 8-bit microcontrollers atmel arm-based processors , a family of arm-based microcontrollers avr32 , family of 32-bit microcontrollers at91cap , 32-bit arm + gate array dataflash , serial interface flash memory arduino , open hardware single-board prototyping platform using an avr microcontroller atmega88 , 8-bit microcontroller atmega see also avr instruction set atmel at89 series , 8-bit microcontrollers , compatible with intel 8051
