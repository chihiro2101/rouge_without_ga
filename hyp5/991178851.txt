but in contrast to descartes , who considered it possible to form a clear and distinct idea of the mind , malebranche argues in the dialogues on metaphysics , a dialogue between theodore and aristes , that we do not have a complete conception of the powers of the mind , and thus no clear conception of the nature of the mind changes occurring in created things will exhibit regularities ( and will thus satisfy a humean definition of causation ) because god in creating the world observes what malebranche calls '' order '' : he binds himself to act according to laws of nature chosen in accordance with his general will that the world be as good as possible , and thus ( for example ) that the laws be simple and few in number i , '' sketch of a history of the doctrine of the ideal and the real '' locke withheld his '' an examination of père malebranche 's opinion of seeing all things in god '' from publication , '' because he looked upon it to be an opinion that would not spread but was like to die of itself , or at least to do no great harm malebranche was born in paris in 1638 , the youngest child of nicolas malebranche , secretary to king louis xiii of france , and catherine de lauzon , sister of jean de lauson , a governor of new france gottfried leibniz ( who met malebranche in paris in about 1675 and corresponded with him thereafter ) also rejected the vision in god , and his theory of pre-established harmony was designed as a new alternative to occasionalism as well as to the more traditional theory of efficient causal interaction he was , however , held in widespread high regard within his own lifetime and for some time afterwards , and the influence of certain of his ideas can be discerned in the works of several important figures ( this may be a misrepresentation of malebranche 's view ; see the first chapter of the search for truth , where he specifies that while we can not but desire the good in general , we are free to apply that love to particulars , and can do so in a disordered fashion that leads to sin ( 2 ) if all things are under the direct control of god , subject to his will , what of human freedom ? malebranche 's view that we have freedom to choose but only in relation to finite goods is not convincing , denying as it does the possibility of resistance of movement towards god as the universal good malebranche replied in a short preface added to that second volume , and then , in the 1678 third edition , he added 50 % to the already considerable size of the book with a sequence of ( eventually ) seventeen elucidations in others , malebranche placed a greater emphasis than he had previously done on his occasionalist account of causation , and particularly on his contention that god acted for the most part through '' general volitions '' and only rarely , as in the case of miracles , through '' particular volitions '' in which is treated the nature of the human mind and the use that must be made of it to avoid error in the sciences , the book laid the foundation for malebranche ’ s philosophical reputation and ideas thus , god produces the natural evils that follow from simple laws not because he wills those particular effects , but because he wills a world that best reflects his wisdom by achieving the best possible balance between the intrinsic perfection of the work and the simplicity and generality of its laws here , he made it explicit that the generality of the laws whereby god regulated his behaviour extended not only to his activity in the natural world but also applied to his gift of grace to human beings in the tenth elucidation , for instance , malebranche introduced his theory of '' intelligible extension '' , a single , archetypal idea of extension into which the ideas of all particular kinds of bodies could be jointly resolved however , in his own theodicy , even if it was somewhat more elaborate than malebranche 's , he did at least agree with malebranche 's fundamental contention that the simplicity of god 's ways had to be given as much regard as the world 's perfection he is noted particularly for his view that we see all things in god and for his adoption of psycho-physical parallelism and 'occasionalism ' to deal with the problem of interaction between mind and body ) ( 3 ) in so far as god is not to be identified with the archetypal eternal truths in his mind , malebranche is not a pantheist there , he devoted himself to ecclesiastical history , linguistics , the bible , and the works of saint augustine in 1699 , he delivered an address to the académie royale des sciences on the nature of light and color , wherein he argued that different colors resulted out of different frequencies in the pressure vibrations of subtle matter , much as different musical tones derived from different frequencies in the vibrations of air he left home at the age of sixteen to pursue a course of philosophy at the collège de la marche , and subsequently to study theology at the collège de sorbonne , both colleges from the university of paris however , when it came to finding a positive replacement for such causal connections , he turned inwards to the workings of the human mind , instead of turning upwards to god whereas malebranche followed augustine in his description of intellectual knowledge , in his approach to mind–body problems he began as a follower of descartes he also wrote on mathematics and , although he made no major mathematical discoveries of his own , he was instrumental in introducing and disseminating the contributions of descartes and leibniz in france in the dialogues on metaphysics and religion ( dialogue 1 ) , malebranche added that the same basic structure can also account for ( the mental as opposed to the physiological element in ) imagination , in this case where the idea only '' lightly touches '' the mind the inner sensation which i have of myself informs me that i am , that i think , that i will , that i have sensory awareness , that i suffer , and so on ; but it provides me with no knowledge whatever of what i am – of the nature of my thought , my sensations , my passions , or my pain – or of the mutual relations that obtain between all these things newton had already developed his position some thirty years earlier , but malebranche probably would not have been aware of it until it was finally published in the opticks of 1704 , or , more likely , in its latin translation of 1706 when i will that my arm should rise , my volition is the '' occasion '' or the '' occasional cause '' of the movement of my arm ; the efficient cause of both my volition and the movement of my arm is god when malebranche revised his 1699 paper for inclusion as the sixteenth elucidation of the 1712 edition of the search after truth , he inserted a number of references to '' newton 's excellent work '' aside , perhaps , from john norris ( who , in any case , drew at least as much from malebranche 's own sources , primarily saint augustine , as he did from malebranche himself ) , there are few if any philosophers who can be considered faithful followers of malebranche in all matters the thomas taylor translation of the search ( 1694 ; second edition 1700 ) includes material not contained in the lennon and olscamp edition ( which is based on the 1712 version of the text ) malebranche defined '' truth '' as a relation between ideas : since these ideas are in god , they are eternal and immutable , and consequently the only truths worthy of the name will themselves be eternal and immutable ethics , for malebranche , are therefore divine in their foundation , universal in their application , and to be discovered by intellectual contemplation , just as geometrical principles are de mairan was sympathetic to the views of baruch spinoza , and felt that he had found similar views in his reading of malebranche : malebranche assiduously resisted such an association in addition , berkeley agreed with malebranche , against descartes , that we could not achieve a clear idea of the mind itself
