it consists of two sections , divided by a junction which connects it to the grand union canal the northern section from kings norton in the suburbs of birmingham to lapworth is level for the first , following the birmingham level , but then descends quite rapidly through the lapworth flight of 18 locks , to reach the junction there is a choice of route to reach the grand union , as there are two locks side by side , one on the main line of the canal , and one on the branch , but a channel joins the bottom ends of both locks it is long , and like many canal tunnels it has no towpath ; horses were walked over the hill and barges were pulled through the tunnel using a handrail on the wall of the tunnel , parts of which can still be seen the stratford-upon-avon canal was conceived as part of a network of canals which would allow coal from the dudley canal and the stourbridge canal to reach oxford and london , without having to use the birmingham canals , the management of which was seen as high-handed an act was passed on 28 march 1793 for the construction of a canal from a junction with the worcester and birmingham canal in kings norton to stratford-upon-avon negotiations started with the warwick and birmingham , and to second act was obtained on 19 may 1795 , to allow a connecting link to be built , despite rather unfavourable terms imposed on through traffic by the other company the dudley canal extension through the lapal tunnel was opened in early 1798 , and with progress being made on the warwick and birmingham canal , the company obtained a third act of parliament on 21 june 1799 , which allowed it to raise more money , and included a diversion of the route further to the east near lapworth , so that the length of the connecting link to the warwick and birmingham was only about james , who had owned shares in the company since 1793 , had a wide interest in turnpike roads and railways , and following a tour of the north of england between 1802 and 1804 , on which he investigated railways and canals , he expanded his business interests to include coal mining he wanted to create a through route between the river severn and the midlands , and so the canal company obtained a further act of parliament on 12 may 1815 , which authorised a connection between the canal and the avon at stratford , as well as enabling them to build reservoirs at earlswood for a while the upper river was managed by a syndicate of seven people , all connected with the canal , and the canal company took out a lease of it from 1842 for five years in 1845 , the company agreed to sell the canal to the oxford , worcester and wolverhampton railway , who were also keen to purchase the stratford and moreton tramway 2 , the tunnel lane lift bridge at lifford , became faulty , and was replaced by the gwr with a fixed bridge which left insufficient height for a boat to pass after lord methuen raised the issue in the house of lords in 1947 , and was assured that the bridge '' would be lifted at any time on notice of intended passage being given '' , tom rolt of the inland waterways association ( iwa ) announced that he intended to pass under the bridge on 20 may 1947 by the 1950s , the southern section was un-navigable by canal boats , as several of the locks could not be operated , and some of the small pounds between the locks of the wilmcote flight were dry retention of the canal was announced on 22 may 1959 , and by 16 october , the british transport commission and the national trust reported that they had agreed on the terms of a lease , under which the national trust would be responsible for the restoration and maintenance of the southern section the project was managed by david hutchings , who pioneered the use of voluntary labour , which would be used on many subsequent restorations , and assistance was also given by prisoners from winson green prison , the army and the raf airfield construction branch ten years after the re-opening , the queen mother performed the same ceremony for the upper avon navigation , which had been derelict for more than a century , and the canal became part of a through route to the river severn once more the canal was transferred on 1 april 1988 , authorised by an order of the secretary of state , which provided Â£1.5 million , phased over five years , to enable the canal to be brought up to standard
