in the summer of 1792 charles dumouriez , the french foreign minister and commander of the armée du nord , had believed that the best way to prevent an austrian and prussian invasion of france was to invade the austrian netherlands , but the allies had launched their invasion before dumouriez was ready to move , and he had been forced to move south the allied invasion had been at valmy on 20 september where the french army stood up to an artillery bombardment , and proved that it would not flee at the first sign of opposition the allied commander , the duke of brunswick , was not willing to risk a full-scale assault on the french line , and withdrew after it his original plan for a three-pronged invasion had to be changed , as the promised resources to achieve it proved unavailable , and instead , at the end of october , he concentrated most of his men in front of valenciennes and marched towards mons , and the way to brussels the austrian army was commanded by duke albert of saxe-teschen , the governor of the austrian netherlands the austrian right was commanded by franz freiherr von lilien , the center by franz sebastian de croix , count of clerfayt and the left by johann peter freiherr von beaulieu his own armée du nord contained 32,000 infantry , 3,800 cavalry and 100 guns and was supported in jemappes by a further 4,000 men and 15 guns under general françois harville the most obvious example was the commander of the french center , the duke of chartres , who had assumed the name of general egalite , and would later become king louis-philippe of france the austrians had suffered 818 casualties , and lost another 423 men taken prisoner , while france had a higher casualty rate and had failed to prevent the escape of a much smaller army to defend a position of danger however , in the context of the situation in 1792 , with the french army in chaos due to exile of many of its experienced officers , it was a great success the victory at jemappes , achieved by inexperienced volunteers over the austrian regulars , greatly increased the confidence of the revolutionary government in paris , and encouraged their tendency to aggressive warfare this first french occupation of belgium would be short-lived , but in the few months that the revolutionaries managed to alienate the population , imposing their ideas of freedom on a conservative population in 1793 dumouriez was forced to flee into exile , but his victory at jemappes was an important step in the direction of the military triumphs of the french republic
