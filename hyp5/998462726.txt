the recognition from these groups encourages local officials to carry out their official tasks as they value high moral standing in the group political corruption refers to '' the misuse or the abuse of public office for private gains '' , where corrupt practices include fraud , appropriation of public funds , or accepting bribes are some examples of corrupt practices moreover , in high-corrupt contexts , voters may become more tolerant or even prefer corrupt politicians because others are also perceived as corrupt , leading to a corrupt equilibrium '' where voters are generally willing to retain corrupt politicians '' , which is referred to as a '' political corruption trap '' the high corruption equilibrium is difficult to break due to the interaction between corrupt politicians , voters who tolerate and retain corrupt politicians , and potential entrants or challengers who are also apt to engage in corrupt practices , leading to the maintenance of corruption furthermore , so far , the only agreement in the literature is that freedom of the press contributes to the reduction of corruption , by exposing these actions nevertheless , information about corruption may not only lead to vote losses for the incumbent parties , but also for the challenger parties , as well to the erosion of partisan attachments , which implies that information about corruption also provokes citizens ' disengagement from the political process on the other hand , there is evidence that points out to the fact that , despite strategic evasion and unintentional consequences , anticorruption initiatives are beneficial , as they allow to lower malfeasance and increases social welfare , even where strategic evasion is relatively large within an organization , the principles and practices of ethical accountability aim to improve both the internal standard of individual and group conduct as well as external factors , such as sustainable economic and ecologic strategies here it is suggested that researcher accountability implies that researchers are cognizant of , and take some responsibility for , the potential impact of their ways of doing research – and of writing it up – on the social fields of which the research is part that is , accountability is linked to considering carefully , and being open to challenge in relation to , one 's choices concerning how research agendas are framed and the styles in which write-ups of research '' results '' are created because many different individuals in large organizations contribute in many ways to the decisions and policies , it is difficult even in principle to identify who should be accountable for the results '' responsibility for failures of government : the problem of many hands , '' american review of public administration 44 ( 3 ) : 259–273 accountability is an element of a raci to indicate who is ultimately answerable for the correct and thorough completion of the deliverable or task , and the one who delegates the work to those responsible legal scholar anne davies , for instance , argues that the line between public institutions and private entities like corporations is becoming blurred in certain areas of public service in the united kingdom , and that this can compromise political accountability in those areas with respect to the public/private overlap in the united states , public concern over the contracting of government services ( including military ) and the resulting accountability gap has been highlighted recently following the shooting incident involving the blackwater security firm in iraq as defined by national council on measurement in education ( ncme ) , accountability is '' a program , often legislated , that attributes the responsibility for student learning to teachers , school administrators , and/or students '' in contrast , some educational establishments such as sudbury schools believe that students are personally responsible for their acts , and that traditional schools do not permit students to choose their course of action fully ; they do not permit students to embark on the course , once chosen ; and they do not permit students to suffer the consequences of the course , once taken they adduce that the essential ingredient for acquiring values—and for moral action is personal responsibility , that schools will become involved in the teaching of morals when they become communities of people who fully respect each other 's right to make choices , and that the only way the schools can become meaningful purveyors of ethical values is if they provide students and adults with real-life experiences that are bearers of moral import data were drawn from an extensive set of field notes made in an ethnographic study at sudbury valley school ( an ungraded , democratically structured school in framingham , ma ) , where students , ranging in age from 4 to 19 , are free to choose their own activities and companions an analysis of the evolution of mass media in the us and europe since world war ii noted mixed results from the growth of the internet : '' the digital revolution has been good for freedom of expression and information but has had mixed effects on freedom of the press '' : it has disrupted traditional sources of funding , and new forms of internet journalism have replaced only a tiny fraction of what 's been lost however , governments may engage in electoral manipulation not only to obtain victory at a given election or to remain longer in office , but also for post-election reasons such as reducing the strength of the opposition and increasing their own bargaining power in the subsequent period a standard for humanitarian organizations to help them '' design , implement , assess , improve and recognize accountable programmes '' webpage : in addition , some non-profit organizations set up their own commitments to accountability : accountability , learning and planning system ( alps ) by actionaid , a framework that sets out the key accountability requirements , guidelines , and processes '' responsibility for failures of government : the problem of many hands , '' american review of public administration 44:3 ( 2014 ) , 259–273 '' the responsibility of advisers '' in restoring responsibility : ethics in government , business and healthcare ( cambridge university press , 2005 ) , pp mark bovens , '' two concepts of accountability : accountability as a virtue and as a mechanism , '' west european politics 33 ( 2010 ) , 946–967 dennis thompson , '' the responsibility of advisers '' in restoring responsibility : ethics in government , business and healthcare ( cambridge university press , 2005 ) , pp painter-morland mollie , ghislain deslandes , ( 2015 ) , '' authentic leading as relational accountability : facing up to the conflicting expectations of media leaders '' , leadership , online available 2 april , doi:1742715015578307
