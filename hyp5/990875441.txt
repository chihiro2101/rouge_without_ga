fields that employ the concept of taphonomy include : archaeobotany archaeology biology forensic science geoarchaeology geology paleoecology paleontology zooarchaeology there are five main stages of taphonomy : disarticulation , dispersal , accumulation , fossilization , and mechanical alteration the first stage , disarticulation , occurs as the organism decays and the bones are no longer held together by the flesh and tendons of the organism '' changes '' begin as soon as the death of the organism : enzymes are released that destroy the organic contents of the tissues , and mineralised tissues such as bone , enamel and dentin are a mixture of organic and mineral components moreover , most often the organism ( vegetal or animal ) is dead because it has been '' killed '' by a predator covered within this field is the dominance of biological versus physical agents in the destruction of remains from all major taxonomic groups ( plants , invertebrates , vertebrates ) the outlines of megabiases in the fossil record , including the evolution of new bauplans and behavioral capabilities , and by broad-scale changes in climate , tectonics , and geochemistry of earth surface systems fossils are ubiquitous in sedimentary rocks , yet paleontologys can not draw the most accurate conclusions about the lives and ecology of the fossilized organisms without knowing about the processes involved in their fossilization for example , if a fossil assemblage contains more of one type of fossil than another , one can infer either that the organism was present in greater numbers , or that its remains were more resistant to decomposition during the late twentieth century , taphonomic data began to be applied to other paleontological subfields such as paleobiology , paleoceanography , ichnology ( the study of trace fossils ) and biostratigraphy by coming to understand the oceanographic and ethology implications of observed taphonomic patterns , paleontologists have been able to provide new and meaningful interpretations and correlations that would have otherwise remained obscure in the fossil record this includes soil disturbances and tool marks from digging the grave , disruption of plant growth and soil ph from the decomposing body , and the alteration of the land and water drainage from introducing an unnatural mass to the area this field is extremely important because it helps scientists use the taphonomic profile to help determine what happened to the remains at the time of death ( perimortem ) and after death ( postmortem ) fernandez jalvo , yolanda and peter andrews , “ methods in taphonomy ” in atlas of taphonomic identifications : 1001+ images of fossil and recent mammal bone modification , ed it is thus arguably the most important goal of taphonomy to identify the scope of such biases such that they can be quantified to allow correct interpretations of the relative abundances of organisms that make up a fossil biota a deposit could be ripped up and redeposited elsewhere , meaning that a deposit may contain a large number of fossils from another place ( an allochthonous deposit , as opposed to the usual autochthonous ) thus , a question that is often asked of fossil deposits is to what extent does the fossil deposit record the true biota that originally lived there ? many fossils are obviously autochthonous , such as rooted fossils like crinoids , and many fossils are intrinsically obviously allochthonous , such as the presence of photoautotrophic plankton in a benthic deposit that must have sunk to be deposited species not endemic to that area ) when the sedimentology is dominated by gravity-driven surges , such as mudslides , or may become biased if there are very few endemic organisms to be preserved the degree varies on many factors , such as tissue type , the habitat , the frequency of burial events and exhumation events , and the depth of bioturbation within the sedimentary column relative to net sediment accumulation rates a related problem is the slow changes that occur in the depositional environment of an area ; a deposit may experience periods of poor preservation due to , for example , a lack of biomineralizing elements major shifts in intrinsic and extrinsic properties of organisms , including morphology and behaviour in relation to other organisms or shifts in the global environment , can cause secular or long-term cyclic changes in preservation ( megabias ) much of the incompleteness of the fossil record is due to the fact that only a small amount of rock is ever exposed at the surface of the earth , and not even most of that has been explored such tissues include wood ( lignin ) , spores and pollen ( sporopollenin ) , the cuticles of plants ( cutan ) and animals , the cell walls of algae ( algaenan ) , and potentially the polysaccharide layer of some lichens after being subjected to heat and pressure , these cross-linked organic molecules typically '' cook '' and become kerogen or short ( other factors affect the likelihood of preservation ; for instance scleritisation renders the jaws of polychaetes more readily preserved than the chemically equivalent but non-sclerotised body cuticle anoxia does , however , reduce the probability that scavengers will disturb the dead organism , and the activity of other organisms is undoubtedly one of the leading causes of soft-tissue destruction from the time of death or burial until excavation , taphonomy can aid in the understanding of past environments
