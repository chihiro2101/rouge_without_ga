it is also important to note that the two fifths , three minor thirds , and three major sixths marked in orange in the tables ( ratio 40/27 , 32/27 , and 27/16 ( or g− , e♭− , and a+ ) , even though they do not completely meet the conditions to be wolf intervals , deviate from the corresponding pure ratio by an amount ( 1 syntonic comma , i.e in quarter-comma meantone , the fifth is of size , about 3.42157 cents ( or exactly one twelfth of a diesis ) flatter than 700 cents , and so the wolf is about 737.637 cents , or 35.682 cents sharper than a perfect fifth of size exactly 3:2 , and this is the original howling wolf fifth for example , the isomorphic keyboard in figure 2 has 19 buttons per octave , so the above-cited edge condition , from e to c , is not a wolf interval in 12-tet , 17-tet , or 19-tet ; however , it is a wolf interval in 26-tet , 31-tet , and 53-tet in pythagorean tuning , there are eleven justly tuned fifths sharper than 700 cents by about 1.955 cents ( or exactly one twelfth of a pythagorean comma ) , and hence one fifth will be flatter by twelve times that , which is 23.460 cents ( one pythagorean comma ) flatter than a just fifth this is also true for any perfect fourth or perfect fifth which slightly deviates from the perfectly consonant 4:3 or 3:2 ratios ( for instance , those tuned using 12-tone equal or quarter-comma meantone temperament ) when the perfect fifth is tempered to be exactly 700 cents wide ( that is , tempered by approximately of a syntonic comma , or exactly of a pythagorean comma ) then the tuning is identical to the familiar 12-tone equal temperament with a more extreme meantone temperament , like 19 equal temperament , the wolf is large enough that it is closer in size to a sixth than a fifth , and sounds like a different interval altogether rather than a mistuned fifth if eleven of them have a value of 700 & nbsp ; − & nbsp ; ε cents , as in quarter-comma meantone and most other meantone temperament tuning systems , the other fifth ( more properly called a diminished sixth ) will equal 700 & nbsp ; + & nbsp ; 11ε cents in terms of frequency ratios , the product of the fifths must be 128 , and if f is the size of a fifth , 128 : f 11 , or f 11 :128 , will be the size of the wolf the note that is a tempered perfect fifth higher than e is b , which is not included on the keyboard shown ( although it could be included in a larger keyboard , placed just to the right of a , hence maintaining the keyboard 's consistent note-pattern ) the very intrepid may simply want to treat it as a xenharmonic music interval ; depending on the size of the meantone fifth it can be made to be exactly 20:13 or 17:11 , or less commonly to 32:21 or 49:32 conversely , the expressions imperfect fourth and imperfect fifth do not conflict with the standard naming convention when they refer to a dissonant augmented third or diminished sixth ( e.g for example , the wicki keyboard shown in figure 1 is generated by the same musical intervals as the syntonic temperament — that is , by the octave and tempered perfect fifth — so they are isomorphic
