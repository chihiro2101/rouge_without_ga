it has also been called persea ( '' perseus 's wife '' ) or cepheis ( '' cepheus 's daughter '' ) , all names that refer to andromeda 's role in the greco-roman myth of perseus , in which cassiopeia , the queen of ethiopia , bragged that her daughter was more beautiful than the nereids , sea nymphs blessed with incredible beauty m32 , visible with a far smaller size of 8.7 by 6.4 arcminutes , compared to m110 , appears superimposed on the larger galaxy in a telescopic view as a hazy smudge , m110 also appears slightly larger and distinct from the larger galaxy ; m32 is 0.5° south of the core , m32 is 1° northwest of the core she was chained to a rock by the sea but was saved by the hero perseus , who in one version of the story used the head of medusa to turn the monster into stone ; in another version , by the roman poet ovid in his metamorphoses , perseus slew the monster with his diamond sword ι and is a blue-white hued main-sequence star of type b8 , 502 light-years from earth ; κ and is a white-hued main-sequence star of type b9 ivn , 168 light-years from earth ; λ and is a yellow-hued giant star of type g8 , 86 light-years from earth ; ο and is a blue-white hued giant star of type b6 , 679 light-years from earth ; and ψ and is a blue-white hued main-sequence star of type b7 , 988 light-years from earth it is an enormous & nbsp ; – 192.4 by 62.2 arcminutes in apparent size & nbsp ; – barred spiral galaxy similar in form to the milky way and at an approximate magnitude of 3.5 , is one of the brightest deep-sky objects in the northern sky the andromedids were associated with the most spectacular meteor showers of the 19th century ; the storms of 1872 and 1885 were estimated to have a peak rate of two meteors per second ( a zenithal hourly rate of 10,000 ) , prompting one chinese astronomer to compare the meteors to falling rain in traditional chinese astronomy , nine stars from andromeda ( including beta andromedae , mu andromedae , and nu andromedae ) , along with seven stars from pisces , formed an elliptical constellation called '' legs '' ( 奎宿 ) for the chinese , the northern swath of andromeda formed a stable for changing horses , 天厩 , stable on sky ) and the far western part , along with most of lacerta , became tengshe , a flying snake the most famous deep-sky object in andromeda is the spiral galaxy cataloged as messier 31 ( m31 ) or ngc 224 but known colloquially as the andromeda galaxy for the constellation british astronomer william herschel said of the star : '' the striking difference in the colour of the two stars , suggests the idea of a sun and its planet , to which the contrast of their unequal size contributes not a little along with the andromeda galaxy and its companions , the constellation also features ngc 891 ( caldwell 23 ) , a smaller galaxy just east of almach the andromeda galaxy 's two main companions , m32 and m110 ( also known as ngc 221 and ngc 205 , respectively ) are faint elliptical galaxies that lie near it the other open cluster in andromeda is ngc 7686 , which has a similar magnitude of 5.6 and is also a part of the milky way ν and , μ and , β and , η and , ζ and , ε and , δ and , π and , and 32 and were all included from andromeda ; ν psc , φ psc , χ psc , and ψ psc were included from pisces the stars that make up pisces and the middle portion of modern andromeda formed a constellation representing a fertility goddess , sometimes named as anunitum or the lady of the heavens because of its distance in the sky from the band of obscuring dust , gas , and abundant stars of our home galaxy , andromeda 's borders contain many visible distant galaxies m31 is one of the most distant objects visible to the naked eye , 2.2 & nbsp ; million light-years from earth ( estimates range up to 2.5 million light-years ) it is far fainter than m31 and m32 , but larger than m32 with a surface brightness of 13.2 , magnitude of 8.9 , and size of 21.9 by 10.9 arcminutes the arabic names are a reference to the fact that α and forms an asterism known as the '' great square of pegasus '' with three stars in pegasus : α , β , and γ peg an arab constellation called '' al-hut '' ( the fish ) was composed of several stars in andromeda , m31 , and several stars in pisces andromeda was one of the original 48 constellations formulated by ptolemy in his 2nd-century almagest , in which it was defined as a specific pattern of stars the uranography of andromeda has its roots most firmly in the greek tradition , though a female figure in andromeda 's location had appeared earlier in babylonian astronomy as such , the star was formerly considered to belong to both andromeda and pegasus , and was co-designated as '' delta pegasi ( δ peg ) '' , although this name is no longer formally used '' the secondary , described by herschel as a '' fine light sky-blue , inclining to green '' , is itself a double star , with a secondary of magnitude 6.3 and a period of 61 years it is a loosely scattered cluster in the milky way that measures 49 arcminutes across and features approximately twelve bright stars , although more than 60 stars of approximately 9th magnitude become visible at low magnifications in a telescope it represents andromeda 's head in western mythology , however , the star 's traditional arabic names & nbsp ; – alpheratz and sirrah , from the phrase surrat al-faras & nbsp ; – sometimes translated as '' navel of the steed '' it earned its popular name because it appears as a faint , round , blue-green object in a telescope , with an overall magnitude of 9.2 however , β and was mostly considered by the arabs to be a part of al-hut , a constellation representing a larger fish than pisces at andromeda 's feet
