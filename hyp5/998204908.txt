longships were naval vessels made and used by the vikings from scandinavia and iceland for trade , commerce , exploration , and warfare during the viking age many stone engravings from the nordic stone age and in particular the nordic bronze age , depict ships in various situations and valuable ships were sacrificed as part of ceremonial votive offerings since at least the nordic iron age , as evidenced by the hjortspring and nydam mose this is shorter than the gokstad type of longships , but knarrs are sturdier by design and they depended mostly on sail-power , only putting oars to use as auxiliaries if there was no wind on the open water the best-preserved viking age knarr is the äskekärr ship , which was found in sweden in 1933 , and is believed to be from about 930 ad the viking kingdoms developed into coastal towns and forts , all of which were deeply dependent on the north sea and the baltic sea for survival and development the longship 's design evolved over many years , beginning in the stone age with the invention of the umiak and continuing up to the 9th century with the nydam and kvalsund ships the average speed of viking ships varied from ship to ship but lay in the range of 5–10 knots , and the maximum speed of a longship under favorable conditions was around 15 knots the ship has been functioning as the centerpiece of scandinavian culture for millennia , serving both pragmatic and religious purposes , and its importance was already deeply rooted in the scandinavian culture when the viking age began the design of the knarr later influenced the design of the cog , used in the baltic sea by the hanseatic league longships were also double-ended , the symmetrical bow and stern allowing the ship to reverse direction quickly without having to turn around ; this trait proved particularly useful in northern latitudes where icebergs and sea ice posed hazards to navigation ship burial is an ancient tradition in scandinavia , stretching back to at least the nordic iron age , as evidenced by the hjortspring boat ( 400–300 bc ) or the nydam mose ( 200–450 ad ) , for example on the other hand , some academics have proposed that the vikings also developed more advanced aids to navigation , such as the use of a sun compass the stone changes to a certain color , based on the direction of the waves , but only when the object is held in an area with direct sunlight furthermore , during the early viking age , oar ports replaced rowlocks , allowing oars to be stored while the ship was at sail and to provide better angles for rowing a ship 's hull could be as thin as one inch ( 2.5 & nbsp ; cm ) , as a split plank is stronger than a sawed plank found in later craft because of their overwhelming importance , ships became a mainstay of the viking religion , as they evolved into symbols of power and prowess furthermore , the hedeby coins , among the earliest known danish currency , have impressions of ships as emblems , showing the importance of naval vessels in the area a faering is an open rowboat with two pairs of oars , commonly found in most boat-building traditions in western and northern scandinavia , dating back to the viking age however , further investigation of the object revealed that the slits inscribed in the disc are disproportionately spaced , and so the object could not in fact function as an accurate compass
