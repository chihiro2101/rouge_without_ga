in the late 1960s , the neutral theory of molecular evolution provided a theoretical basis for the molecular clock , though both the clock and the neutral theory were controversial , since most evolutionary biologists held strongly to panselectionism , with natural selection as the only important cause of evolutionary change since the pioneering work of sol spiegelmann in 1967 ref , involving rna that replicates itself with the aid of an enzyme extracted from the qß virus ref , several groups ( such as kramers ref and biebricher/luce/eigen ref ) studied mini and micro variants of this rna in the 1970s and 1980s that replicate on the timescale of seconds to a minute , allowing hundreds of generations with large population sizes ( e.g the chemical kinetic elucidation of the detailed mechanism of replication ref , ref meant that this type of system was the first molecular evolution system that could be fully characterised on the basis of physical chemical kinetics , later allowing the first models of the genotype to phenotype map based on sequence dependent rna folding and refolding to be produced ref , ref coli long-term evolution experiment evolutionary physiology evolution of dietary antioxidants genomic organization genetic drift genome evolution heterotachy history of molecular evolution horizontal gene transfer human evolution molecular clock molecular paleontology neutral theory of molecular evolution nucleotide diversity parsimony population genetics selection experiments with in vitro rna quasi species included the characterisation of the error threshold for information in molecular evolution ref , the discovery of de novo evolution ref leading to diverse replicating rna species and the discovery of spatial travelling waves as ideal molecular evolution reactors ref , ref these studies were accompanied by theoretical developments and simulations involving rna folding and replication kinetics that elucidated the importance of the correlation structure between distance in sequence space and fitness changes ref , including the role of neutral networks and structural ensembles in evolutionary optimisation the principles of population genetics apply similarly to all types of selection , though in fact each may produce distinct effects due to clustering of genes with different functions in different parts of the genome , or due to different properties of genes in particular functional classes the history of molecular evolution starts in the early 20th century with comparative biochemistry , and the use of '' fingerprinting '' methods such as immune assays , gel electrophoresis and paper chromatography in the 1950s to explore homologous proteins research in molecular evolution is also published in journals of genetics , molecular biology , genomics , systematics , and evolutionary biology the content and structure of a genome is the product of the molecular and population genetic forces which act upon that genome protein evolution is inescapably tied to changes and selection of dna polymorphisms and mutations because protein sequences change in response to alterations in the dna sequence at the end of the 1960s , two groups of scientists—kimura ( 1968 ) and king and jukes ( 1969 ) —independently proposed that a majority of the evolutionary changes observed in proteins were neutral hence , there is higher probability of genetic modifications , in regions such as prophages , which is proportional to the probability of de novo formation of genes the society for molecular biology and evolution publishes the journals '' molecular biology and evolution '' and '' genome biology and evolution '' and holds an annual international meeting the field of molecular evolution came into its own in the 1960s and 1970s , following the rise of molecular biology among these mutations , some will be neutral or beneficial and will remain in the genome unless lost via genetic drift , and others will be detrimental and will be eliminated from the genome by natural selection the content and distribution of genes within the genome can influence the rate at which certain types of mutations occur and can influence the subsequent evolution of different species later experiments employed novel combinations of enzymes to elucidate novel aspects of interacting molecular evolution involving population dependent fitness , including work with artificially designed molecular predator prey and cooperative systems of multiple rna and dna ref , ref after the 1970s , nucleic acid sequencing allowed molecular evolution to reach beyond proteins to highly conserved ribosomal rna sequences , the foundation of a reconceptualization of the early history of life principles of molecular evolution have also been discovered , and others elucidated and tested using experimentation involving amplification , variation and selection of rapidly proliferating and genetically varying molecular species outside cells artificial selection , also known as selective breeding , is imposed by an outside entity , typically humans , in order to increase the frequency of desired traits subject to maintaining the function of the multicomponent qß enzyme , chemical conditions could be varied significantly , in order to study the influence of changing environments and selection pressures ref molecular systematics has been made possible by the availability of techniques for dna sequencing , which allow the determination of the exact sequence of nucleotides or bases in either dna or rna for instance , sexual selection could be more likely to affect molecular evolution of the sex chromosomes due to clustering of sex specific genes on the x , y , z or w the introduction of the neutral theory by kimura , quickly followed by king and jukes ' own findings , led to a fierce debate about the relevance of neodarwinism at the molecular level thus , despite the difference in mutation rates , it is essential to incorporate nucleic acid evolution into the discussion of protein evolution the resulting independent inheritance of genes results in more efficient selection , meaning that regions with higher recombination will harbor fewer detrimental mutations , more selectively favored variants , and fewer errors in replication and repair the advent of protein sequencing allowed molecular biologists to create phylogenies based on sequence comparison , and to use the differences between sequence homology as a molecular clock to estimate the time since the last universal common ancestor other journals dedicated to molecular evolution include journal of molecular evolution and molecular phylogenetics and evolution there are sometimes discordances between molecular and morphological evolution , which are reflected in molecular and morphological systematic studies , especially of bacteria , archaea and eukaryotic microbes new genes arise from several different genetic mechanisms including gene duplication , de novo origination , retrotransposition , chimeric gene formation , recruitment of non-coding sequence , and gene truncation the nearly neutral theory expanded the neutralist perspective , suggesting that several mutations are nearly neutral , which means both random drift and natural selection is relevant to their dynamics the nearly neutral theory expanded the neutralist perspective , suggesting that several mutations are nearly neutral , which means both random drift and natural selection is relevant to their dynamics depending on the relative importance assigned to the various forces of evolution , three perspectives provide evolutionary explanations for molecular evolution while acknowledging that many mutations are neutral , selectionists attribute changes in the frequencies of neutral alleles to linkage disequilibrium with other loci that are under selection , rather than to random genetic drift in contrast sexual selection is a product of mate choice and can favor the spread of genetic variants which act counter to natural selection but increase desirability to the opposite sex or increase mating success greater ability to survive or reproduce , are favored in subsequent generations , thereby increasing the instance of underlying genetic variants in a population molecular systematics is the product of the traditional fields of systematics and molecular genetics
