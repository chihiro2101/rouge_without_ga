at the slade school of fine art bomberg was one of the remarkable generation of artists described by their drawing master henry tonks as the school 's second and last '' crisis of brilliance '' and which included stanley spencer , paul nash , ben nicholson , mark gertler and isaac rosenberg his own style was rapidly moving away from these traditional methods , however , particularly under the influence of the march 1912 london exhibition of italian futurists that exposed him to the dynamic abstraction of francis picabia and gino severini , and fry 's second post impressionist exhibition in october of the same year , which displayed the works of pablo picasso , henri matisse and the fauvism alongside those of wyndham lewis , duncan grant and vanessa bell bomberg 's response to this became clear in paintings such as vision of ezekiel ( 1912 ) , in which he proved '' he could absorb the most experimental european ideas , fuse these with jewish influences and come up with a robust alternative of his own '' his dynamic , angular representations of the human form , combining the geometrical abstraction of cubism with the energy of the futurists , established his reputation as a forceful member of the avant-garde and the most audacious of his contemporaries ; bringing him to the attention of wyndham lewis ( who visited him in 1912 ) and filippo marinetti in 1913 , the year in which he was expelled from the slade because of the radicalism of his approach , he travelled to france with jacob epstein , where among others he met amedeo modigliani , andré derain and pablo picasso expelled from the slade in the summer of 1913 , bomberg formed a series of loose affiliations with several groups involved with the contemporary english avant-garde , embarking on a brief and acrimonious association with the bloomsbury group 's omega workshops before exhibiting with the camden town group in december 1913 this can be seen most clearly in his commission for the canadian war memorials fund , sappers at work ( 1918–1919 ) : his first version of the painting was dismissed as a '' futurist abortion '' and was replaced by a second far more representational version in radical opposition to the prevailing currents in avant-garde art , stimulated as these were by the enthusiasm for mechanization in constructivism in russia following the revolution , bomberg went to paint and draw in palestine between 1923 and 1927 , with the assistance of the zionist organization from there followed bomberg 's great period of painting and drawing in landscape , in spain at toledo ( 1928 ) , ronda ( 1934–35 and 1954–57 ) and asturias ( 1935 ) , in cyprus ( 1948 ) and intermittently in britain , perhaps most powerfully in cornwall during world war ii , he painted evening in the city of london ( 1944 ) , showing the blitzed city viewed rising up to a triumphant , surviving st paul 's cathedral on the horizon , since described as the '' most moving of all paintings of wartime britain '' ( martin harrison ) ; a series of flower paintings saturated with turbulent feeling ; and his single commission as a war artist , a series of '' bomb store '' paintings ( 1942 ) expressing bomberg 's expanded first-hand sense of the destructive powers of modern technology in warfare bomberg 's superb draughtsmanship was expressed also in a lifelong series of portraits , from the early period of his botticelli-like '' head of a poet '' ( 1913 ) , a pencil portrait of his friend the poet isaac rosenberg for which he won the henry tonks prize at the slade , to his '' last self-portrait '' ( 1956 ) , painted at ronda , a meditation also on rembrandt unable to get a teaching position after world war ii in any of the most prestigious london art schools , bomberg became the most exemplary teacher of the immediate post-war period in britain , working part-time in a bakery school at the borough polytechnic ( now london south bank university ) in the working-class borough of southwark though his students received no grant and were awarded no diploma , he attracted devoted and highly energetic pupils , with whom he exhibited on an equal basis in london , oxford , and cambridge in two important artists ' groupings in which he was the leading light , the borough group ( 1946–51 ) and the borough bottega ( 1953–55 ) one of bomberg 's admirers , the painter patrick swift , unearthed and edited bomberg 's pensées , and was later to publish them , along with images of bomberg 's work , as 'the bomberg papers ' in his x ( magazine ) ( june 1960 ) prior to that , the exhibition david bomberg en ronda at the museo joaquin peinado in ronda in andalusia ( 1–30 october 2004 ) showed work by bomberg in the city and environment which he had celebrated in paintings and drawings in 1934-35 and 1954–57 work from one of the best collections in private hands was shown on the fiftieth anniversary of his death in the exhibition in celebration of david bomberg 1890-1957 at daniel katz gallery , old bond street , london ( 30 may – 13 july 2007 ) london south bank university , the site of bomberg 's teaching at the former borough polytechnic , received a gift of more than 150 paintings and drawings by bomberg and his students in the borough group – principally dorothy mead , cliff holden , miles richmond , and dennis creffield — the david bomberg legacy he was one of the six artists included in dulwich picture gallery 's 2013 summer exhibition , '' nash , nevinson , spencer , gertler , carrington , bomberg : a crisis of brilliance , 1908-1922 '' glyn hughes 's novel , roth ( simon & schuster , london , 1992 ) – its leading a character a london jewish painter , its cover carrying a reproduction of one of bomberg 's cyprus landscapes – is also loosely based on the author 's reflections on bomberg article on the whitechapel boys guardian review of abbot hall exhibition laurie stewart , notes on the borough group of artists cliff holden , the history of the borough group of artists , 2004 connected , spring 2009 , journal of alumni of london south bank university
