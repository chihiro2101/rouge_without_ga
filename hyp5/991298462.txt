saharan dust in particular can be transported and deposited as far as the caribbean and the amazon basin , and may affect air temperatures , cause ocean cooling , and alter rainfall amounts dust in such places may be suppressed by mechanical methods , including paving or laying down gravel , or stabilizing the surface with water , vegetable oils or other dust abatement , or by using water misters to suppress dust that is already airborne road dust consists of deposits of exhaust gas , particles from tire and brake dust , dust from paved roads or potholes , and dust from construction sites dust in the atmosphere is produced by saltation and sandblasting of sand-sized grains , and it is transported through the troposphere the zodiacal light , as seen in a dark night sky , is produced by sunlight reflected from particles of dust in orbit around the sun control of road dust is a significant challenge in urban areas , and also in other locations with high levels of vehicular traffic upon unsealed roads , such as mines and landfill dumps they are generally found on the floor and other surfaces until disturbed ( by walking , for example ) in addition , if enough coal dust is dispersed within the air in a given area , in very rare circumstances , it can create an explosion hazard under certain circumstances a dust resistant surface is a state of prevention against dust contamination or damage , by a design or treatment of materials and items in manufacturing or through a repair process most governmental epas , including the united states environmental protection agency ( epa ) mandate that facilities that generate fugitive dust , minimize or mitigate the production of dust in their operation dust poses a health threat to children , '' dust mites in the humid atmosphere of bangalore trigger around 60 % of asthma '' older people , and those with respiratory illnesses the tails of comets are produced by emissions of dust and ionized gas from the body of the comet one-third of the global land area is covered by dust-producing surfaces , made up of desert like the sahara which covers 0.9 billion hectares , and drylands which occupy 5.2 billion hectares this airborne dust is considered an aerosol and once in the atmosphere , it can produce strong local radiative forcing they and their feces and other allergens which they produce are major constituents of house dust , but because they are so heavy they are not suspended for long in the air
