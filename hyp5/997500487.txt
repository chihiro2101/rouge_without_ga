) the operation of a thyristor can be understood in terms of a pair of tightly coupled bipolar junction transistors , arranged to cause a self-latching action : : thyristors have three states : reverse blocking mode – voltage is applied in the direction that would be blocked by a diode forward blocking mode – voltage is applied in the direction that would cause a diode to conduct , but the thyristor has not been triggered into conduction forward conducting mode – the thyristor has been triggered into conduction and will remain conducting until the forward current drops below a threshold value known as the '' holding current '' when the anode is at a positive potential v ak with respect to the cathode with no voltage applied at the gate , junctions j 1 and j 3 are forward biased , while junction j 2 is reverse biased once avalanche breakdown has occurred , the thyristor continues to conduct , irrespective of the gate voltage , until : ( a ) the potential v ak is removed or ( b ) the current through the device ( anode−cathode ) becomes less than the holding current specified by the manufacturer thyristors are mainly used where high currents and voltages are involved , and are often used to control alternating currents , where the change of polarity of the current causes the device to switch off automatically , referred to as '' zero cross '' operation the device can be said to operate synchronously ; being that , once the device is triggered , it conducts current in phase with the voltage applied over its cathode to anode junction with no further gate modulation being required , i.e this is not to be confused with asymmetrical operation , as the output is unidirectional , flowing only from cathode to anode , and so is asymmetrical in nature a thyristor is used in conjunction with a zener diode attached to its gate , and if the output voltage of the supply rises above the zener voltage , the thyristor will conduct and short-circuit the power supply output to ground ( in general also tripping an upstream breaker or fuse ) this kind of protection circuit is known as a crowbar , and has the advantage over a standard circuit breaker or fuse in that it creates a high-conductance path to ground for the damaging supply voltage and potentially for stored energy in the system being powered the stabilized high voltage dc supply for the receiver was obtained by moving the switching point of the thyristor device up and down the falling slope of the positive going half of the ac supply input ( if the rising slope was used the output voltage would always rise towards the peak input voltage when the device was triggered and thus defeat the aim of regulation ) since modern thyristors can switch power on the scale of megawatts , thyristor valves have become the heart of high-voltage direct current ( hvdc ) conversion either to or from alternating current because of this , use of triacs with ( for example ) heavily inductive motor loads usually requires the use of a '' snubber '' circuit around the triac to assure that it will turn off with each half-cycle of mains power inverse parallel scrs can also be used in place of the triac ; because each scr in the pair has an entire half-cycle of reverse polarity applied to it , the scrs , unlike triacs , are sure to turn off although thyristors are heavily used in megawatt-scale rectifier of ac to dc , in low- and medium-power ( from few tens of watts to few tens of kilowatts ) applications they have virtually been replaced by other devices with superior switching characteristics like power mosfets or igbts '' safe firing of thyristors '' on powerguru.org as well as the usual failure modes due to exceeding voltage , current or power ratings , thyristors have their own particular modes of failure , including : turn on di/dt – in which the rate of rise of on-state current after triggering is higher than can be supported by the spreading speed of the active conduction area ( scrs & triacs ) acs acst agt – anode gate thyristor – a thyristor with gate on n-type layer near to the anode ascr – asymmetrical scr bct – bidirectional control thyristor – a bidirectional switching device containing two thyristor structures with separate gate contacts bod – breakover diode – a gateless thyristor triggered by avalanche current diac – bidirectional trigger device dynistor – unidirectional switching device shockley diode – unidirectional trigger and switching device sidac – bidirectional switching device trisil , sidactor – bidirectional protection devices brt – base resistance controlled thyristor eto – emitter turn-off thyristor rashid , muhammad h csmt or mcs – mos composite static induction thyristor put or pujt – programmable unijunction transistor – a thyristor with gate on n-type layer near to the anode used as a functional replacement for unijunction transistor rct – reverse conducting thyristor scs – silicon controlled switch or thyristor tetrode – a thyristor with both cathode and anode gates scr – silicon controlled rectifier sith – static induction thyristor , or fcth – field controlled thyristor – containing a gate structure that can shut down anode current flow since no electronic boards need to be provided at the potential of the thyristor in order to trigger it , light-triggered thyristors can be an advantage in high-voltage applications such as hvdc light-triggered thyristors are available with in-built over-voltage ( vbo ) protection , which triggers the thyristor when the forward voltage across it becomes too high ; they have also been made with in-built forward recovery protection , but not commercially following light exposure , when light is absent , if the power is not removed and the polarities of the cathode and anode have not yet reversed , the lascr is still in the '' on '' state
