freegans ' goal of reduced participation in capitalism and tactics of recovering wasted goods shares elements with the diggers , an anarchist street theater group based in haight-ashbury in san francisco in the 1960s that organized free housing and clinics and gave away food rescue the word '' freegan '' itself was allegedly invented in 1994 by keith mchenry , the co-founder of food not bombs—an anarchist group that distributes free vegetarian meals as a protest against militarism and as a way of providing '' solidarity not charity '' —to refer to vegans who eat animal products if they find them in a dumpster system , the all-oppressive dollar , the wage slavery , the whole burrito '' in favor of '' living a full satisfying life.while treading lightly on the earth '' freegans are usually distinguished as being a subset of this population which has an ideological or political motivation for recovering waste or avoiding consumption , although some freegans also say that they do so for amusement , to acquire free goods , or out of religious conviction freeganism 's initial practitioners and forerunners like food not bombs were explicitly anti-capitalist , arguing that capitalism is responsible for excessive consumption , the abuse of human laborers and non-human animals , and the waste of resources freegans ' approach to anti-capitalism is broadly anarchism in orientation : rather than seeking to seize state power , freegans claim to be engaged in '' prefigurative politics '' , using wasted resources to build a new society '' in the shell of the old '' based on values of '' community , generosity , social concern , freedom , cooperation , and sharing '' for many , statistics about the ecological impacts of food waste—up to 12 % of global cropland and 23 % of global freshwater goes to produce food which is never consumed —serve as justification for a complete rejection of the capitalist food system freegans are best known for recovering discarded food from commercial establishments , a practice known as '' dumpster diving '' or '' urban foraging '' in north america , '' skipping '' , '' bin raiding '' , or '' skipitarianism '' in the uk , '' skip dipping '' in australia , '' containern '' in germany , or '' doing the duck '' in new zealand freegan diets are thus made possible by the range of practices that produce commercial food waste that is nonetheless still edible , such as conservative sell-by dates , the deliberate overstocking of certain perishable products ( like baked goods ) , or aesthetic criteria for fruits and vegetables however , dumpster diving is not limited to rummaging for food ; freegans report recovering clothing , books , appliances , bicycles , and furniture from commercial dumpsters as well '' sharing '' is also presented as a common freegan practice , associated with the anarchist idea of a '' gift economy '' squatting was widespread in western europe as well as parts of the united states in the 1980s and 1990s , and activists used squatted buildings not only for housing but also to create community centers , pirate radio stations , or free schools contact with waste is seen as a taboo and socially unacceptable in most developed countries , and freegans are often associated with stigmatized and racialized groups like the homeless or even compared to scavenging '' pest '' animals like raccoons a typical response is that freegan practices are not limited to dumpster diving , but include also actions like guerilla gardening , wild food foraging , or sewing or bike repair '' skill shares '' that are more fully autonomous from the conventional economy as one freegan of color wrote , '' i am extremely embarrassed for people to see me diving , because i can tell that i ’ m not just me , i ’ m also a representation of black people in general.i got harassed by security several times while diving on my own campus , until my white friends pop their heads out of the dumpsters these actions could be seen as part of a broader criminalization of acts of survival—like sleeping in public places , sharing food without a permit , or recovering aluminum cans to re-sell—that has affected freegans as well as affiliated groups like food not bombs and the homeless
