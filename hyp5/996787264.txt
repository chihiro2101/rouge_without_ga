'' little research has been conducted on carol singing , but one of the few sociological studies of caroling in the early 21st century in finland determined that the sources of songs are often misunderstood , and that it is simplistic to suggest caroling is mostly related to christian beliefs , for it also reinforces preservation of diverse national customs and local family traditions a modern form of the practice of caroling can be seen in '' dial-a-carol , '' an annual tradition held by students at the university of illinois at urbana–champaign , wherein potential audiences call the singers to request a performance over phone call for example , many of the carols written by alfred burt are sung regularly in both sacred and secular settings , and are among the better known modern christmas carols isaac watts , the '' father of english hymnody '' , composed '' joy to the world '' , which has become a popular christmas carol even though it is widely believed that watts did not write it to be sung only at christmas several different christmas episodes , apart from the birth of jesus itself , are described in christmas carols , such as : the annunciation , for example '' gabriel 's message '' the census of augustus , a rare subject , but touched upon in '' on a day when men were counted '' by daniel thambyrajah niles ( 1964 ) the annunciation to the shepherds , for example '' while shepherds watched their flocks '' the adoration of the shepherds , for example the czech carol '' nesem vám noviny '' ( translated into english as '' come , all ye shepherds '' ) the star of bethlehem , for example , '' star of the east '' the visit of the magi , for example '' we three kings '' the massacre of the innocents , for example the '' coventry carol '' in addition , some carols describe christmas-related events of a religious nature , but not directly related to the birth of jesus for example : '' good king wenceslas '' , based on a legend about saint wenceslaus helping a poor man on 26 december ( the feast of stephen ) '' ding dong merrily on high '' and '' i heard the bells on christmas day '' , reflecting on the practice of ringing church bells at christmas in england and other countries , such as poland ( kolęda ) , romania ( colinde ) and bulgaria ( koledari ) , there is a tradition of christmas caroling ( earlier known as wassailing ) , in which groups of singers travel from house to house , singing carols at each , for which they are often rewarded with gifts , money , mince pies , or a glass of an appropriate beverage shortly before , in 1878 , the salvation army , under charles fry , instituted the idea of playing carols at christmas , using a brass band most churches have special services at which carols are sung , generally combined with readings from scripture about the birth of christ ;
