59 he returned to rome after plautus ' death ( 62 ad ) , but as a consequence of his practising and teaching stoicism , he became an object of suspicion and dislike at nero 's court , and was accordingly banished to the island of gyarus ( 65 ad ) on a trumped-up charge of participation in the pisonian conspiracy so highly was musonius esteemed in rome that vespasian allowed him to remain in rome when the other philosophers were banished from the city ( 71 ad ) , cassius dio , lxv when marcus antonius primus , the general of vespasian , was marching upon rome ( 69 ad ) , he joined the ambassadors that were sent by vitellius to the victorious general , and going among the soldiers of the latter , preached about the blessings of peace and the dangers of war , but was soon made to stop at the same time he is convinced of the power of philosophy over the minds of people ; by it he hopes to heal all the corruption of the human mind by the time of nero , he was already famous in rome , where he taught stoic philosophy 81 when the party of vitellius gained the upper hand , musonius was able to accuse , and obtain the conviction of , publius egnatius celer , the stoic philosopher who had condemned barea soranus he gives only a little attention to the stoic physics of the stoics ; he asserts that the gods know all things without need of reasoning , since to them nothing can be obscure or unknown the son of a roman eques of the name of capito , musonius rufus was born in volsinii , etruria suda μ 1305 , musonius about 20–30 ad he agrees that it is easy to follow one 's own nature , and the only great impediment which he can find to a truly moral life is the prejudices with which the mind is filled from childhood , and the evil habits confirmed by practices still , he considers it becoming in a philosopher to wear the philosopher 's robe , to allow the hair to grow , and to retire from general society 13 but eventually he was exiled anyway ( perhaps around 75 ad ) , only returning after vespasian 's death ( 79 ad ) musonius pays much more attention to ethics than logic or physics ; for he holds that philosophy is nothing else than an investigation and practice of what is becoming and obligatory ; and philosophy , he says , is merely the pursuit of a virtuous life the philosophy he would have everyone cultivate is not a mere matter of words , of instruction , or of the school ; but one that everyone by their own reflection and practice may pursue for himself
