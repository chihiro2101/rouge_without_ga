in this orientation , the ( âˆ’ ) diester tartrate preferentially interacts with the top half of the molecule , and the ( + ) diester tartrate preferentially interacts with the bottom half of the molecule a rectangle is drawn around the double bond in the same plane as the carbons of the double bond ( the xy-plane ) , with the allylic alcohol in the bottom right corner and the other substituents in their appropriate corners to demonstrate the synthetic utility of the sharpless epoxidation , the sharpless group created synthetic intermediates of various natural products : methymycin , erythromycin , leukotriene c-1 , and ( + ) -disparlure although vanadium is generally less reactive than other metal complexes , in the presence of allylic alcohols , the rate of the reaction is accelerated beyond that of molybdenum , the most reactive metal for epoxidations in the vanadium case , the required geometry leads to severe a 1,2 interactions , but avoids a 1,3 , leading to formation of the epoxide anti to the directing group regardless , all studies have concluded that the catalyst is a dimer of ti ( tartrate ) ( or ) 2 the sharpless epoxidation has been used for the total synthesis of various saccharides , terpenes , leukotrienes , pheromones , and antibiotics furthermore , with the exception noted above , a given dialkyl tartrate will preferentially add to the same face independent of the substitution on the alkene the sharpless epoxidation is viable with a large range of primary and secondary alkenic alcohols the putative catalyst was determined using x-ray structural determinations of model complexes which have the necessary structural components to catalyze the sharpless epoxidation however , it was found that for metal catalyzed systems such as those based on vanadium , reaction rates were accelerated when the hydroxyl group was in the axial position by a factor of 34 although the presence of an allylic alcohol does lead to increased stereoselectivity , the rates of these reactions are slower than systems lacking alcohols
