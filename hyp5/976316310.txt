your contributions will be edited , rearranged , re-worded and expanded , and you should n't be shy about doing the same to other people 's work unlike the rest of the site , you can put whatever you want on your user page - opinions , hobbies , news , random humor and links to your home pages on other encyclopedia sites - as long as you do n't dump a huge amount of content on your user page that is unrelated to wikipedia for example , you may want to link to your h2g2 personal space from your wikipedia user page a userbox has been created specifically to help you do this , called user : ubx/h2g2 it looks like this : use this code to add it to your user page , replacing u123 with your own u-number from h2g2 : you may also be interested in reading h2g2 's entry about wikipedia please copy your good encyclopedic content from h2g2 to wikipedia ! do n't forget to search for related wikipedia content first & mdash ; if wikipedia already has an article on the subject , just merge your own content into it : be bold ! mention on the wikipedia article 's talk page ( click '' discuss this page '' ) that you originally wrote the material for h2g2 and give your researcher number ( u-number ) , so that nobody thinks you 're committing plagiarism however , you retain the copyright to your own work and are free to modify and distribute it in any way you wish wikipedia titles are generally shorter , so phrases like '' a short guide to '' should be removed , and most titles should only have lower-case letters it is similar to h2g2 's requirements for balance in edited entries on controversial subjects , but there are subtle differences in the two policies while you are welcome to copy and reuse any wikipedia article , e.g on wikipedia there 's a genuine plethora of people and locations to ask for help , either generally or more specifically about the transfer from h2g2 to wikipedia
