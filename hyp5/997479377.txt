similarly , near new moon , sunlight that has been backscattered from earth toward the sun and also the moon , which is in almost the same direction , and then backscattered again from the moon toward earth appears much brighter , as viewed from earth , than it would without the retroreflective effects thus , the part of earth where it is daytime and from where the moon is visible determines how bright the earthshine on the moon appears at any given time ringshine is when sunlight is reflected by a planet 's ring system onto the planet or onto the moons of the planet for example , when its phase is full , the moon reflects light preferentially toward the sun and also earth , which is in almost the same direction in the scots ballad of sir patrick spens earthshine is most readily visible from a few nights before until a few nights after a new moon , during the ( waxing or waning ) crescent phase while the red edge is almost certainly the easiest way to directly detect life on earth via earthshine observations , it could be extremely difficult to interpret a similar feature due to life on another planet , since the wavelength of the spectral feature is not known in advance ( unlike most atomic or molecular spectral features ) science nasa : earthshine nasa astronomy picture of the day , 19 april 2002 earthshine ' linked to solar cycle , climate change , space.com scientists watch dark side of the moon to monitor earth 's climate , american geophysical union earthshine picture gallery on skytrip.de unlike many traditional astronomical challenges , the most serious challenge for these missions is not gathering enough photons from the faint planet , but rather detecting a faint planet that is extremely close to a very bright star when it encounters a transparent sphere , light is preferentially heiligenschein in a path , within the sphere , which exits it in the direction from which it entered when the lunar phase is new as viewed from earth , earth would appear nearly fully sunlit from the moon sunlight is reflected from earth to the night side of the moon
