the sunni school of thought believe that shura is recommended in the qur'an ( though some classical jurists maintained it is obligatory ) , the qur'an , and by numerous hadith , or oral traditions of the sayings and doings of muhammad and his sahaba the qur'an says : '' those who hearken to their lord , and establish regular prayer ; who ( conduct ) their affairs by mutual consultation among themselves ; who spend out of what we bestow on them for sustenance '' are praised online qur'an project 42.39 the 159th verse of 3rd sura orders muhammad to consult with believers in an analysis of the shura chapter of the qur'an , qutb noted that islam requires only that the ruler consult with at least some of the ruled ( usually the elite ) , within the general context of god-made laws that the ruler must execute the system of islam , by taqiuddin an-nabhani , p.39 under the hizb ut-tahrir constitution , non-muslims may not serve a caliph or any other ruling official , nor vote for these officials , but may be part of the majlis and voice '' complaints in respect to unjust acts performed by the rulers or the misapplication of islam upon them many traditional sunni islamic lawyers agree that to be in keeping with islam , a government should have some form of council of consultation or majlis al-shura , although it must recognize that god and not the people are sovereign taqiuddin al-nabhani , the founder of the modern transnational islamist party hizb ut-tahrir , writes that shura is important and part of '' the ruling structure '' of the islamic caliphate , '' but not one of its pillars this meeting did not include some of those with a strong interest in the matter—especially ali ibn abi talib , muhammad 's cousin and son-in-law ; people who wanted ali to be the caliph ( ruler ) ( later known as shia ) still consider abu bakr an illegitimate leader of the caliphate shi ' a do not stress the role of shura in choosing leaders , but believe that the divine vice-regent is chosen by god , or allah , from the lineage of muhammad ( ahl al-bayt ) the verses indicate that shura is praiseworthy but do not indicate who should be consulted , what they should be consulted about , or whether the ruler or the shura should prevail in the event the two do not agree al-mawardi also said that in emergencies when there is no caliphate and no majlis , the people themselves should create a majlis , select a list of candidates for caliph , and then the majlis should select a caliph from the list of candidates the qur'an says : thus it is due to mercy from god that you deal with them gently , and had you been rough , hard hearted , they would certainly have dispersed from around you ; pardon them therefore and ask pardon for them , and take counsel with them in the affair ; so when you have decided , then place your trust in god ; surely god loves those who trust the largest shi ' a sect believes that the current imam is in '' occultation '' , hidden away until the last days , but there are minority shi ' a who follow leaders believed to be infallible imams shuras have also been a feature of revolutions in islamic societies , such as in the iranian revolution of 1979 , where they were formed by workers and held considerable power over parts of the economy for a year before being dismantled in persian language and dari in afghanistan , the term , shuravi is used for 'soviet ' ( the etymology being related to council ) sunni muslims believe that islam requires all decisions made by and for the muslim societies to be made by shura of the muslim community and believe this to be the basis for implementing representative democracy the difference between the two appears more semantic than actual—the latter accept that the rulers must be accounted in all aspects of ruling , to ensure affairs are managed in the best possible way whether decisions were taken through consultation or not the first mention of shura in the qur'an comes in the 2nd sura of qur'an 2:233 in the matter of the collective family decision regarding weaning the child from mother 's milk
