bohm was born in wilkes-barre , pennsylvania , to a hungarian jewish immigrant father , samuel bohm , - by the numbers – david bohm and a lithuanian jewish mother during his time at the radiation laboratory , bohm was in a relationship with the future betty friedan and also helped to organize a local chapter of the federation of architects , engineers , chemists and technicians , a small labor union affiliated to the congress of industrial organizations ( cio ) though oppenheimer had asked bohm to work with him at los alamos ( the top-secret laboratory established in 1942 to design the atom bomb ) , the project 's director , brigadier general leslie groves , would not approve bohm 's security clearance after seeing evidence of his politics and his close friendship with weinberg , who had been suspected of espionage without security clearance , bohm was denied access to his own work ; not only would he be barred from defending his thesis , he was not even allowed to write his own thesis in the first place ! '' to satisfy the university , oppenheimer certified that bohm had successfully completed the research bohm then left for brazil to assume a professorship of physics at the university of são paulo , at jayme tiomno 's invitation and on the recommendation of both einstein and oppenheimer starting from the realization that the wkb approximation of quantum mechanics leads to deterministic equations and convinced that a mere approximation could not turn a probabilistic theory into a deterministic theory , he doubted the inevitability of the conventional approach to quantum mechanics bohm 's aim was not to set out a deterministic , mechanical viewpoint but to show that it was possible to attribute properties to an underlying reality , in contrast to the conventional approach he began to develop his own interpretation ( the de broglie–bohm theory , also called the pilot wave theory ) , the predictions of which agreed perfectly with the non-deterministic quantum theory he initially called his approach a hidden variable theory , but he later called it ontological theory , reflecting his view that a stochastic process underlying the phenomena described by his theory might one day be found david bohm , basil hiley : the undivided universe : an ontological interpretation of quantum theory , edition published in the taylor & francis e-library 2009 ( first edition routledge , 1993 ) , , p after bohm 's arrival in brazil on 10 october 1951 , the us consul in são paulo confiscated his passport , informing him he could retrieve it only to return to his country , which reportedly frightened bohm russell olwell : physics and politics in cold war america : the two exiles of david bohm , working paper number & nbsp ;

he was able to reclaim it only decades later , in 1986 , after pursuing a lawsuit & nbsp ; 1–34 , issn 0890-9997 , 2005 at the university of são paulo , bohm worked on the causal theory that became the subject of his publications in 1952 jean-pierre vigier traveled to são paulo , where he worked with bohm for three months ; ralph schiller , student of cosmologist peter bergmann , was his assistant for two years ; he worked with tiomno and walther schützer ; and mario bunge stayed to work with him for one year his work with vigier was the beginning of a long-standing cooperation between the two and louis de broglie , in particular , on connections to the hydrodynamics model proposed by madelung in 1959 , bohm and aharonov discovered the aharonov–bohm effect , showing how a magnetic field could affect a region of space in which the field had been shielded , but its vector potential did not vanish there that showed for the first time that the magnetic vector potential , hitherto a mathematical convenience , could have real physical ( quantum ) effects david peat : science , order , and creativity , 1987 in the view of bohm and hiley , '' things , such as particles , objects , and indeed subjects '' exist as '' semi-autonomous quasi-local features '' of an underlying activity pribram , bohm was involved in the early development of the holonomic model of the functioning of the brain , a model for human cognition that is drastically different from conventionally-accepted ideas comparison between karl pribram 's '' holographic brain theory '' and more conventional models of neuronal computation bohm worked with pribram on the theory that the brain operates in a manner that is similar to a hologram , in accordance with quantum mathematical principles and the characteristics of wave patterns in addition to his scientific work , bohm was deeply interested in exploring the nature of consciousness , with particular attention to the role of thought as it relates to attention , motivation , and conflict in the individual and in society a more recent and extensive examination of the relationship between the two men presents it in a more positive light and shows that bohm 's work in the psychological field was complementary to and compatible with his contributions to theoretical physics in the seminar , bohm described the pervasive influence of thought throughout society , including the many erroneous assumptions about the nature of thought and its effects in daily life he points out that thought is the ubiquitous tool that is used to solve every kind of problem : personal , social , scientific , and so on bohm maintains that thought is a system , in the sense that it is an interconnected network of concepts , ideas and assumptions that pass seamlessly between individuals and throughout society in his book on creativity , quoting alfred korzybski , the polish-american who developed the field of general semantics , bohm expressed the view that '' metaphysics is an expression of a world view '' and is '' thus to be regarded as an art form , resembling poetry in some ways and mathematics in others , rather than as an attempt to say something true about reality as a whole '' gardner said that bohm 's view of the interconnectedness of mind and matter ( on one occasion , he summarized : '' even the electron is informed with a certain level of mind to address societal problems during his later years , bohm wrote a proposal for a solution that has become known as '' bohm dialogue '' , in which equal status and '' free space '' form the most important prerequisites of communication and the appreciation of differing personal beliefs he also spoke to audiences across europe and north america on the importance of dialogue as a form of sociotherapy , a concept he borrowed from london psychiatrist and practitioner of group analysis patrick de maré , and he had a series of meetings with the dalai lama david peat , infinite potential : the life and times of david bohm , reading , massachusetts : addison wesley , 1997 , pp david peat , infinite potential : the life and times of david bohm , reading , massachusetts : addison wesley , 1997 , pp in the early 1950s , bohm 's causal quantum theory of hidden variables was mostly negatively received , with a widespread tendency among physicists to systematically ignore both bohm personally and his ideas there was a significant revival of interest in bohm 's ideas in the late 1950s and the early 1960s ;
