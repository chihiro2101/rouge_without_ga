this austere location , hardly an obvious choice for the site of a royal palace , was chosen by king philip ii of spain , and it was he who ordained the building of a grand edifice here to commemorate the 1557 spanish victory at the battle of st image : escorial traza def.jpg thumb left el escorial : floor plan , based on the floorplan of solomon 's temple since then , el escorial has been the burial site for most of the spanish kings of the last five centuries , bourbons as well as habsburgs the royal pantheon contains the tombs of the holy roman emperor charles v ( who ruled spain as king charles i ) , philip ii , philip iii , philip iv , charles ii , louis i , charles iii , charles iv , ferdinand vii , isabella ii , alfonso xii , and alfonso xiii two bourbon kings , philip v ( who reigned from 1700 to 1724 ) and ferdinand vi ( 1746–1759 ) , as well as king amadeus ( 1870–1873 ) , are not buried in the monastery other buildings had been constructed with interior courtyards fronting on churches or chapels ; king 's college , cambridge , dating from 1441 , is one such example ; the old ospedale maggiore , milan 's first hospital , begun in 1456 by antonio filarete , is another grid-like building with interior courtyards strikingly similar to el escorial is the layout of the alcázar of seville and the design of the alhambra at granada where , as at el escorial , two courtyards in succession separate the main portal of the complex from a fully enclosed place of worship nonetheless , the most persuasive theory for the origin of the floor plan is that it is based on descriptions of the temple of solomon by the judeo-roman historian , flavius josephus : a portico followed by a courtyard open to the sky , followed by a second portico and a second courtyard , all flanked by arcades and enclosed passageways , leading to the '' holy of holies '' echoing the same theme , a fresco in the center of el escorial 's library , a reminder of solomon ’ s legendary wisdom , affirms philip 's preoccupation with the great jewish king , his thoughtful and logical character , and his extraordinary monumental temple hermetism and the mystical architecture of the society of jesus in '' baroque art : the jesuit contribution '' by rudolf wittkower & irma jaffe the temple-of-solomon design , if indeed it was the basis for el escorial , was extensively modified to accommodate the additional functions and purposes philip ii intended the building to serve beyond being a monastery , el escorial is also a pantheon , a basilica , a convent , a school , a library , and a royal palace at each of the four corners is a square tower surmounted by a spire , and , near the center of the complex ( and taller than the rest ) rise the pointed belfries and round dome of the basilica in order to describe the parts of the great building in a coherent fashion , it may be useful to undertake an imaginary walking tour , beginning with the main entrance at the center of the western facade : this has three doors : the middle one leads to the courtyard of the kings ( patio de los reyes ) and the side ones lead to a school and the other to a monastery next is the palace of the austrians ( palacio de los austrias ) , also known as the house of the king ( casa del rey ) , which is found behind the presbytery of the basilica left the basilica of san lorenzo el real , the central building in the el escorial complex , was originally designed , like most of the late gothic cathedrals of western europe , to take the form of a latin cross as such , it has a long nave on the west-east axis intersected by a pair of shorter transepts , one to the north and one directly opposite , to the south , about three-quarters of the way between the west entrance and the high altar coincident with this shift in approach , the bell towers at the western end of the church were somewhat reduced in size and the small half-dome intended to stand over the altar was replaced with a full circular dome over the center of the church , where the four arms of the greek cross meet however , the roman dome is supported by ranks of tapered corinthian columns , with their extravagant capitals of acanthus leaves and their elaborately fluted shafts , while the dome at el escorial , soaring nearly one hundred metres into the air , is supported by four heavy granite piers connected by simple romanesque arches and decorated by simple doric pilasters , plain , solid , and largely unprepossessing peter 's as the quintessential expression of baroque sensuality and the basilica at el escorial as a statement of the stark rigidity and grim purposefulness of the inquisition , the two sides of the counter-reformation in a shallow niche at the center of the lowest level is the tabernacle , a repository for the physical elements of the communion ceremony , a so-called '' house of the sacrament '' , designed by juan de herrera in jasper and bronze michelangelo died in 1564 , scarcely a year after the first stones at el escorial were laid , and titian , when asked to come to spain , respectfully refused on the basis of his advanced age consequently , philip consulted his foreign ambassadors for recommendations , and the result was a lengthy parade of the lesser european artists of that time , all swanning through the construction site at el escorial seeking the king 's favor this chamber consists of twenty-six marble sepulchres containing the remains of the kings and queens regnant ( the only queen regnant since philip ii being isabella ii ) , of the habsburg and bourbon dynasties from charles i to the present , except for philip v and ferdinand vi the remains of alphonse xiii 's third son juan , count of barcelona and daughter-in-law maria de las mercedes ( the father and mother of the former king juan carlos i ) , lie at a prepared place called a pudridero , or decaying chamber , awaiting interment in the pantheon of the kings in these rooms , the remains of the deceased are placed in a small leaden urn , which in turn will be placed in the marble sepulchres of the appropriate pantheon after the passage of fifty years , the estimated time necessary for the complete decomposition of the bodies secondly , the count of barcelona never reigned as king , although he was head of the spanish royal family between the renunciation of his father 's rights on 14 january 1941 and his renunciation of his own rights in favour of his son , juan carlos i on 14 may 1977 however , some consider the count of barcelona to have been de jure king of spain from 1941 - 1977 , which in turn would make him , his mother , queen victoria eugenie and his wife , the countess of barcelona eligible for interment in the pantheon of kings in 1994 , king juan carlos i signed a decree raising his cousin and close personal friend carlos , duke of calabria to the status of a spanish infante , making him eligible for interment in the pantheon of the princes

superior de investigaciones científicas , centro de estudios históricos , departamento de arte diego velázquez , 1987 from the beginning , the royal library was meant to be a monumental work of art , and its execution was commissioned to the most prominent architects of the moment : juan de toledo and juan de herrera it constituted , along with the basilica , the heart of the entire project and the whole exterior and distribution of the project was redrafted several times to accommodate changes in the organization of the library itself the books of the most '' profane '' subjects , such as history , geography or botanics , are located in the part closest to the entrance , and as the corridors advance towards the basilica the subjects turn into more abstract forms of themselves like poetry , grammar or mathematics the subjects closest to the basilica are those the king conceived as being the most abstract distillation of the others , and the closest to the origin , which was god in the basilica : theology , geometry , and mathematics the visitor must leave the noisy world behind and walk through the halls of knowledge in a specific , comprehensible order from concreteness to abstraction before being able to reach god and understand his message , a notion quite in line with both charles i and philip ii 's hermeticist view of religion this library was a renaissance statement of power , majesty , prowess , and intellectual world leadership designed for both the preservation of the old ( binding multiple cultural histories into a single catholic spanish culture ) and discovery of the new ( imprinted by that culture ) it was planned by juan de herrera , who shared the king 's neoplatonic views and also designed the library ’ s shelves ; the frescoes on the vaulted ceilings were painted by pellegrino tibaldi during the reign of phillip ii , there was an entire room dedicated to ancient manuscripts , most of them in latin , many in greek , but also some in hebrew , aramaic , arabic , italian , french , and spanish other valuable libraries acquired from various erudites by king philip ii were the library of pedro fajardo , and of antonio agustín , one of the largest in spain at the time in addition to continuing the search for and purchase of especially valuable and old books , he promulgated a new decree according to which the library of el escorial ought to receive a copy of every book published inside the empire shortly after , as the habsburg dynasty came to its end and the bourbons took the throne after the war of the spanish succession , a further loss took place , as the bourbon kings reversed the trend of acquiring books for the library and instead proceeded to take books out to send to france or to their own libraries juan de herrera also designed the casas de oficios ( official buildings ) opposite the monastery 's north façade ; and his successor , francisco de mora , designed the casa de la compaña ( company
