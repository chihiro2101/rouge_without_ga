jet propulsion of aircraft part iii g geoffrey smith flight september 25th 1941 after other jet-engines had been run , romanian inventor henri coandă claimed to have built a jet-powered aircraft in 1910 , the coandă-1910 , however to support this claim , he had to make substantial alterations to the drawings he used to support his subsequently debunked claims in fact the ducted-fan engine backfired , setting the aircraft on fire before any flights were ever made , and it lacked nearly all of the features necessary for a jet engine - including a lack of fuel injection , and any concern about hot jet efflux being directed at a highly flammable fabric surface the turbojet was invented in the 1930s , independently by frank whittle and later hans von ohain the first turbojet aircraft to fly was the heinkel he 178 , on august 27 , 1939 in rostock ( germany ) , england , 2009 this was largely a proof of concept , as the problem of '' creep '' ( metal fatigue caused by the high temperatures within the engine ) had not been solved , and the engine quickly burned out it was the first jet aircraft recognised by the fédération aéronautique internationale ( at the time the german he 178 program was still kept secret ) campini began development of the motorjet in 1932 , which differed from a true turbojet , in that the air was driven through by a piston engine , instead of the exhaust gas , a much more complex solution '' flight ( flightglobal.com ) , 27 october 1949 p554 the united states produced the bell xp-59a using two examples of a version of the whittle engine built by general electric , which flew on october 1 , 1942 the meteor was the first production jet , with the first orders for production examples being made on 8 august 1941 , butler , 2006 , p.8 the prototype first flying on 5 march 1943 and the first production airframe flying on 12 january 1944 , butler , 2006 , p.23 while the first orders for production me 262 aircraft were not issued until 25 may 1943 , radinger , 1996 , p.33 and the first production me 262 did not fly until 28 march 1944 radinger , 1996 , p.49 despite the me 262 program having started earlier than that of the meteor , as projekt 1065 , with initial plans drawn up by dr waldemar voigt 's design team in april 1939 the me 262 had first flown on april 18 , 1941 , but mass production had not started until early 1944 with the first squadrons operational that year , too late for a decisive effect on the outcome of the world war ii around this time , mid 1944 , the united kingdom 's gloster meteor was being committed to defence of the uk against the v-1 flying bomb & nbsp ; – itself a pulsejet-powered aircraft & nbsp ; and direct ancestor of the cruise missile– and then ground-attack operations over europe in the last months of the war by the end of 1945 , the us had introduced their first jet fighter , the lockheed p-80 shooting star into service and the uk its second fighter design , the de havilland vampire the underslung engines were found to be advantageous in the event of a propellant leak , and so the 707 looked rather different from the comet : the 707 has a shape that is effectively the same as that of contemporary aircraft , with marked commonality still evident today for example with the 737 ( fuselage ) and a340 ( single deck , swept wing , four below-wing engines ) because of the way they work , the typical exhaust speed of jet engines is transonic or faster , therefore most jet aircraft need to fly at high speeds , either supersonic or speeds just below the speed of sound ( '' transonic '' ) so as to achieve efficient flight jet aircraft are usually designed using the whitcomb area rule , which says that the total area of cross-section of the aircraft at any point along the aircraft from the nose must be approximately the same as that of a sears-haack body in aircraft overall propulsive efficiency \eta is the efficiency , in percent , with which the energy contained in a vehicle 's propellant is converted into useful energy , to replace losses due to air drag , gravity , and acceleration it is always less than 100 % because of kinetic energy loss to the exhaust , and less-than-ideal efficiency of the propulsive mechanism , whether a propeller , a jet exhaust , or a fan for jet aircraft the propulsive efficiency ( essentially energy efficiency ) is highest when the engine emits an exhaust jet at a speed that is the same as , or nearly the same as , the vehicle velocity the official erich warsitz website ( the world 's first jet pilot ) , inclusive rare videos ( heinkel he 178 ) and audio commentaries
