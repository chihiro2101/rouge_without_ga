the letter or number corresponding to the filter was used as an index into a chart of appropriate aperture and shutter speed combinations for a given film speed many modern consumer still and video cameras include a built-in meter that measures a scene-wide light level and are able to make an approximate measure of appropriate exposure based on that photographers working with controlled lighting and cinematographers use handheld light meters to precisely measure the light falling on various parts of their subjects and use suitable lighting to produce the desired exposure levels an unusual scene with a preponderance of light colors or specular highlights would have a higher reflectance ; a reflected-light meter taking a reading would incorrectly compensate for the difference in reflectance and lead to underexposure badly underexposed sunset photos are common exactly because of this effect : the brightness of the setting sun fools the camera 's light meter and , unless the in-camera logic or the photographer take care to compensate , the picture will be grossly underexposed and dull this pitfall ( but not in the setting-sun case ) is avoided by incident-light meters which measure the amount of light falling on the subject using an integrating sphere ( usually , a translucent hemispherical plastic dome is used to approximate this ) placed on top of the light sensor another way to avoid under- or over-exposure for subjects with unusual reflectance is to use a spot meter : a reflected-light meter that measures light in a very tight cone , typically with a one degree circular angle of view an experienced photographer can take multiple readings over the shadows , midrange and highlights of the scene to determine optimal exposure , using systems like the zone system when using a film whose spectral sensitivity is not a good match to that of the light meter , for example orthochromatic black-and-white or infrared film , the meter may require special filters and re-calibration to match the sensitivity of the film in most cases , an incident-light meter will cause a medium tone to be recorded as a medium tone , and a reflected-light meter will cause whatever is metered to be recorded as a medium tone for reflected-light meters , camera settings are related to iso speed and subject luminance by the reflected-light exposure equation : \frac where “ effective scene illuminance ” is that measured by a meter with a hemispherical receptor however , the response of a hemispherical receptor to an off-axis light source is approximately that of a cardioid rather than a cosine , so the 12 % “ reflectance ” determined for an incident-light meter with a hemispherical receptor is valid only when the light source is on the receptor axis at best , a flat card is an approximation to a three-dimensional scene , and measurement of a test card may lead to underexposure unless adjustment is made there are , however , significant obstacles to overcome in order to achieve a successful implementation of light meters in lighting systems , of which user acceptance is by far the most formidable therefore , different switching algorithms have been developed : difference algorithm , where lights are switched on at a lower light level than they switch off , thus taking ensuring the difference between the light level of the 'on ' state and 'off ' state is not too big time delay algorithms : a certain amount of time must pass since the last switch a certain amount of time at a sufficient illumination level must pass in scientific research & development uses , a light meter consists of a radiometer ( the electronics/readout ) , a photo-diode or sensor ( generates an output when exposed to electromagnetic radiation/light ) a filter ( used to modify the incoming light so only the desired portion of incoming radiation reaches the sensor ) and a cosine correcting input optic ( assures the sensor can see the light coming in from all directions accurately ) when the word light meter or photometer is used in place of radiometer or optometer , or it is often assumed the system was configured to see only visible light the sensor will send a signal to the meter that is proportional to the amount of light that reaches the sensor after being collected by the optics and passing through the filter units : for illuminance the units are typically only lux and foot-candles but many light meters can also be used for uv , vis and ir applications so the readout could change to w/cm^2 , candela , watts etc for example , uva and uvb light meters are used for phototherapy or treatment of skin conditions , germicidal radiometers are used for measuring the uvc level from lamps used for disinfection and sterilization , luminance meters are used to measure the brightness of a sign , display or exit sign , par quantum sensors are used to measure how much of a given light source 's emission will help plants grow , and uv-curing radiometers test how much of the lights emission is effective for hardening a glue , plastic , or protective coating in the realm of disinfection , uvc is typically measured in watts per square centimeter , or watts for a given individual lamp assembly , whereas systems used in the context of the curing of coatings often provide readouts in joules per square centimeter
