the signal strength is greater than 10 mv/m at 100 & nbsp ; km ; it is greater than 100 μv/m at 1,000 & nbsp ; km from the transmitter , and thus can be received at not less than this strength throughout the uk the time and date code information begins 43 seconds before the corresponding minute marker ( second 17 of the previous minute , in the absence of leap seconds ) , and is always given in terms of uk civil time , which is utc in winter and utc+1h when summer time is in effect it is set for 61 consecutive minutes , starting 1 hour 7 seconds before the change , and ending 7 seconds before the change , 5 seconds before the first changed bit 58b , which is itself transmitted 2 seconds ( 1.7–1.8 seconds , to be more precise ) before the moment of the time change the other 59 ( or , exceptionally , 60 or 58 ) seconds of the minute always begin with at least 100 ms 'off ' , followed by two data bits of 100 & nbsp ; ms each , and end with at least 700 & nbsp ; ms of carrier currently , the signal is encoded as follows : the msf transmitter is switched off for brief intervals ( on-off keying ) near the beginning of each second to encode the current time and date the formal inauguration of the relocated facility took place on 1 april 2007 , when the name of the service became '' the time from npl '' and the signal from rugby was permanently switched off while at rugby , the transmitter generated 60 & nbsp ; kw of radio frequency power ( using 70 & nbsp ; kw of mains power ) the rugby transmitter 's callsign was msf , where 'm ' is one of the itu prefixes allocated to the united kingdom , and the letters 'sf ' were allocated for no documented reason the second marker is transmitted with an accuracy better than ±1 ms relative to coordinated universal time ( utc ) , which is itself always within ±0.9 seconds of ut1 ( ut1 ) which is the mean solar time which would actually be observed at 0° longitude therefore , unless a leap-second announcement is manually entered into a receiver in advance , it may take some time until an autonomous msf receiver regains synchronization with utc after a leap second ( especially if the reception is not robust at the time of the leap second ) the anthorn station was operated by vt communications from its opening in 2007 until 2010 , when it was acquired by babcock international the transmitted signal has an effective radiated power of 17 kw , on a frequency of 60 khz to within 2 parts in 10 12 this sequence 01111110 never appears elsewhere in the a bits ; due to bcd encoding , at most five consecutive 1 bits can appear elsewhere in the a bits ( bits 27a–31a , on july 30 or 31 , or bits 33a–37a , if a day ending in 7 falls on a saturday ) the 4 parity bits cover years ( 8 bits ) , months and days ( 11 bits ) , day of week ( 3 bits ) , and time of day ( 13 bits ) respectively the official history of rugby radio station according to the npl it seems the call sign was chosen so that it could be memorized as '' master standard frequency '' but msf was not intended to be an abbreviation
