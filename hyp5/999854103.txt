when the piston is forced up or down by bumps in the road , hydraulic fluid moves between different chambers via small holes or '' orifices '' in the piston and via the valve , converting the '' shock '' energy into heat which must then be dissipated one advantage of this type is , by using special internal valving , the absorber may be made relatively soft to compression ( allowing a soft response to a bump ) and relatively stiff to extension , controlling '' rebound '' , which is the vehicle response to energy stored in the springs ; similarly , a series of valves controlled by springs can change the degree of stiffness according to the velocity of the impact or rebound the effect of a shock absorber at high ( sound ) frequencies is usually limited by using a compressible gas as the working fluid or mounting it with rubber bushings or so ) which can actually help it to support some of the vehicle 's weight , something which no other shock absorber is designed to do some shock absorbers allow tuning of the ride via control of the valve by a manual adjustment provided at the shock absorber the result of this alteration is a dramatic reduction in '' foaming '' or '' aeration '' , the undesirable outcome of a twin-tube overheating and failing which presents as foaming hydraulic fluid dripping out of the assembly in most shock absorbers , energy is converted to heat inside the viscous fluid fluid friction , for example the flow of fluid through a narrow orifice ( hydraulics ) , constitutes the vast majority of automotive shock absorbers unlike the shock absorber , the strut has a reinforced body and stem ; strut already plays the role of shocks absorbers , so the shock absorber may well act as part of the strut , not the other way around struts is subjected to multidirectional loads , while the shock absorber only damps vibrations and receive an impact along its axis ; the strut gives to the car greater reliability ; strut and shock absorber have a different way of attachment : compression of a gas , for example pneumatic shock absorbers , which can act like springs as the air pressure is building to resist the force on it as its name implies , the mono-tube shock , which is also a gas-pressurized shock and also comes in a coilover format , consists of only one tube , the pressure tube , though it has two pistons in a psd shock absorber , which still consists of two nested tubes and still contains nitrogen gas , a set of grooves has been added to the pressure tube one of the features of these springs was that the friction between the leaves offered a degree of damping , and in a 1912 review of vehicle suspension , the lack of this characteristic in helical springs was the reason it was '' impossible '' to use them as main springs it also does not have a compression valve , whose role has been taken up by the dividing piston , and although it contains nitrogen gas , the gas in a mono-tube shock is under high pressure ( 260-360 p.s.i although now considered obsolete , an advantage of this system is its mechanical simplicity ; the degree of damping can be easily adjusted by tightening or loosening the screw clamping the disks , and it can be easily rebuilt with simple hand tools shock absorbers use valving of oil and gasses to absorb excess energy from the springs this combines the advantages of gas compressibility and the ability of hydraulic machinery to apply force multiplication the mono-tube shock absorber is consistently a much longer overall design than the twin-tubes , making it difficult to mount in passenger cars designed for twin-tube shocks also known as a '' two-tube '' shock absorber , this device consists of two nested cylindrical tubes , an inner tube that is called the '' working tube '' or the '' pressure tube '' , and an outer tube called the '' reserve tube '' coilover shock absorbers are usually a kind of twin-tube gas charged shock absorber inside the helical road spring thumb left the principal design alternative to the twin-tube form has been the mono-tube shock absorber which was considered a revolutionary advancement when it appeared in the 1950s '' springs - a simple study of car suspension '' , the automotor journal , august 10th , 1912 , pp936-937 however the amount of damping provided by leaf spring friction was limited and variable according to the conditions of the springs , and whether wet or dry there appears to have been little progress on commercialising the lever arm shock absorbers until after world war i , after which they came into widespread use , for example as standard equipment on the 1927 ford model a and manufactured by ralph peo career of buffalo , ny
