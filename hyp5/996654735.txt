in some countries , the terms caller display , calling line identification presentation ( clip ) , call capture , or just calling line identity are used ; call display is the predominant marketing name used in canada ( although some customers still refer to it colloquially as '' caller id '' ) the concept of calling number identification as a service for pots subscribers originated from automatic number identification ( ani ) as a part of toll free number service in the united states in addition to the caller 's telephone number , caller id may also transmit the subscriber 's name , when available if the call originates on a pots line ( a standard loop-start line ) , then caller id is provided by the service provider 's local switch calling line identity ( cli ) localisation is the process of presenting a localised calling line identity to the recipient of a telephone call because a localised cli is displayed on the called party 's device , the call is perceived as local and recognisable to the caller rather than a withheld , unknown or premium rate number in 1968 , theodore paraskevakos , while working in as a communications engineer for sita formerly known as société internationale de télécommunication aéronautique in athens , greece , began developing a system to automatically identify a telephone caller to a call recipient patent 4,551,581/11-5-1985 and patent 4,582,956/4-15-1986 ; ( both assigned to at & t bell laboratories ) thumb in 1971 , paraskevakos , working with boeing in huntsville , alabama , constructed and reduced to practice a transmitter and receiver , representing the world 's first prototypes of caller-identification devices in may 1976 , kazuo hashimoto , a prolific japanese inventor with over one thousand patents worldwide , phonetel patent services : : history : hashimoto first built a prototype of a caller id display device that could receive caller id information patent 4,242,539 , filed originally on may 8 , 1976 , and a resulting patent re-examined at the patent office by at & t , was successfully licensed to most of the major telecommunications and computer companies in the world in 1995 , bellcore released another type of modulation , similar to bell 202 , in which it became possible to transmit caller id information and even provide call-disposition options while the user was already on the telephone this service became known in some markets as call waiting id , or ( when it was combined with call-disposition options ) call waiting deluxe ; it is technically referred to as analog display services interface this class-based pots-telephone calling feature works by combining the services of call waiting with caller id but also introduces an '' options '' feature that , in conjunction with certain screen-based telephones , or other capable equipment , gives a telephone user the option to switch : place the current call on hold to take the second call ( not a new feature ) hang-up : disconnect the current call and take the second call ( not a new feature ) please hold : send the caller either a custom or telephone-company-generated voice message asking the caller to hold forward to voice mail : send the incoming caller to the recipient ’ s voice mail service in the united states , caller id information is sent to the called party by the telephone switch as an analog data stream ( similar to data passed between two modems ) , using bell 202 modulation between the first and second rings , while the telephone unit is still on hook number-only caller id is called single data message format ( sdmf ) , which provides the caller 's telephone number , the date and time of the call name+number caller id is called multiple data message format ( mdmf ) , which in addition to the information provided by sdmf format , can also provide the directory listed name for the particular number instead of sending the caller id in between the first and second ring , some systems ( such as in the uk ) use line reversal to announce the caller id , or caller id signals are simply sent without any announcement in general , cid as transmitted from the origin of the call is only the calling party 's full phone number ( including area code , and including international access code and country code if it 's an international call ) a query ( dip ) with signalling system 7 ( ss7 ) query may be initiated by the called party 's central office to retrieve the information for calling name delivery to the caller id equipment at the subscriber 's location , if the caller 's name has not already been associated with the calling party 's line at the originating central office canadian systems ( depending on the provider ) using ccs7 automatically ( but not in all cases ) send the calling name with the call set-up and routing information at the time of the call to look up the name associated with a phone number , the carrier in some instances has to access that information from a third-party database , and some database providers charge a small fee for each access to such databases to avoid such charges , some carriers will report the name as '' unavailable '' , or will report the name as '' ( city ) , ( state ) '' based on the phone number , particularly for wireless callers most mobile phone providers used the caller id to automatically connect to voice mail when a call to the voice mail number was made from the associated mobile phone number , bypassing the need to enter a password caller id spoofing is the practice of causing the telephone network to display a number on the recipient 's caller id display that is different than that of the actual originating station many telephone services , such as isdn pri based pbx installations , and voice over ip services , permit the caller to configure customized caller id information and according to aaron woolfson , president of telswitch inc , the fee structure for dip fee fraud can include : the carriers pay a fee of 0.003 per call or 300 per 100,000 calls to the database owner the database owner pays the number dealers 0.0024 per call or 240 per 100,000 calls the number dealers share revenue with the robocaller 0.00096 or 96 per 100,000 calls consumers face significant barriers to exiting a call list and often can not have themselves removed from the list ) as a result , not all caller id devices are compatible from country to country or in the same country , even though the basic phone system is the same
