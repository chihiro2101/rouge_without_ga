enrico fermi renamed it the neutrino , italian for '' little neutral one '' , and in 1934 , proposed his fermi 's interaction by which the electrons emitted from the nucleus were created by the decay of a neutron into a proton , an electron , and a neutrino : : → + + the neutrino accounted for the missing energy , but fermi 's theory described a particle with little mass and no electric charge that appeared to be impossible to observe directly '' from then on reines dedicated the major part of his career to the study of the neutrino 's properties and interactions , which work would influence study of the neutrino for future researchers to come in 1944 richard feynman recruited reines to work in the theoretical division at the manhattan project 's los alamos laboratory , where he would remain for the next fifteen years '' according to fermi 's theory , there was also a corresponding reverse reaction , in which a neutrino combines with a proton to create a neutron and a positron : : + → + the positron would soon be annihilated by an electron and produce two 0.51 mev gamma rays , while the neutron would be captured by a proton and release a 2.2 mev gamma ray ironically , reines excelled in literary and history courses , but received average or low marks in science and math in his freshman year of high school , though he improved in those areas by his junior and senior years through the encouragement of a teacher who gave him a key to the school laboratory in 1966 , reines took most of his neutrino research team with him when he left for the new university of california , irvine ( uci ) , becoming its first dean of physical sciences on the basis of his work in first detecting the neutrino , reines became the head of the physics department of case western reserve university from 1959 to 1966 robert oppenheimer memorial prize in 1981 , the national medal of science in 1985 , the bruno rossi prize in 1989 , the michelson–morley award in 1990 , the panofsky prize in 1992 , and the franklin medal in 1992 he later recalled that : the first stirrings of interest in science that i remember occurred during a moment of boredom at religious school , when , looking out of the window at twilight through a hand curled to simulate a telescope , i noticed something peculiar about the light ; it was the phenomenon of diffraction '' reines was accepted into the massachusetts institute of technology , but chose instead to attend stevens institute of technology in hoboken , new jersey , where he earned his bachelor of science ( b.s during this time , besides performing his duties as a research supervisor and chairman of the physics department , reines sang in the cleveland orchestra chorus under the direction of robert shaw in performances with george szell and the cleveland orchestra '' status and aims of the dumand neutrino project : the ocean as a neutrino detector '' , fermi national accelerator laboratory ( fnal ) , united states department of energy ( through predecessor agency the energy research and development administration ) , ( july 1976 ) in 1951 he was the director of operation greenhouse series of nuclear tests in the pacific in 1987 , neutrinos emitted from sn 1987a were detected by the irvine–michigan–brookhaven ( imb ) collaboration , which used an 8,000 ton cherenkov detector located in a salt mine near cleveland '' on the detection of the free neutrino '' , los alamos national laboratory ( lanl ) ( through predecessor agency los alamos scientific laboratory ) , united states department of energy ( through predecessor agency the atomic energy commission ) , ( august 6 , 1953 ) in spite or perhaps because of his role in these nuclear tests , reines was concerned about the dangers of radioactive pollution from atmospheric nuclear tests , and became an advocate of underground nuclear testing at case , he led a group that was the first to detect neutrinos created in the atmosphere by cosmic rays for a time he considered the possibility of a singing career , and was instructed by a vocal coach from the metropolitan opera who provided lessons for free because the family did not have the money for them an outgrowth of the '' demon core second incident '' experiment , the dragon was a machine that could attain a critical state for short bursts of time , which could be used as a research tool or power source
