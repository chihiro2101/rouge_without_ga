two species are accepted : grey parrot , congo grey parrot , african grey parrot or congo african grey parrot ( psittacus erithacus , previously psittacus erithacus erithacus ) : this is the nominate species , larger than the timneh at about long , with light-grey feathers , cherry-red tails , and an all-black beak immature birds of this species have tails with a darker , duller red towards the tip ( juniper and parr 1999 ) until their first moult , which occurs by 18 months of age the congo grey parrot is found on the islands of príncipe and bioko , and is distributed from southeastern ivory coast to western kenya , northwest tanzania , southern democratic republic of the congo ( drc ) , and northern angola timneh parrot or timneh african grey parrot ( psittacus timneh , previously psittacus erithacus timneh ) : the timneh parrot is slightly smaller in size than the congo , but intelligence and talking ability remain comparable timneh parrots are endemic to the western parts of the moist upper guinea forests and bordering savannas of west africa from guinea-bissau , sierra leone , and southern mali east to at least east of the bandama river in ivory coast in 2012 , birdlife international gave the timneh parrot full species status and it was classified as vulnerable the grey parrot has been known to contract beak and feather disease virus ( bfdv ) which causes a highly contagious and sometimes fatal , psittacine beak and feather disease in parrots also acknowledged are claims of captive grey parrots reaching the ages of 73 and 93 , whereas the world parrot trust lists a longevity of 50–60 years for a grey in captivity the guinness book of world records listed a grey parrot that allegedly lived in captivity for 72 years as the longest-lived specimen for the species irene pepperberg 's research with captive greys , most notably with a bird named alex , has scientifically demonstrated that they possess the ability to associate simple human words with meanings , and to intelligently apply the abstract concepts of shape , colour , number , zero-sense , etc in general , it has been shown that grey parrots are able to learn relatively quickly , though they are limited to simple and non-abstract mediums of thinking they have been shown to be able to make cognitive inferences , but , like apes , have inter-individual differences in intelligence one notable grey parrot is n'kisi , which in 2004 was said to have a vocabulary of over 950 words and , like pepperberg 's alex , was noted for creative use of language a study published in 2011 , led by dalila bovet of paris west university nanterre la défense , demonstrated grey parrots were able to coordinate and collaborate with each other to an extent while originally only the great apes and young human children were known to make this association with ease , it was found that grey parrots , under most conditions , can also associate sounds with the presence of an object for the most part , grey parrots performed more successfully if the cup was shaken horizontally before it is given the choice of selecting which contained food , however , further experimentation indicated that it is not a requirement and proved that grey parrots have very high cognitive abilities a grey 's owner should expect to hear regular renditions of microwave ovens , telephones , alarm clocks , video games , and other electronic sounds , as well as dripping water , wild birds , and any other sound often heard by the parrot they also made calls similar to those of other captive grey parrots in different locations and even wild grey parrots a recent analysis suggests up to 21 % of the global population may be taken from the wild annually , primarily for the pet trade , as they are good in talking the
