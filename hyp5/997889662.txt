is that the müller-lyer illusion occurs because the visual system learns that the '' angles in '' configuration corresponds to an rectilinear object , such as the convex corner of a room , which is closer , and the '' angles out '' configuration corresponds to an object which is far away , such as the concave corner of a room according to the so-called centroid hypothesis , judgments of distance between visual objects are strongly affected by the neural computation of the centroids of the luminance profiles of the objects , in that the position of the centroid of an image determines its perceived location sarcone visual explanation of the color spreading effect in the müller-lyer illusion the müller-lyer illusion explained by the statistics of image–source relationships the misplaced illusion ? the case of the mueller-lyer perceptual incongruity figure , 1978 , 69 , 233-241 while this by no means confirms the carpentered world hypothesis as such , it provides evidence that differences in the environment can create differences in the perception of the müller-lyer illusion , even within a given culture the relative displacement of all stimulus terminators leads to misjudgment of distances between them ; that is , the illusion occurs as a side effect due to necessarily low spatial resolution of the neural mechanism of assessment of the relative location of the visual objects in the müller-lyer illusion , the visual system would in this explanation detect the depth cues , which are usually associated with 3d scenes , and incorrectly decide it is a 3d drawing the crucial point in the centroid explanation regarding the positional shifts of the stimulus terminators in the direction of the centroids of contextual flanks was confirmed in psychophysical examination of illusory figures with rotating distractors it is believed now that not '' carpenteredness '' , but the density of pigmentation in the eye is related to susceptibility to the m-l illusion though the integration coarsens the positional acuity , such pooling seems to be quite biologically substantiated since it allows fast and reliable assessment of the location of the visual object as whole , irrespective of its size , the shape complexity , and illumination conditions for the müller-lyer illusion , the mean fractional misperception of the length of the line segments varied from 1.4 % to 20.3 % , an explanation based on past experience with the sources of such stimuli ) , convex and concave corners contribute little if anything to the müller-lyer effect '' they also used the word '' carpentered '' for the environments that europeans mostly live in - characterized by straight lines , right angles , and square corners in 1963 , segall , campbell and herskovitz compared susceptibility to four different visual illusions in three population samples of caucasians , twelve of africans , and one from the philippines
