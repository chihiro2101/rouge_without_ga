snorri sturluson in his heimskringla , in the saga of hákon the good , describes the custom of the bragarfull at feasts : the fire was in the middle of the floor of the temple , and over it hung the kettles , and the full goblets were handed across the fire ; and he who made the feast , and was a godi 'chief ' , blessed the full goblets , and all the meat of the sacrifice bauschatz in 1976 suggested that the term reflects a pagan ritual which had a '' great religious significance in the culture of the early germanic people '' the german word had the same meaning of '' remembrance of absent or departed loved ones '' , but acquired the meaning of '' romantic longing for an unattainable woman of higher status '' in courtly culture , giving rise to the genre of minnesang , and the personification of '' remembrance '' as frau minne 14 all of which translate roughly as '' feast , banquet , ( social ) gathering '' , continue a common germanic sumlan '' banquet '' , which would correspond to a pie '' joint meal '' or '' congregation '' ( literally , symposium or assembly ) the old english noun is usually translated as '' feast '' , and forms various compounds such as symbel-wyn '' joy at feasting '' , symbel-dæg '' feast day '' , symbel-niht '' feast-night '' , symbel-hūs '' feast-house , guest-room '' , symbel-tīd '' feast time '' , symbel-werig '' weary of feasting '' etc in ynglinga saga section of the same work , snorri relates : it was the custom at that time that he who gave an heirship-feast after kings or jarls , and entered upon the heritage , should sit upon the footstool in front of the high seat , until the full bowl , which was called the bragafull , was brought in when the full bragafull came in , king ingjald stood up , grasped a large bull 's horn , and made a solemn vow to enlarge his dominions by one half , towards all the four corners of the world , or die ; and thereupon pointed with the horn to the four quarters the fagrskinna ( a 13th-century history of the kings of norway ) , has a similar account in respect to svein forkbeard , mentioning first ceremonial drinkings dedicated to the greatest of one 's kindred , then to thor or others of the gods the bragarfull '' promise-cup '' or bragafull '' best cup '' or '' chieftain 's cup '' ( compare bragi ) was in norse culture a particular drinking from a cup or drinking horn on ceremonial occasions , often involving the swearing of oaths when the cup or horn was drunk by a chieftain or passed around and drunk by those assembled terms used in this context , both in the eddaic poems and in the sagas , include minnis-öl '' memory-ale '' , minnis-horn '' memory-horn '' , minnis-full '' memory-cup '' , minni-sveig '' memory-draught '' in this version , sumbel is a drinking-ritual in which a drinking horn full of mead or ale is passed around and a series of toasts are made , usually to gods , ancestors , and/or heroes of the religion in theodism or anglo-saxon neopaganism in particular , the symbel has a particularly high importance , considered '' perhaps the highest rite '' or '' amongst the most holy rites '' englatheod.org celebrated paul bauschatz appears to accept sum , sam '' together '' , but proposes that the word represents a compound with alu '' ale '' as its second element ( rather than a suffix ) hervarar saga ok heiðreks relates that hjörvard , the son of arngrim , promised at his bragarfull to wed ingeborg the princess of sweden , and the legends of ragnar lodbrok relate that the geatish jarl herraud promised his daughter to anyone who could liberate her from a dragon or talk to her in its presence then the bragarfull was poured out and when the giver of the feast had drunk this , he was to make a vow , to be also sworn by those present with him , and only then to sit himself on throne of the deceased inspired by bauschatz ' theory from the 1970s , the sumbel has become a central ritual of heathenry in the united states the toasts vary by group , and some groups make a distinction between a '' regular '' sumbel and a '' high '' sumbel , which have different levels of formality , and different rules during toasting in beowulf , a warrior 's boast ( gielp , gylp ) or his oath ( beot ) is often spoken at a feast the prevalent view today is that old english symbel , old saxon symbal , sumbal heliand , line 3340 : '' sittan at sumble '' : on þulr ) appears to act as a royal officiant at the feast which king hrothgar organised for the geatish newcomers , beowulf and his companions 27 it is usually inaugurated by three formal rounds , as determined by the host ; often led by toasts in honor of the gods , then ancestors and/or heroes , and then a general or personal boast 30 the two types of boast are the ȝielp ( pronounced 'yelp ' ) and the beot ( pronounced 'bayawt ' , but as one syllable )
