it is a postulate of modern anthropology , at least since early 1930s , that there is complete continuity between magic and religion according to them , religion is the expression of a social structure and serves to maintain the cohesion of a community ( religion is therefore public ) and magic is an individualistic action ( and therefore private ) defined the differences between religion and magic : '' 'religion ' is used to indicate the belief in supernatural or spiritual beings ; 'magic ' , the use of practices intended to bring occult forces under control and so to influence events ; 'ritual ' , prescribed or customary behaviour that may be religious , if it is intended to placate or win favour of supernatural beings , magical if it is intended to operate through impersonal forces of sympathy or by controlling supernatural beings , or social if its purpose is to reinforce a social organisation or facilitate social intercourse '' in 1991 henk versnel argued that magic and religion function in different ways and that these can be broadly defined in four areas : intention - magic is employed to achieve clear and immediate goals for an individual , whereas religion is less purpose-motivated and has its sights set on longer-term goals ; attitude – magic is manipulative as the process is in the hands of the user , “ instrumental coercive manipulation ” , opposed to the religious attitude of “ personal and supplicative negotiation ” ; action – magic is a technical exercise that often requires professional skills to fulfil an action , whereas religion is not dependent upon these factors but the will and sentiment of the gods ; social – the goals of magic run counter to the interests of a society ( in that personal gain for an individual gives them an unfair advantage over peers ) , whereas religion has more benevolent and positive social functions this may have been long ago , as a folk tradition that died out with the establishment of a major world religion , such as judaism , christianity , islam or buddhism , or it may still co-exist with that world religion this belief is reflected in traditional wicca , where the names of the goddess and the horned god - the two supreme deities in wicca - are usually held as a secret to be revealed only to initiates this belief is also reflected in ancient judaism , which used the tetragrammaton ( yhwh , usually translated as '' lord '' in small caps ) to refer to god in the tanakh the same belief is seen in hinduism , but with different conclusions ; rather , attaining transcendence and the power of god is seen as a good thing on the other hand , seemingly magical signs are documented in the bible : for example , both the staff of pharaoh 's sorcerers as well as the staff of moses and aaron could be turned into snakes ( exodus 7:8-13 ) however , as scott noegel points out , the critical difference between the magic of pharaoh 's magicians and the non-magic of moses is in the means by which the staff becomes a snake
