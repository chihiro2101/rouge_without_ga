a united states geological survey ( usgs ) study found a significant long-term trend over the 20th century for non-renewable resources such as minerals to supply a greater proportion of the raw material inputs to the non-fuel , non-food sector of the economy ; an example is the greater consumption of crushed stone , sand , and gravel used in construction the main issues that arise when trying to do so are , determining a suitable unit of account , deciding how to deal with '' collective '' nature of a complete ecosystem , delineating the borderline of the ecosystem and defining the extent of possible duplication when the resource interacts in more than one ecosystem economists want to measure resource depletion to understand how financially reliant countries or corporations are on non-renewable resources , whether this use can be sustained and the financial drawbacks of switching to renewable resources in light of the depleting resources if a wetland is in between an agricultural zone and a freshwater ecosystem , fertilizer runoff will be absorbed by the wetland and used to fuel the slow processes that occur happen , by the time the water reaches the freshwater ecosystem there wo n't be enough fertilizer to cause destructive algal blooms that poison freshwater ecosystems there are two different perspectives to groundwater depletion , the first is that depletion is considered literally and simply as a reduction in the volume of water in the saturated zone , regardless of water quality considerations groundwater supplies wells and aquifers for private , agricultural , and public use and is used by more than a third of the world 's population every day for their drinking water groundwater is considered to be a non-renewable resource because less than six percent of the water around the world is replenished and renewed on a human timescale of 50 years for most people , a forest has no value when its resources are not being used , so the incentives to deforest these areas outweigh the incentives to preserve the forests hydrologic alteration drainage dredging stream channelization ditching levees deposition of fill material diversion dam groundwater drainage dam urbanization and urban development marinas/boats industrialization and industrial development agriculture silviculture/timber harvest mining atmospheric deposition to preserve the resources extracted from wetlands , current strategies are to rank wetlands and prioritize the conservation of wetlands with more environmental services , create more efficient irrigation for wetlands being used for agriculture and restricting access to wetlands by tourists the united nations and the world bank created programs such as reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation ( redd ) , which works especially with developing countries to use subsidies or other incentives to encourage citizens to use the forest in a more sustainable way diamond , jared collapse : how societies choose to fail or succeed ; viking press 2004 , pages 301â€“302 the new york declaration on forests and its associated actions promotes reforestation , which is being encouraged in many countries in an attempt to repair the damage that deforestation has done because deforestation is so extensive , it has made several significant impacts on the environment , including : carbon dioxide in the atmosphere changing the water cycle an increase in soil erosion a decrease in biodiversity deforestation and global warming depletion accounting factors in several different influences such as the number of years until resource exhaustion , the cost of resource extraction and the demand of the resource it is estimated that 80 % of the world 's known biodiversity lives in the rainforests , and the destruction of these rainforests is accelerating extinction at an alarming rate wetlands are ecosystems that are often saturated by enough surface or groundwater to sustain vegetation that is usually adapted to saturated soil conditions , such as cattails , bulrushes , red maples , wild rice , blackberries , cranberry , and peat moss environmentalists are interested in depletion accounting as a way to track the use of natural resources over time , hold governments accountable or to compare their environmental conditions to those of another country because some varieties of wetlands are rich in minerals and nutrients and provide many of the advantages of both land and water environments they contain diverse species and provide a distinct basis for the food chain for depletion accounting to work , appropriate units of natural resources must be established so that natural resources can be viable in the market economy due to this increase in depletion , in some of the most depleted areas use of groundwater for irrigation has become impossible or cost prohibitive january 4 , 2006 it occurs for many different reasons , and it has several negative implications on the atmosphere and the quality of the land in and surrounding the forest the 2005 hirsch report concluded that the decreased supply combined with increasing demand will significantly increase the worldwide prices of petroleum derived products , and that most significant will be the availability and price of liquid fuel for transportation
