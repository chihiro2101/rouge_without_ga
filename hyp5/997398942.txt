using circular needles has some advantages , for example , the weight of the fabric is more evenly distributed , therefore less taxing , on the arms and wrists of the knitter and , the length of the cable may be longer than would be practical with rigid needles since the cable and fabric rest in the lap of the knitter rather than extending straight out past the arms one common method is to use two needles in place of the four or five double-pointed needles traditionally used , while a newer technique is to use one circular needle that is significantly longer than the circumference of the item being knitted the lack of a purl row in stockinette stitch , since in the round ( commonly referred to as itr ) knitting is all done using the knit stitch , is often perceived to be one of the greatest benefits of itr most needles come with the size written on them , but with use and time , the label often wears off , and many needles ( like double-pointed needles ) tend not to be labelled such needles are always used in pairs and are usually 10-16 inches ( 25.4–40.6 & nbsp ; cm ) long but , due to the compressibility of knitted fabrics , may be used to knit pieces significantly wider in addition to common wood and metal needles , antique knitting needles were sometimes made from tortoiseshell , ivory and walrus tusks ; these materials are now banned due to their impact on endangered species , and needles made from them are virtually impossible to find there are holes of various sizes through which the needles are passed to determine which hole they fit best , and often a ruler along the edge for determining the tension ( also called gauge ) of a sample the two tapered ends , typically 4–5 inches ( 10.5–13 & nbsp ; cm ) long , are rigid , allowing for easy knitting , and are connected by the flexible strand ( usually made of nylon or coated wire ) a cable needle is a special type of double-pointed needle that is typically very short and used to hold a very small number of stitches temporarily while the knitter is forming a cable pattern additionally , circulars eliminate the need to continually switch from one needle to the next , and there is no possibility of stitches falling off the back end of the needles , as may happen when using dpns construction of garments such as sweaters may be greatly simplified when knitting itr , since the finishing steps of sewing a back , two fronts , and two sleeves of a sweater together may be almost entirely eliminated in neck down itr knitting it is a slender , straight stick tapered to a point at one end , with a knob at the other end to prevent stitches from slipping off double-pointed needles are somewhat shorter than single-pointed or circular needles , and are usually used in the 13–20 & nbsp ; cm length range , although they are also made longer the origin of the numbering system is uncertain but it is thought that needle numbers were based on the number of increasingly fine dies that the wire had to be drawn through
