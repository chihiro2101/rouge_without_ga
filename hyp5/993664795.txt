the papacy first used this title in the 6th century ; earlier they used the title '' vicar of saint peter '' or vicarius principis apostolorum , the '' vicar of the chief of the apostles '' vicar general , episcopal vicars , and judicial vicars exercise vicarious ordinary power ; they each exercise a portion of the power of the diocesan bishop ( judicial for the judicial vicar , executive for the others ) by virtue of their office and not by virtue of a mandate a vicar forane , also known as an archpriest or dean , is a priest entrusted by the bishop with a certain degree of leadership in a territorial division of a diocese or a pastoral region known as a vicarate forane or a deanery in the russian orthodox church and some other non-hellenic eastern orthodox churches that historically follow russian tradition , vicar ( russian : vikariy / викарий ) is a term for what is known as suffragan bishop in the anglican communion or as auxiliary bishop in the latin rite of the roman catholic church for example , ignaty punin , the vicar bishop under the diocese of smolensk , is titled '' the rt revd ignaty , the bishop of vyazma , the vicar of the diocese of smolensk '' , vyasma being a smaller town inside the territory of the diocese of smolensk roughly speaking , the distinction was that a rector directly received both the greater and lesser tithes of his parish while a vicar received only the lesser tithes ( the greater tithes going to the lay holder , or impropriator , of the living ) ; a perpetual curate with a small cure and often aged or infirm received neither greater nor lesser tithes , and received only a small salary ( paid sometimes by the diocese ) in the evangelical lutheran church in america , the lutheran church–missouri synod , the lutheran church–canada , and the wisconsin evangelical lutheran synod , a vicar is a candidate for ordained pastoral ministry , serving in a vicariate or internship , usually in the third year of seminary training , though it can be delayed to the fourth year ( this is often referred to as '' a vicarage '' , a homonym of the residence of the vicar ) the title '' vikar '' , used in the lutheran churches in germany , is comparable while the lutheran church of sweden calls it '' kyrkoherde '' ( '' church shepherd '' ) , although that title is more comparable to a rector the 18th-century satirical ballad '' the vicar of bray '' reveals the changes of conscience a vicar ( whether of the bray , berkshire or of that in county wicklow ) might undergo in order to retain his meagre post , between the 1680s and 1720s
