the earliest modes of operation , ecb , cbc , ofb , and cfb ( see below for all ) , date back to 1981 and were specified in fips 81 , des modes of operation in 2001 , the us national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) revised its list of approved modes of operation by including aes as a block cipher and adding ctr mode in sp800-38a , recommendation for block cipher modes of operation the block cipher modes ecb , cbc , ofb , cfb , ctr , and xts provide confidentiality , but they do not protect against accidental modification or malicious tampering hmac was approved in 2002 as fips 198 , the keyed-hash message authentication code ( hmac ) , cmac was released in 2005 under sp800-38b , recommendation for block cipher modes of operation : the cmac mode for authentication , and gmac was formalized in 2007 under sp800-38d , recommendation for block cipher modes of operation : galois/counter mode ( gcm ) and gmac an initialization vector ( iv ) or starting variable ( sv ) is a block of bits that is used by several modes to randomize the encryption and hence to produce distinct ciphertexts even if the same plaintext is encrypted multiple times , without the need for a slower re-keying process this can be seen because both modes effectively create a bitstream that is xored with the plaintext , and this bitstream is dependent on the key and iv only in cbc mode , the iv must be unpredictable ( random or pseudorandom ) at encryption time ; in particular , the ( previously ) common practice of re-using the last ciphertext block of a message as the iv for the next message is insecure ( for example , this method was used by ssl 2.0 ) if an attacker knows the iv ( or the previous block of ciphertext ) before the next plaintext is specified , they can check their guess about plaintext of some block that was encrypted with the same key before ( this is known as the tls cbc iv attack ) synthetic initialization vector ( siv ) synthesize an internal iv by running an pseudo-random function ( prf ) construction called s2v on the input ( additional data and plaintext ) , preventing any external data from directly controlling the iv a block cipher works on units of a fixed size ( known as a block size ) , but messages come in a variety of lengths the simplest is to add null bytes to the plaintext to bring its length up to a multiple of the block size , but care must be taken that the original length of the plaintext can be recovered ; this is trivial , for example , if the plaintext is a c style string which contains no null bytes except at the end slightly more complex is the original des method , which is to add a single one bit , followed by enough zero bits to fill out the block ; if the message ends on a block boundary , a whole padding block will be added cfb , ofb and ctr modes do not require any special measures to handle messages whose lengths are not multiples of the block size , since the modes work by xoring the plaintext with the output of the block cipher the last partial block of plaintext is xored with the first few bytes of the last keystream block , producing a final ciphertext block that is the same size as the final partial plaintext block this characteristic of stream ciphers makes them suitable for applications that require the encrypted ciphertext data to be the same size as the original plaintext data , and for applications that transmit data in streaming form where it is inconvenient to add padding bytes like all counter modes , this is essentially a stream cipher , and so it is essential that a different iv is used for each stream that is encrypted s2v is a keyed hash is based on cmac , and the input to the function is : additional authenticated data ( zero , one or many aad fields are supported ) plaintext authentication key ( k aes-gcm-siv is a mode of operation for the advanced encryption standard which provides similar performance to galois/counter mode as well as misuse resistance in the event of the reuse of a cryptographic nonce the inputs of the listed modes are summarized in the following table : ( source : sp800-38a table d.2 : summary of effect of bit errors on decryption ) it might be observed , for example , that a one-block error in the transmitted ciphertext would result in a one-block error in the reconstructed plaintext for ecb mode encryption , while in cbc mode such an error would affect two blocks many modes use an initialization vector ( iv ) which , depending on the mode , may have requirements such as being only used once ( a nonce ) or being unpredictable ahead of its publication , etc reusing an iv with the same key in ctr , gcm or ofb mode results in xoring the same keystream with two or more plaintexts , a clear misuse of a stream , with a catastrophic loss of security deterministic authenticated encryption modes such as the nist key wrap algorithm and the siv ( rfc 5297 ) aead mode do not require an iv as an input , and return the same ciphertext and authentication tag every time for a given plaintext and key other iv misuse-resistant modes such as aes-gcm-siv benefit from an iv input , for example in the maximum amount of data that can be safely encrypted with one key , while not failing catastrophically if the same iv is used multiple times
