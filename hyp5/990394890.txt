mike disher , '' breguet at the louvre '' , watchtime.com , 29 july 2009 his achievements soon attracted a wealthy and influential clientele that comprised a veritable '' who 's who '' of the period : louis xvi and his queen marie antoinette , napoleon , joséphine de beauharnais , louis xviii , alexander i of russia , george iv of the united kingdom , arthur wellesley , 1st duke of wellington '' circa 1807 breguet brought in his son , antoine-louis ( born 1776 ) as a business partner , and from this point the firm became known as breguet et fils salomons , 1921 , p.7 breguet had previously sent his son to london to study with the great english chronometer maker , john arnold , and such was the mutual friendship and respect between the two men that arnold , in turn , sent his son , john roger , to spend time with breguet through his role as tutor to the dukes of angoulême and de berri , abbé marie was able to arrange for breguet to be introduced to king louis xvi of france , and the king 's interest in mechanics led to many royal commissions for the rising watchmaker , including a perpetuelle ( automatic watch ) , with which the king was especially pleased just before he died in 2004 , diller had confessed his crime to his wife , nili shamrat , and in august 2006 she attempted to sell a batch of the stolen items ( including the '' marie antoinette '' watch and a breguet '' sympathique '' clock ) back to the museum , although her initial asking price of 2 & nbsp ; million was eventually cut down to just us 35,000 he and his bride , cécile marie-louise l'huillier , set up their home and the breguet watchmaking company ; its first known address was at 51 , quai de l'horloge in the île de la cité in paris ( by the 1920s this location was designated as 39 ) it is recorded that if a workman came to breguet with a finished piece of work and an invoice for payment , and breguet was satisfied with the work , then if the invoice ended in a zero , breguet would add a tail to the zero to make it a ' 9 ' , thereby enabling the workman to be paid nine francs more than he had asked for in 1921 he published the seminal volume , breguet 1747–1823 , the first major book on the subject , which included a biography , an analysis of breguet 's key inventions , listings of major pieces , and a detailed timeline of production , using examples from his own unique collection for illustrations he returned to paris overflowing with the ideas that produced the breguet balance-spring , his first carriage clock ( sold to house of bonaparte ) , the sympathique clock and its dependent watch , the tact watch , and finally the tourbillon , patented in 1801 he declared the newly discovered breguet to be the greatest watch he had ever seen in his 28 years with the programme , and assessed its value as at least uk£50,000 , although it may be worth considerably more – another example sold for us 288,000 , while a montre à tact of very similar design , commissioned by napoleon 's wife joséphine de beauharnais for her sister hortense , was sold by christie 's in geneva for us 1.3 & nbsp ; million in 2007 the young breguet soon '' astonished '' his master with his aptitude and intelligence , and to further his education he took evening classes in mathematics at the collège mazarin under abbé marie , who became a friend and mentor to the young watchmaker even by the standards of the day it was an astronomically expensive piece ; the commission specifically called for every watch function and complication known at that time and the use of the most valuable materials ( including gold , platinum , rubies and sapphires ) , with no limit placed on time or cost salomons ' biography records that marat and breguet were at the house of a mutual friend one day when an angry crowd gathered outside , shouting '' down with marat ! '' , but breguet contrived their escape by disguising marat as an old woman , and they left the house arm in arm , unmolested david salomons , breguet 1747-1823 ( privately published , 1921 ) , p.46 breguet 's most remarkable piece anticipated the wristwatch by a century ; he designed this , together with his friend john arnold , for caroline bonaparte , queen of naples , in 1810 over his lifetime , salomons amassed the world 's largest private breguet collection , which ultimately grew to 124 pieces , including what are considered to be the two greatest examples of breguet 's watchmaking work – the '' marie antionette '' and the double-faced '' duc de praslin '' watches in fact , it was commissioned in 1783 by a member of the marie-antoinette guards , possibly as a gift for the queen , and it took almost twenty years to complete—work stopped for around seven years ( 1789–1795 ) during the period of breguet 's exile—and it was not finished until around 1802 in 1980 , british master horologist george daniels ( widely regarded as the most important watchmaker since breguet ) catalogued the breguet watches and clocks in the museum , and published a study on them after antoine-louis retired in 1833 ( he died in 1858 ) the business continued under abraham-louis ' grandson louis-françois-clement breguet ( 1804–1883 ) ; his great-grandson louis antoine ( 1851–1882 ) was the last of the breguet family to run the business this was done by turning the front disc clockwise until it went no further ( because of the cam inside ) and then feeling at which hour marker ( indicated by the surrounding circle of jewels ) the watch hand was positioned in 1793 marat discovered that breguet was marked for the guillotine , possibly because of his friendship with abbé marie ( and/or his association with the royal court ) ; in return for his own earlier rescue , marat arranged for a safe-pass that enabled breguet to escape to switzerland , from where he travelled to england the mechanism cover bore the engraved signature of breguet and also bore the mark of recordon , his london agent at the time ( suggesting that it was originally made for an english client ) the '' marie antoinette '' remained in the possession of the breguet company until it was sold to sir spencer brunton in 1887 , eventually finding its way into the collection of breguet expert david lionel goldsmid-stern-salomons in the 1920s salomons left the remainder of the collection to his wife , who eventually sold them at auction , although according to one account , she was initially rebuffed when she approached sotheby 's , because the staffer with whom she dealt could not believe that someone '' off the street '' could possibly have amassed such a collection by the year of breguet 's death in 1823 the firm also had a shop at 4 , place de la bourse , which is known because both addresses appear on the label of watch 4004 when police searched the couple 's los angeles home , more of the missing items were found , and documents recovered led them to safes and storage units in france , the netherlands and israel ; by 2008 all but ten of the items diller stole from the mayer museum had been recovered tattet had a showroom in paris ; the family tried for some time to entice the young breguet into the trade , to no avail , but he eventually took to it with great interest and in 1762 , aged 15 , he was sent to be apprenticed to an unknown versailles master watchmaker the duke showed arnold a clock made by breguet , who was so impressed that he immediately travelled to paris and asked breguet to accept his son as an apprentice
