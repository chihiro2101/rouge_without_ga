a covert channel is so called because it is hidden from the access control mechanisms of secure operating systems since it does not use the legitimate data transfer mechanisms of the computer system ( typically , read and write ) , and therefore can not be detected or controlled by the security mechanisms that underlie secure operating systems a covert channel is created by a sender process that modulates some condition ( such as free space , availability of some service , wait time to execute ) that can be detected by a receiving process for example , a file can be opened and closed by a program in a specific , timed pattern that can be detected by another program , and the pattern can be interpreted as a string of bits , forming a covert channel the detection of a covert channel can be made more difficult by using characteristics of the communications medium for the legitimate channel that are never controlled or examined by legitimate users the tcsec defines two kinds of covert channels : storage channels - communicate by modifying a '' storage location '' , such as a hard drive the tcsec ( tcsec ) was a set of criteria , now deprecated , that had been established by the national computer security center , an agency managed by the united states ' national security agency assuming block of various sizes are transmitted on the lan , software overhead is computed on average and novel time evaluation is used to estimate the bandwidth ( capacity ) of covert channels are also presented covert channels are distinct from , and often confused with , legitimate channel exploitations that attack low-assurance pseudo-secure systems using schemes such as steganography or even less sophisticated schemes to disguise prohibited objects inside of legitimate information objects moreover , the usages of sequence number field as well as the acknowledgment field can not be made specific to the ascii coding of english language alphabet as proposed , since both fields take into account the receipt of data bytes pertaining to specific network packet ( s ) lampson 's definition of a covert channel was paraphrased in the tcsec ncsc-tg-030 , covert channel analysis of trusted systems ( light pink book ) , 1993 from the united states department of defense ( dod ) rainbow series publications requires analysis of covert storage channels to be classified as a b2 system and analysis of covert timing channels is a requirement for class b3 for instance , a case where sequence number field of tcp header is manipulated , the encoding scheme is adopted such that every time the same alphabet is covertly communicated , it is encoded with the same sequence number in the same way , the other obvious storage covert channel would depend on the size of the frame sent by the sender the covert information according to girling can be communicated through any of following obvious ways : by observing the addresses as approached by the transmitter besides suggesting the use of the reserved fields of protocols headers ( that are easily detectable ) at higher network layers , they also propose the possibility of timing channels involving csma/cd manipulation at the physical layer ordinary things , such as existence of a file or time used for a computation , have been the medium through which a covert channel communicates
