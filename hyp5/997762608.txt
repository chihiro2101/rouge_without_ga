according to melchiori , scholars have often assumed that this play , the title of which was not stated in the letter of 15 april 1598 from george nicolson ( elizabeth i 's edinburgh agent ) to lord burghley noting the public unrest , was a comedy ( one that does not survive ) , but the play 's portrayal of scots is so virulent that it is likely that the play was banned—officially or unofficially—and left forgotten by heminges and condell countess of salisbury – salisbury 's wife ( although the story of edward iii 's infatuation with her is based on an incident involving alice of norfolk , salisbury 's sister-in-law ) see melchiori , 186 earl of warwick – her father ( fictitiously ) sir william montague – salisbury 's nephew earl of derby lord audley – portrayed as an old man , though he was historically no older than 30 at the time of the play lord percy john copland – esquire , later sir john copland lodwick or lodowick – king edward 's secretary two esquires herald supporters of the english robert iii of artois – partially based on sir godfrey de harcourt ;

the action of edward i dramatizes the creation of the title of prince of wales ( of which the black prince was only the third holder ) ; while the battle of alcazar dramatizes sixteenth-century warfare—the anachronistic model for the battle narratives in edward iii , with their pikes and naval gunnery in 1760 , noted shakespearean editor edward capell included the play in his prolusions ;

cambridge university press published an edition two years later as part of its new cambridge shakespeare series they note proudfoot and bennet , 86 that the only reference to froissart in all of shakespeare 's canonical work is in the first act of henry vi , part 1 , which many scholars now attribute to nashe following this , the bbc broadcast an abridged version of the play in 1963 , with complete performances taking place in los angeles in 1986 ( as part of a season of shakespeare apocrypha ) and mold in 1987 forker 's analysis of the troublesome reign of king john ( 2011 ) assesses that anonymous play as being by george peele , and edward iii as stylistically different from that of peele proudfoot and bennett , 84 marcus dahl did n-gram research on nashe 's works and found seven links in summer 's last will and testament , 24 links in christ 's tears over jerusalem , thirteen links in the unfortunate traveller , and four links in the terrors of the night 3 was the raigne of king edward lll a compliment to lord hunsdon ? has argued that the playwright had access to lord hunsdon 's personal copy of froissart and quoted some of hunsdon 's annotations other notable features included by artistic director jon ciccarelli were a viking party scene that bridged the edward-countess meeting scene with the lodowick monologue and included an historical dramatization of edward 's founding of the '' order of the garter '' stressing the mutual attraction between edward ( ben forer ) and the countess ( rachel matusewicz ) the english king edward iii queen philippa – his wife edward , the black prince – their son earl of salisbury – partially based on sir walter de manny ;
