bonitto , brian ( 2012 ) '' king tubby , the sound creator '' , jamaica observer , 6 july 2012 , retrieved 13 july 2012 it became a crowd favourite due to the high quality sound of his equipment , exclusive releases and tubby 's own echo and reverb sound effects , at that point something of a novelty king tubby 's production work in the 1970s made him one of the best-known celebrities in jamaica , and would generate interest in his production techniques from producers , sound engineers and musicians across the world when tubby was asked to produce versions of songs for sound system mcs or toasters , tubby initially worked to remove the vocal tracks with the faders on reid 's mixing desk , but soon discovered that the various instrumental tracks could be accentuated , reworked and emphasised through the settings on the mixer and primitive early effects units partly due to the popularity of these early remixes , in 1971 , tubby 's soundsystem consolidated its position as one of the most popular in kingston and tubby decided to open a studio of his own in waterhouse in 1971 , initially using a 4-track mixer purchased from byron lee 's dynamic studio with a variety of effects units connected to his mixer , tubby '' played '' the mixing desk like an instrument , bringing instruments and vocals in and out of the mix ( literally '' dubbing '' them ) to create an entirely new genre known as dub music by the later part of the 1970s , king tubby had mostly retired from music , still occasionally mixing dubs and tutoring a new generation of artists , including king jammy and perhaps his greatest protege , hopeton brown a.k.a he built a new , larger studio in the waterhouse neighbourhood of kingston with increased capabilities , and focused on the management of his labels firehouse , waterhouse , kingston 11 , and taurus , which released his productions of anthony red rose , sugar minott , conroy smith , king everald and other popular musicians as a talented radio repairman , tubby soon found himself in great demand by most of the major sound systems of kingston , as the tropical weather of the caribbean island ( often combined with sabotage by rival sound system owners ) led to malfunctions and equipment failure tubby built on his considerable knowledge of electronics to repair , adapt and design his own studio equipment , which made use of a combination of old devices and new technologies to produce a studio capable of the precise , atmospheric sounds which would become tubby 's trademark it is unlikely that a complete discography of tubby 's production work could be created based on the number of labels , artists and producers with whom he worked , and also subsequent repressings of these releases sometimes contained contradictory information
