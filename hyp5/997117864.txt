a '' writ of prohibition '' , in the united states , is an official legal document drafted and issued by a supreme court , superior court or an appeals court to a judge presiding over a suit in an inferior court the writ of prohibition mandates the inferior court to cease any action over the case because it may not fall within that inferior court 's jurisdiction in criminal proceedings , a defendant who has been committed for trial may petition the superior court for a writ of prohibition , in this case on the ground that his conduct , even if proven , does not constitute the offense charged a writ of prohibition is issued primarily to prevent an inferior court or tribunal from exceeding its jurisdiction in cases pending before it or acting contrary to the rules of natural justice it is issued by a superior court to inferior courts from usurping a jurisdiction with which it was not legally vested , or in other words to compel inferior courts to keep within the limits of their jurisdiction it is a collateral matter progress essentially between the two tribunals , an inferior one and other superior one by which the latter , by virtue its power of superintendence over the former , restrains it within its rightful competence when the court , before whom the matter is pending , has ceased to exist , in that condition too , the writ of prohibition will not lie because there can be no proceedings upon which it can operate but on the other hand , if the court is functioning , the writ can be issued at any stage of the proceeding before the inferior court or tribunal while the earlier courts had had more flexibility to provide both legal and equitable relief , over the period from the late thirteenth century to the end of the fourteenth century , the consideration of equity gradually disappeared in common law courts , which was one of the reasons the chancery , which existed before to keep the king ’ s great seal and stamp it on public documents , emerged as a separate judicial court in the first half of the fifteenth century , litigants chose to bring their cases there because , despite its growing popularity , the chancery still saw many fewer cases than the common law court , which allowed cases to be resolved more quickly than in the common law courts , which were known for being slow that meant that if a party wanted to halt proceedings in another court on the grounds that the presiding court did not have proper jurisdictional authority , the party would petition the managing courts to do one of the following things : ( 1 ) eliminate liability altogether by applying common law , ( 2 ) have the case be sued de novo at common law , or ( 3 ) secure trial by the common law method of a jury or judicial ruling prior to deciding whether or not to grant the writ , the managing court would usually allow for open-court debate between the plaintiff seeking prohibition , the defendant opposing prohibition , and/or the judges themselves if the chancellor agreed , he could issue a writ of consultation , reversing the writ of prohibition and allowing the case to continue in the ecclesiastical court in the church 's eyes , the right of the executor to collect debts from a decedent 's debtors and the right of creditors to enforce theirs claims against a decedent ’ s estate were '' a proper part of probate administration ''
