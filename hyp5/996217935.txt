napier made a wide variety of products , including a centrifuge for sugar manufacturing , lathes and drills , ammunition-making equipment for the royal arsenal , woolwich , and railway cranes & nbsp ; 1438 david 's younger son james murdoch , born 1823 , joined the firm in 1837 and became a partner in 1847 , resulting in a change in the private company 's name to d james succeeded his father as head of the firm in 1867 , and after his father 's death in 1873 , specialized in crafted precision machinery for making coins , printing stamps and banknotes & nbsp ; 1485 edge was sufficiently impressed to encourage napier to make his own car and collaborated with harvey du cros , his former boss at dunlop , to form the motor power company , based in london , which agreed to buy napier 's entire output the first of an initial order of six , three each two-cylinder 8 & nbsp ; hp and four-cylinder 16 & nbsp ; hp , all with aluminum bodies by arthur mulliner of northampton and chain drive , was delivered 31 march 1900 ; edge paid £400 and sold at £500 in spring , edge entered an 8 & nbsp ; hp ( 6 & nbsp ; kw ) napier in the thousand miles ( 1,600 & nbsp ; km ) trial of the automobile club on behalf of mary eliza kennard ; driven by edge , with kennard along , on a circuit from newbury to edinburgh and back , it won its class , being one of only thirty-five finishers ( of sixty-four starters wise ( 1974 ) ) and one of just twelve to average the requisite 12 & nbsp ; mph ( 19 & nbsp ; km/h ) in england and 10 & nbsp ; mph ( 16 & nbsp ; km/h ) in scotland by june 1900 , eight '' 16 hp '' s had been ordered , and edge entered one in the 837 & nbsp ; mi ( 1,350 & nbsp ; km ) paris-toulouse-paris race , with charles rolls ( co-founder of rolls-royce ) as riding mechanic wise ( 1974 ) for 1901 , montague designed a car sure not to lack speed , having a 16.3-litre ( 995.5 cu in ) ( 165.1×190.5 & nbsp ; mm , 6.5×7.5 in ) sidevalve four capable of at 800 rpm , on a wheelbase of 115 & nbsp ; inches ( 2.921 & nbsp ; m ) wise ( 1974 ) with four-speed gearbox and chain drive edge entered one in the 1901 gordon bennett cup , only able to test it en route ( it was completed 25 may , only four days before the event ) , montague serving as his riding mechanic ; it overpowered its dunlops , and fitting new ( french ) tires led to disqualification , since they were not of the same nation of origin for the 1902 gordon bennett , three entrants ( the charron-girardot-voigt , a mors and a panhard ) contested for france , with edge in a napier and two wolseleys the napier was a three-speed , shaft-drive 6.44-litre ( 392.7 cu in ) four ( 127×127 & nbsp ; mm , 5x5 in ) of 44.5 & nbsp ; hp ( 33 & nbsp ; kw ) ( though described as a 30 & nbsp ; hp ) piloted by edge and his cousin , cecil , it wore what would become known as british racing green , and won at an average 31.8 & nbsp ; mph ( 51.2 & nbsp ; km/h ) ; although by default , since all other entrants retired during the race on 16 october of that year , napier announced a six-cylinder car for 1904 and became the first manufacturer to make a commercially successful six , a '' remarkably smooth and flexible '' vehicle 18 & nbsp ; hp 301 cu in ( 4.9-litre ) ( 101.6×101.6 & nbsp ; mm , 4×4 in ) with a three-speed gearbox and chain drive ( london : grange-universal , 1985 ) napier 's 1902 win brought the gordon bennett hosting duties to the united kingdom , and the 1903 event was held south of dublin , with three shaft-driven napiers defending the british and irish honor , all in the ( later famous ) racing green : two 470 cubic inch ( 7708 & nbsp ; cc ) 45 & nbsp ; horsepower ( 33.5 & nbsp ; kw ) fours for charles jarrott and j hull ( 1974 ) it was a bad year for napier 's racing program ; a 35 & nbsp ; hp in the hands of colonel mark mayhew in the paris-madrid rally lost its steering and hit a tree edge , again with mcdonald , fared no better with the k5 in the 1904 gordon bennett in germany , but a new 920 cubic inch ( 15-litre ; 158.7×127 & nbsp ; mm , 6.25×5-inch ) six , the l48 , with an external radiator reminiscent of the cord 810 , set the fastest time at the velvet strand speed trials at portmarnock , ireland , in september , piloted by mcdonald 1,489 in january 1905 , the l48 , again with mcdonald in the seat , took the mile ( 1.6 & nbsp ; km ) record at daytona beach at 104.65 & nbsp ; mph ( 168.41 & nbsp ; km/h ) ; although this was shortly broken by bowden 's mercedes , the run was disallowed edge 's secretary , dorothy levitt , drove a 100 & nbsp ; hp ( 74.6 & nbsp ; kw ) development of the k5 at the blackpool and brighton speed trials in 1905 , and the next year ran the l48 at the blackpool speed trials , showing talent by equalling edge 's speed and setting a women 's record in the flying kilometre of 90.88 & nbsp ; mph ( 146.25 & nbsp ; km/h ) tryon won the first ever event in a , and edge made a famous 24-hour run in june , covering 1,581 & nbsp ; miles ( 2,544 & nbsp ; km ) at an average 65.905 & nbsp ; mph ( 106.06 & nbsp ; km/h ) in a 60-horsepower 589 cubic inch ( 9,652 & nbsp ; cc ) ( 127×127 & nbsp ; mm , 5×5-inch ) six , a record which stood for 18 & nbsp ; years the l48 , nicknamed samson , became famous there in the venue 's first two years ; in 1908 , napier 's frank newton covered half a mile ( 800 & nbsp ; m ) at 119.34 & nbsp ; mph ( 190.05 & nbsp ; km/h ) in a stroked ( 178 & nbsp ; mm , 7-inch ) l48 the company 's last race win was with a four-cylinder at the 1908 tourist trophy , using an alias , hutton , to preserve the reputation of the sixes , in the hands of willy watson when napier was no longer in racing , its lion aero engine was used by several land speed record contestants : malcolm campbell 's napier-campbell blue bird of 1927 and campbell-napier-railton blue bird of 1931 , segrave 's golden arrow of 1929 , and john cobb 's napier-railton and railton special , which held the record from 1939–64 she was then commanded to the royal yacht by king edward vii where he congratulated her on her pluck and skill , and they discussed the performance of the boat and its potential for british government despatch work early in the war , napier was contracted to build engines from other companies ' designs : initially the model raf 3 , a v-12 by royal aircraft factory , and then the v-8 sunbeam arab rowledge ( who left for rolls-royce in 1921 ) , its engine was a 40–50 & nbsp ; hp alloy six with detachable cylinder head , single overhead camshaft , seven-bearing crankshaft , dual magneto and coil ignition , dual plugs , and napier-su carburettor the lion went on to be adapted for land and water , to set the land speed record in malcolm campbell 's napier-campbell blue bird of 1927 and campbell-napier-railton blue bird 0f 1931 and henry segrave 's golden arrow of 1931 and later in john cobb 's napier-railton and railton mobil special , which held the record from 1939–64 napier quickly started work on newer designs , building on experience gained on the x style 16-cylinder , 1,000 & nbsp ; hp ( 746 & nbsp ; kw ) cub , used in the blackburn cubaroo single-engined bomber of the 1920s , and the resulting later 16-cylinder rapier and 24-cylinder dagger were both air-cooled h-block designs at that point efforts were made to improve it , leading eventually to the sabre vii delivering 3,500 & nbsp ; hp ( 2,600 & nbsp ; kw ) , making it the most powerful engine in the world , from an engine much smaller than its competition during the war ( 1944 ) napier was asked by the royal navy to supply a diesel engine for use in its patrol boats , but the culverin 's 720 & nbsp ; hp ( 537 & nbsp ; kw ) was not nearly enough for its needs considered one of the most complex engine designs of its day , the deltic was nevertheless very reliable , and was taken into service after the war as a locomotive powerplant ( in british rail 's class 55 ) in addition to the torpedo boats , minesweepers and other small naval vessels for which it was designed also during the second world war a six-cylinder 300 cubic inch road-vehicle engine was commissioned by the government , but this design was sold to leyland motors by 1945 last of the great napier internal combustion engines was the nomad , a complicated '' turbo-compound '' design that combined a diesel engine with a turbine to recover energy otherwise lost in the exhaust it was to continue to market the gazelle , while the completion of existing gazelle contracts and the eland remained the financial responsibility of the old company
