however , ccfls are strictly limited in the degree to which they can be dimmed , both because a lower plasma current will lower the temperature of the cathode , causing erratic operation , and because running the cathode at too low a temperature drastically shortens the life of the lamps each time a pulse is applied to a control electrode , a glow discharge moves to a step electrode ; by providing ten electrodes in each tube and cascading the tubes , a counter system can be developed and the count observed by the position of the glow discharges although creating the initial space charge and the first arc of current through the tube may require a very high voltage , once the tube begins to heat up , the electrical resistance drops , thus increasing the electric current through the lamp image : zm1210-operating edit2.jpg thumb upright the stacked digit arrangement in a nixie tube is visible here a cold-cathode vacuum tube does not rely on external heating of an electrode to provide thermionic emission of electrons a cold cathode is distinguished from a hot cathode that is heated to induce thermionic emission of electrons the electrode may take advantage of this heating to facilitate the thermionic emission of electrons when it is acting as a cathode a common cold-cathode application is in neon signs and other locations where the ambient temperature is likely to drop well below freezing , the clock tower , palace of westminster ( big ben ) uses cold-cathode lighting behind the clock faces where continual striking and failure to strike in cold weather would be undesirable the flash tube is a cold-cathode device filled with xenon gas , used to produce an intense short pulse of light for photography or to act as a stroboscope to examine the motion of moving parts in the case of tubes with an ionizing gas , the gas can become a very hot plasma , and electrical resistance is greatly reduced neon lamps primarily rely on excitation of gas molecules to emit light ; ccfls use a discharge in mercury vapor to develop ultraviolet light , which in turn causes a fluorescent coating on the inside of the lamp to emit visible light addition of a trigger electrode to a device allowed the glow discharge to be initiated by an external control circuit ; bell laboratories developed a '' trigger tube '' cold-cathode device in 1936 in some tubes , glow discharge around the cathode is usually minimized ; instead there is a so-called positive column , filling the tube the discharge is self-sustaining when for each electron that leaves the cathode , enough positive ions hit the cathode to free , on average , another electron
