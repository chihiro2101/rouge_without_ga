prior to the adoption of the rules by the united states house of representatives , the house operates under general parliamentary rules and jefferson 's manual but these are not binding on the current house until they are approved by the membership of the current congress after the clerk of the house receives the bill it is then assigned a legislative number , enrolled in the house journal and printed in the congressional record and the speaker of the house refers the bill to the committee ( s ) with jurisdiction by sending the bill to the office of the chairman of the committee ( s ) , and the clerk of the committee will add the bill to the committee 's calendar any member of the house can introduce a bill at any time , while the house is in session , by placing ( or most likely having a page place ) a signed copy of the bill in the '' hopper '' at the side of the clerk 's desk on the rostrum there are three types of house committees , these are : 1 ) standing committees elected by members of the house , 2 ) select committees appointed by the speaker of the house , and 3 ) joint committees whose members are chosen according to the statute or resolution that created that committee at the beginning of the legislative business day , after the prayer , approval of the previous day 's journal , and pledge of allegiance , the speaker of the house may recognize members for one-minute speeches after the conclusion of time for debate and after all amendments have been disposed of , the matter is usually voted upon by the full house , unless the rules permit and a member moves to recommit ( or commit ) the bill back to committee the speaker calls the house to order , the chaplain of the house then offers a prayer , and the speaker and house approves the legislative journal from the previous legislative day the house may under certain rules remove the bill or measure from committee ( see discharge petition ) if the committee fails to report the measure to the house rules committee or to the full house and a negative report to the full house does not terminate the bill the number of members who serve on a committee along with the party ratio of a committee

outlined in the house rules , specifically rule xiv during the 114th congress , but variations exist to this order as a result of house rules or parliamentary rules that take precedence upon being reported out of committee or removed from committee by the house , a bill will be added to the house calendar and any rules setting out how much time is allowed for debate , or other matters may be passed by the house in the form of a resolution under the house rules the chairman and members of standing committees are selected through a two-step procedure where the democratic caucus and the republican conference recommends members to serve on committees , the majority party recommends a chairman , and the minority party recommends a ranking member and finally the full house can approve the recommendation of the party caucuses if amendments are permitted under the rules governing floor action on the bill they are debated and voted upon at the time of the amendment ( although common practice usually permits the house to debate several amendments without immediately voting on them , then voting back-to-back at the end of the series of amendments , which can either be voice votes or recorded votes ) clause 7 of rule xvii forbids members from '' bringing to the attention of the house an occupant in the galleries of the house '' in practice , this prevents members from talking about the visitors which are seated in the galleries above haas , clerk of the house of representatives , january 6 , 2015 rules of the house of representatives , one hundred fifteenth congress ,
