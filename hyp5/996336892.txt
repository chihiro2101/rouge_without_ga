this federally legislated displacement initiative , dubbed the indian removal , forced a significant number of the five tribes to indian territory in other parts of the north american continent over several decades , many to what later became oklahoma territory the chickasaw are indian people of the united states who originally resided along the tennessee river and other parts of tennessee , west of present-day huntsville , alabama , parts of mississippi and the southwest side of kentucky some historians credit the chickasaws ' intervention in the french and indian war on the side of the british as decisive in ensuring that the united states became an english-speaking nation the chickasaws were one of the '' five civilized tribes '' who went to the indian territory during the era of indian removal '' the five civilized tribes : cherokee , chickasaw , choctaw , creek , seminole '' ( civilization of the american indian ) the choctaw are an indian people originally from the southeastern united states ( mississippi , alabama and , to a lesser extent , louisiana ) the word choctaw ( also rendered as chahta , chato , tchakta , and chocktaw ) is possibly a corruption of the spanish chato , meaning flattened , in allusion to the tribe 's custom of flattening the heads of infants they have grown substantially since the trail of tears and there are currently about 231,000 members , making the choctaw the third largest native american population in the united states starting in 1836 , the american government forced them to travel west of the mississippi along with the other civilized tribes to '' indian territory '' federally recognized creek tribes included the muscogee creek nation , poarch band of creek indians in alabama , alabama-quassarte tribal town , kialegee tribal town , thlopthlocco tribal town , and the miccosukee tribe of indians of florida the seminole nation came into existence in the 18th century and was composed of renegade and outcast native americans from georgia , mississippi , and alabama , most significantly the creek people , as well as african americans who escaped from slavery in south carolina and georgia while roughly 3,000 seminoles were forced west of the mississippi river , including the seminole nation of oklahoma , who picked up new members along the way , approximately 300 to 500 seminoles stayed and fought in and around the everglades of florida for about twenty years after the move to indian territory ( oklahoma ) , the seminoles refused to live with the muscogee creek tribe or under their government until they finally reached an agreement with the government to sign a treaty and live with them the term '' civilized '' has historically been used to distinguish the five tribes from other native american groups that were formerly often referred to as '' wild '' or '' savage '' the word '' civilized '' was used by whites to refer to the five tribes , who , during the 18th and early 19th centuries , actively integrated anglo-american customs into their own cultures while the term '' five civilized tribes '' has been institutionalized in federal government policy to the point that the us congress passed laws using the name , the five nations themselves have been less accepting of it in formal matters , and some members have declared that grouping the different peoples under this label is effectively another form of colonization and control by white society other modern scholars have suggested that the very concept of '' civilization '' was internalized by individuals who belonged to the five nations , but because much of native north american history has been communicated by oral tradition , little scholarly research has been done to substantiate this , have asserted that it is demeaning and implies that the indigenous peoples of the north american continent were '' uncivilized '' before their contact with the habits , customs , and beliefs of anglo-american settlers
