at the same time , lawrence 's recent invention , the cyclotron , promised to revolutionise experimental nuclear physics , and chadwick felt that the cavendish laboratory would fall behind unless it also acquired one when lawrence postulated the existence of a new and hitherto unknown particle that he claimed was a possible source of limitless energy at the solvay conference in 1933 , chadwick responded that the results were more likely attributable to contamination of the equipment while lawrence rechecked his results at berkeley only to find that chadwick was correct , rutherford and oliphant conducted an investigation at the cavendish that found that deuterium fuses to form helium-3 , thereby causing the effect that the lawrence had observed the total cost of £5,184 was more than chadwick had received from the university and the royal society , so chadwick paid the rest from his ( £8,243 ) nobel prize money they calculated that this would result in the release of about 200 mev , implying an energy release orders of magnitude greater than chemical reactions , and frisch confirmed their theory experimentally chadwick did not believe that there was any likelihood of another war with germany in 1939 , and took his family for a holiday on a remote lake in northern sweden determined not to spend another war in an internment camp , chadwick made his way to stockholm as fast as he could , but when he arrived there with his family , he found that all air traffic between stockholm and london had been suspended in october 1939 , chadwick received a letter from sir edward appleton , the secretary of the department of scientific and industrial research , asking for his opinion on the feasibility of an atomic bomb instead of looking at unenriched uranium oxide , they considered what would happen to a sphere of pure uranium-235 , and found that not only could a chain reaction occur , but that it might require as little as of uranium-235 , and unleash the energy of tons of dynamite a special subcommittee of the committee for the scientific survey of air warfare ( cssaw ) , known as the maud committee , was created to investigate the matter further pegram and harold urey visited britain to see how the project , now known as tube alloys , was going , chadwick was able to tell them : '' i wish i could tell you that the bomb is not going to work , but i am 90 per cent sure that it will sir hermann bondi suggested that it was fortunate that chadwick , not rutherford , was the doyen of uk physics at the time , as the latter 's prestige might otherwise have overpowered chadwick 's interest in '' looking forward '' to the bomb 's prospects the enormous scope of the effort became more apparent in 1942 : even a pilot separation plant would cost over £1 million and strain britain 's resources , to say nothing of a full-scale plant , which was estimated to cost somewhere in the vicinity of £25 million at the same time that the british became convinced that a joint project was necessary , the progress of the american manhattan project was such that british cooperation seemed less essential , although the americans were still eager to utilise chadwick 's talents chadwick , oliphant , peierls and simon were summoned to the united states by the director of tube alloys , sir wallace akers , to work with the manhattan project leaving rotblat in charge in liverpool , chadwick began a tour of the manhattan project facilities in november 1943 , except for the hanford site where plutonium was produced , which he was not allowed to see chadwick accepted that the americans did not need british help , but that it could still be useful in bringing the project to an early and successful conclusion requests from groves via chadwick for particular scientists tended to be met with an immediate rejection by the company , ministry or university currently employing them , only to be overcome by the overriding priority accorded to tube alloys he was present at the meeting of the combined policy committee on 4 july when field marshal sir henry maitland wilson gave britain 's agreement to use the atomic bomb against japan , and at the trinity nuclear test on 16 july , when the first atomic bomb was detonated laurence , the new york times reporter attached to the manhattan project , wrote that '' never before in history had any man lived to see his own discovery materialize itself with such telling effect on the destiny of man at this time , sir james mountford , the vice chancellor of the university of liverpool , wrote in his diary '' he had never seen a man 'so physically , mentally and spiritually tired '' as chadwick , for he '' had plumbed such depths of moral decision as more fortunate men are never called upon even to peer into & nbsp ; he was made a companion of honour in the new year honours on 1 january 1970 for '' services to science '' , companion of honour and went to buckingham palace for the investiture ceremony the chadwick laboratory at the university of liverpool is named after him , as is its sir james chadwick chair of experimental physics , which was named after him in 1991 as part of celebrations of the centenary of his birth
