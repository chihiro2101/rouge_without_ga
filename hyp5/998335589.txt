the goal was to integrate components from previous and new government intelligence and surveillance programs , including genoa , genoa ii , genisys , ssna , eeld , wae , tides , communicator , humanid and bio-surveillance , with data mining knowledge gleaned from the private sector to create a resource for the intelligence , counterintelligence , and law enforcement communities tia 's goal was to revolutionize the united states ' ability to detect , classify and identify foreign terrorists and decipher their plans , thereby enabling the u.s to that end , tia was to create a counter-terrorism information system that : increases information coverage by an order of magnitude and affords easy scaling provides focused warnings within an hour after a triggering event occurs or an evidence threshold is passed automatically queues analysts based on partial pattern matches and has patterns that cover 90 % of all previously known foreign terrorist attacks supports collaboration , analytical reasoning and information sharing so that analysts can hypothesize , test and propose theories and mitigating strategies , so decision-makers can effectively evaluate the impact of policies and courses of action another goal was to develop '' a large , distributed system architecture for managing the huge volume of raw data input , analysis results , and feedback , that will result in a simpler , more flexible data store that performs well and allows us to retain important data indefinitely evidence extraction and link discovery ( eeld ) developed technologies and tools for automated discovery , extraction and linking of sparse evidence contained in large amounts of classified and unclassified data sources ( such as phone call records from the nsa call database , internet histories , or bank records ) wargaming the asymmetric environment ( wae ) focused on developing automated technology that could identify predictive indicators of terrorist activity or impending attacks by examining individual and group behavior in broad environmental context and the motivation of specific terrorists the human identification at a distance ( humanid ) project developed automated biometric identification technologies to detect , recognize and identify humans at great distances for '' force protection '' , crime prevention , and '' homeland security/defense '' purposes the university of southampton 's department of electronics and computer science was developing an '' automatic gait recognition '' system and was in charge of compiling a database to test it the data included a set of nine static pictures taken from different viewpoints , a video of each subject looking around a room , a video of the subject speaking , and one or more videos of the subject showing facial expressions there were also plans for tia to have an application that could '' anonymize '' data , so that information could be linked to an individual only by court order ( especially for medical records gathered by the bio-surveillance project ) the term '' total information awareness '' was first coined at the 1999 annual darpatech conference in a presentation by the deputy director of the office of information systems management , brian sharkey a former national security adviser to president ronald reagan and a key player in the iran–contra affair , he was working with syntek technologies , a company often contracted out by the government for work on defense projects in january 2002 poindexter was appointed director of the newly created information awareness office division of darpa , which managed tia 's development the office temporarily operated out of the fourth floor of darpa 's headquarters , while poindexter looked for a place to permanently house tia 's researchers late that year , the information awareness office awarded the science applications international corporation ( saic ) a 19 million contract to develop the '' information awareness prototype system '' , the core architecture to integrate all of tia 's information extraction , analysis , and dissemination tools on 24 january 2003 , the united states senate voted to limit tia by restricting its ability to gather information from emails and the commercial databases of health , financial and travel companies 108-7 , division m , § 111 ( b ) passed in february , the defense department was given 90 days to compile a report laying out a schedule of tia 's development and the intended use of allotted funds or face a cutoff of support also in may , total information awareness was renamed terrorism information awareness in an attempt to stem the flow of criticism on its information-gathering practices on average citizens on september 30 , 2003 , congress officially cut off tia 's funding and the information awareness office ( with the senate voting unanimously against it ) because of its unpopular perception by the general public and the media reports began to emerge in february 2006 that tia 's components had been transferred to the authority of the national security agency the total information awareness project lives on , mit technology review , 26 april 2006 , retrieved 16 june 2016 most of the original project goals and research findings were preserved , but the privacy protection mechanics were abandoned genoa ii , which focused on collaboration between machines and humans , was renamed '' topsail '' and handed over to the nsa 's advanced research and development activity , or arda ( arda was later moved to the director of national intelligence 's control as the disruptive technologies office ) the information awareness prototype system was reclassified as '' basketball '' and work on it continued by saic , supervised by arda in an op-ed for the new york times , william safire called it '' the supersnoop 's dream : a total information awareness about every u.s '' hans mark , a former director of defense research and engineering at the university of texas , called it a '' dishonest misuse of darpa '' in the 2008 british television series the last enemy , tia is portrayed as a uk-based surveillance database that can be used to track and monitor anybody by putting all available government information in one place .
