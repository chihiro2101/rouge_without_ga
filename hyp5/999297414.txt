they cut a square trench on the ground , leaving the turf in the middle ; on that they make a fire of wood , on which they dress a large caudle of eggs , butter , oatmeal and milk ; and bring besides the ingredients of the caudle , plenty of beer and whisky ; for each of the company must contribute something five years later , the english housekeeper by anne cobbett ( daughter of william cobbett ) gives variants of caudles , of either gruel ( oatmeal ) or rice , with different types of alcohol , and seasonings , including capillaire emily post 's 1922 etiquette in society , in business , in politics , and at home , the classic guide to american manners , states that '' although according to cook-books caudle is a gruel , the actual '' caudle '' invariably served at christenings is a hot eggnog , drunk out of little punch cups '' ( see punch bowl ) a generation later in 1821 , thomas gaspey wrote of these visits ( with the italics in the original ) : offering caudel , or cake and caudel , to all lying-in visitors is referred to as an old british custom another recipe from the late 14th century has more ingredients and more details on the cooking procedure : mix breadcrumbs , wine , sugar or honey , and saffron , bring to a boil , then thicken with egg yolks , and sprinkle with salt , sugar , and ginger apparently it was '' a custom in france to bring the bridegroom a caudle in the middle of the night on his wedding-night '' , according to an explanatory note in an 1877 edition of essays ( montaigne ) , presumably inserted by the english editor , william carew hazlitt . after the christening of the youngest , princess amelia in 1783 , '' the greater part of the company then paid a visit to the nursery , where they were entertained ( as usual on such occasions ) with cake and caudel the rites begin with spilling some of the caudle on the ground , by way of libation : on that everyone takes a cake of oatmeal , upon which are raised nine square knobs , each dedicated to some particular being , the supposed preserver of their flocks and herds , or to some particular animal , the real destroyer of them : each person then turns his face to the fire , breaks off a knob , and flinging it over his shoulders , says , 'this i give to thee , preserve thou my horses ; this to thee , preserve thou my sheep ; and so on the earliest surviving recipe for caudle , from 1300â€“1325 , is simply a list of ingredients : wine , wheat starch , raisins , and sugar to '' abate the strength of the wine ''
