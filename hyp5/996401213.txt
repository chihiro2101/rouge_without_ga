gopal krishna gokhale was born on 9 may 1866 in kotluk village of guhagar taluka in ratnagiri district , in present-day maharashtra ( then part of the bombay presidency ) gokhale 's education tremendously influenced the course of his future career – in addition to learning english , he was exposed to western political thought and became a great admirer of theorists such as john stuart mill and edmund burke gokhale became a member of the indian national congress in 1889 , as a protégé of social reformer mahadev govind ranade he was moderate in his views and attitudes , and sought to petition the british authorities by cultivating a process of dialogue and discussion which would yield greater british respect for indian rights gokhale had visited ireland and had arranged for an irish nationalist , alfred webb , to serve as president of the indian national congress in 1894 gokhale was viewed as a well-meaning man of moderate disposition , while tilak was a radical who would not resist using force for the attainment of freedom the two leaders also vied for the control of the poona sarvajanik sabha and the founding of the deccan sabha by gokhale in 1896 was the consequence of tilak coming out ahead a comprehensive biography of gopal krishna gokhale by govind talwalkar portrays gokhale 's work in the context of his time , giving the historical background in the 19th century gokhale was a scholar , social reformer , and a statesman , arguably the greatest indian liberal in 1905 , when gokhale was elected president of the indian national congress and was at the height of his political power , he founded the servants of india society to specifically further one of the causes dearest to his heart : the expansion of indian education for gokhale , true political change in india would only be possible when a new generation of indians became educated as to their civil and patriotic duty to their country and to each other believing existing educational institutions and the indian civil service did not do enough to provide indians with opportunities to gain this political education , gokhale hoped the servants of india society would fill this need in his preamble to the sis 's constitution , gokhale wrote that '' the servants of india society will train men prepared to devote their lives to the cause of country in a religious spirit , and will seek to promote , by all constitutional means , the national interests of the indian people gokhale , though now widely viewed as a leader of the indian nationalist movement , was not primarily concerned with independence but rather with social reforms ; he believed such reforms would be best achieved by working within existing british government institutions , a position which earned him the enmity of more aggressive nationalists such as tilak the empirical knowledge coupled with the experience of the representative institutions made gokhale an outstanding political leader , moderate in ideology and advocacy , a model for the people 's representatives gokhale 's achievement must be studied in the context of predominant ideologies and social , economic and political situation at that time , particularly in reference to the famines , revenue policies , wars , partition of bengal , muslim league and the split in the congress at surat as a young barrister , gandhi returned from his struggles against the empire in south africa and received personal guidance from gokhale , including a knowledge and understanding of india and the issues confronting common indians gandhi also recognised gokhale as an admirable leader and master politician , describing him as '' pure as crystal , gentle as a lamb , brave as a lion and chivalrous to a fault and the most perfect man in the political field '' despite his deep respect for gokhale , however , gandhi would reject gokhale 's faith in western institutions as a means of achieving political reform and ultimately chose not to become a member of gokhale 's servants of india society the ancestral house was constructed by gopal krishna gokhale for his family in pune , and it continues to be the residence of the gokhale-dhavle descendants to this day
