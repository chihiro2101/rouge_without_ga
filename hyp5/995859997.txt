while this phase is not abnormal and is a part of its mechanism of action , it is undesirable during surgery , due to the inability to depolarize the cell again succinylcholine chloride injection indicated , in addition to general anesthesia , to facilitate tracheal intubation and to provide skeletal muscle relaxation during surgery or mechanical ventilation it is indicated , in addition to general anesthesia , to facilitate tracheal intubation and to provide skeletal muscle relaxation during surgery or mechanical ventilation papers published by stephen thesleff and otto von dardel in sweden are important but also to be mentioned is work by bruck , mayrhofer and hassfurther in austria , scurr and bourne in uk , and foldes in america in people with neuromuscular disease or burns , an injection of suxamethonium can lead to a large release of potassium from skeletal muscles , potentially resulting in cardiac arrest side effects include malignant hyperthermia , muscle pains , acute rhabdomyolysis with hyperkalemia , transient ocular hypertension , constipation and changes in cardiac rhythm , including bradycardia , and cardiac arrest the latter means that , should attempts at endotracheal intubation fail and the person can not be ventilator , there is a prospect for neuromuscular recovery and the onset of spontaneous breathing before hypoxemia occurs when plasma levels of butyrylcholinesterase are greatly diminished or an atypical form is present ( an otherwise harmless inherited disorder ) , paralysis may last much longer , as is the case in liver failure or in neonates suxamethonium is also commonly used as the sole muscle relaxant during electroconvulsive therapy , favoured for its short duration of action the side effect of high blood potassium may occur because the acetylcholine receptor is propped open , allowing continued flow of potassium ions into the extracellular fluid when mh develops during a procedure , treatment with dantrolene sodium is usually initiated ; dantrolene and the avoidance of suxamethonium administration in susceptible people have markedly reduced the mortality from this condition binding of suxamethonium to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor results in opening of the receptor 's monovalent cation channel ; a disorganized depolarization of the motor end-plate occurs and calcium is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum conditions having susceptibility to suxamethonium-induced high blood potassium are burns , closed head injury , acidosis , guillain–barré syndrome , cerebral stroke , drowning , severe intra-abdominal sepsis , massive trauma , myopathy , and tetanus genetically , ninety six percent of the population have a normal ( eu : eu ) genotype and block duration ; however , some people have atypical genes ( ea , es , ef ) which can be found in varying combinations with the eu gene , or other atypical genes ( see pseudocholinesterase deficiency )
