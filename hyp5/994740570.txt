during the late eocene , the australian/new guinean continent began a period of drying that caused a retreat in the area of rainforest , which forced the ancestral pademelons to begin living in a dryer , rockier environment after some generations of adaptation to the new environment , the pademelons may have evolved into rock-wallaby ( petrogale spp the rainforest contractions isolated populations of bohra which resulted in the evolution of today 's tree-kangaroos ( dendrolagus spp ) , as they adapted to lifestyles in geographically small and diverse rainforest fragments , and became further specialized for a canopy-dwelling lifestyle inustus ) ; northern and western new guinea , plus the island of yapen , and possibly salawati and waigeo lumholtz 's tree-kangaroo ( d pulcherrimus ) ; the foja mountains , papua and the torricelli mountains , papua new guinea lowlands tree-kangaroo ( d tree-kangaroos inhabit the tropical rainforests of new guinea , far northeastern australia , and some of the islands in the region , in particular , the schouten islands and the raja ampat islands most tree-kangaroos are considered threatened due to hunting and habitat destruction tree-kangaroos must find places comfortable and well-adapted for breeding , as they only give birth to one joey per year they are known to have one of the most relaxed and leisurely birthing seasons their habitats are breeding grounds for danger , as they can easily fall prey to their natural predator , the amethystine python , which also climbs and lives in the treetops like terrestrial kangaroos , tree-kangaroos do not sweat to cool their bodies , rather , they lick their forearms and allow the moisture to evaporate in an adaptive form of behavioural thermoregulation however , in trees , they are bold and agile they climb by wrapping their forelimbs around the trunk of a tree and , while allowing the forelimbs to slide , hop up the tree using their powerful hind legs some captive tree-kangaroos ( perhaps limited to new guinea species ) eat protein foods such as eggs , birds and snakes , making them omnivores the two most significant threats to tree-kangaroos are habitat loss and hunting research conducted on lumholtz 's tree-kangaroo , a species that dwells in the rain forests of northeastern australia , determined the frequency of causes of death
