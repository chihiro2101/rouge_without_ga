tree-kangaroos inhabit the tropical rainforests of new guinea , far northeastern australia , and some of the islands in the region , in particular , the schouten islands and the raja ampat islands most tree-kangaroos are considered threatened due to hunting and habitat destruction the two most significant threats to tree-kangaroos are habitat loss and hunting their habitats are breeding grounds for danger , as they can easily fall prey to their natural predator , the amethystine python , which also climbs and lives in the treetops ) , as they adapted to lifestyles in geographically small and diverse rainforest fragments , and became further specialized for a canopy-dwelling lifestyle research conducted on lumholtz 's tree-kangaroo , a species that dwells in the rain forests of northeastern australia , determined the frequency of causes of death during the late eocene , the australian/new guinean continent began a period of drying that caused a retreat in the area of rainforest , which forced the ancestral pademelons to begin living in a dryer , rockier environment they climb by wrapping their forelimbs around the trunk of a tree and , while allowing the forelimbs to slide , hop up the tree using their powerful hind legs like terrestrial kangaroos , tree-kangaroos do not sweat to cool their bodies , rather , they lick their forearms and allow the moisture to evaporate in an adaptive form of behavioural thermoregulation they are known to have one of the most relaxed and leisurely birthing seasons inustus ) ; northern and western new guinea , plus the island of yapen , and possibly salawati and waigeo lumholtz 's tree-kangaroo ( d some captive tree-kangaroos ( perhaps limited to new guinea species ) eat protein foods such as eggs , birds and snakes , making them omnivores the rainforest contractions isolated populations of bohra which resulted in the evolution of today 's tree-kangaroos ( dendrolagus spp after some generations of adaptation to the new environment , the pademelons may have evolved into rock-wallaby ( petrogale spp pulcherrimus ) ; the foja mountains , papua and the torricelli mountains , papua new guinea lowlands tree-kangaroo ( d tree-kangaroos must find places comfortable and well-adapted for breeding , as they only give birth to one joey per year however , in trees , they are bold and agile
