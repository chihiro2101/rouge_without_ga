schwann cells are a variety of glial cells that keep peripheral nerve fibres ( both myelinated and unmyelinated ) alive the vertebrate nervous system relies on the myelin sheath for insulation and as a method of decreasing membrane capacitance in the axon myelinating schwann cells begin to form the myelin sheath in mammals during fetal development and work by spiraling around the axon , sometimes with as many as 100 revolutions the inner layers of the wrapping , which are predominantly membrane material , form the myelin sheath , while the outermost layer of nucleated cytoplasm forms the neurilemma successful axons can , therefore , reconnect with the muscles or organs they previously controlled with the help of schwann cells , but specificity is not maintained and errors are frequent , especially when long distances are involved it is found in the dorsal root ganglion and motor neurons at the point in time that schwann cell precursors begin to populate spinal nerves and therefore influences schwann cell survival myelin protein zero ( p0 ) is a cell-adhesion molecule belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily and is the major component of peripheral myelin , constituting over 50 % of the total protein in the sheath unexpectedly , p0- mice also showed degeneration of both axons and their surround myelin sheaths , suggesting that p0 plays a role in maintaining the structural integrity of both myelin formation and the axon with which it ’ s associated several important transcription factors are also expressed and involved at various stages in development changing the features on the schwann cells from an immature to mature state krox-20 is considered as one of the master regulators of pns myelination and is important in driving transcription of specific structural proteins in the myelin indeed , in these mice , the schwann cells are not able to perform their myelination properly as they only wrap their cytoplasmic processes one and half turn around the axon and despite the fact that they still express the early myelin marker , late myelin gene products are absent in addition , recent studies have also proven the importance of this transcription factor in maintaining the myelination phenotype ( and requires the co-expression of sox 10 ) as its inactivation leads to dedifferentiation of the schwann cells charcot–marie–tooth disease ( cmt ) , guillain–barré syndrome ( gbs , acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculopathy type ) , schwannomatosis , and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy ( cidp ) , leprosy , and zika virus are all neuropathies involving schwann cells in the past two decades , many studies have demonstrated positive results and potential for schwann cell transplantation as a therapy for spinal cord injury , both in aiding regrowth and myelination of damaged cns axons
