the canal du midi also allows other sports , mainly in urban areas , such as rowing , canoeing , fishing , cycling , roller-skating , and hiking along the banks this is one of the fundamental roles of the canal and one of the reasons for its maintenance by the state since the end of commercial traffic corinne labat , robert fuggetta , guy jungblut , marvin holdt , and gilles bernard , the canal du

to be architectural and technical heritage as evidenced by the refusal of the mayor of toulouse , pierre baudis , to allow space on the canal du midi to be used for an urban expressway michel cotte ,

specializes in the management and maintenance of french canals in a market and commercial economy and not in the tourism market where the canal du midi is located however , a report of the general inspectorate of architecture and heritage in 2003 showed that the channel was in very poor condition with many works and infrastructure devaluing its surroundings and suffering from significant housing pressure evidenced by uncontrolled construction , poorly designed facilities that misrepresent the site , and the construction of marinas in the ports on the canal nevertheless , to respect the uniformity of the canal development and support efforts for improvement , the canal du midi remains under the management of vnf under the tutelage of the state who want to create a monitoring mission like the loire and mont-saint-michel the numbers given in locks on the canal du midi count the number of individual lock chambers hence the discrepancy 126 bridges , 55 aqueducts , 7 aqueducts

tens of kilometres away and bring it to the seuil de naurouze , the highest point of the future canal , through channels these channels , called '' rigole de la montagne '' ( channel of the mountain ) and '' rigole de la plaine '' ( channel of the plain ) connected the upper three reservoirs ( lampy , cammazes , and saint-ferréol ) at the seuil de naurouze initially , two reservoirs fed the highest point of the canal at the seuil de naurouze : the bassin de saint-ferréol had a capacity of 6.3 & nbsp ; million cubic metres and was built between 1667 and 1672 michel cotte , canal du midi , marvel

provides access to the hérault going to the mediterranean michel cotte , canal du midi , marvel of europe , paris : belin , 2003 , 191 pages , , p toulouse has two ports : the port de l'embouchure is located at the junction of the canal du midi , the canal de brienne , and the canal de garonne while port saint-sauveur is located in the centre of town near the hall of grains carcassonne is today a major tourist stop on the canal and has a port built in 1810 at the time when the city was connected to the canal there are also the ports of homps which was one of the most important on the canal and le somail which was a popular place for rest and recreation finally , just before its arrival at the mediterranean sea , the canal has two ports : the port of agde where there is the old hotel of the '' administration of the canal '' , and the port of onglous at marseillan which is the last port before sète and its royal canal giving access to the sea related article : aqueducts on the canal du midi several aqueducts an aqueduct is a 'canal bridge ' ( pont-canal in french ) carrying a canal over a river or valley , or any depression in the terrain the same word in english is used for any overhead structure carrying water , while the french equivalent aqueduc refers to a water conveyance structure or ( as in the case of the canal du mid ) a siphon or culvert under the canal some aqueducts date from the time of pierre-paul riquet , but most were built after the completion of the canal in particular due to improvements recommended by vauban the canal has the following aqueducts ( in order from agde to toulouse ) : orb aqueduct ( pk 208 ) which was inaugurated in 1857 , eliminating the difficult crossing of the river orb cesse aqueduct ( pk 168 ) répudre aqueduct ( pk 159 ) was built between 1667 and 1676 to span the répudre near the village of paraza it was also the first aqueduct built by pierre-paul riquet orbiel aqueduct at trebes ( pk 117 ) fresquel aqueduct ( pk 109 ) was built beginning in 1800 and opened on 31 may 1810 , as a result of the realignment of the route to pass through the centre of the city of carcassonne , a city that refused to pay a share of the cost when the canal was first built herbettes aqueduct , ( pk 8 ) , a new aqueduct at toulouse completed in 1983 , 74m long , to cross a four-lane motorway pierre-paul riquet and the engineers who followed him over three centuries built many other structures on the canal du midi , of which the most important are listed here : the malpas tunnel 165m long southeast of the oppidum d'ensérune béziers , topographic map at 1/25000 scale , ign series , '' top 25 '' no which passes through a hill 50m above sea level and was a technical challenge for the time the argent-double spillway located in la redorte near the argent-double aqueduct : this work incorporates eleven successive stone arches contemporary to vauban , its designer ; it was built by antoine de niquet and allows for the overflow water from the canal to be discharged into the stream the fonserannes water slope , which bypasses the 6-lock staircase at fonserannes , was built at the time when the canal was to be upgraded to freycinet gauge to save time and allow larger vessels to work on it has a unique machinery whose maintenance is expensive , but for several years , vnf has attempted to rehabilitate it to reduce waiting times at the fonséranes locks the ouvrages du libron ( the works of libron ) , a unique achievement of its kind which allows the canal to cross the course of the libron near agde the watermills of the canal du midi are located in derivation of the number of locks ( e.g corinne labat , robert fuggetta , guy jungblut , marvin holdt , and gilles bernard , the canal du midi , from the
