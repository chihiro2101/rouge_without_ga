this aliasing is visible in images such as posters with lenticular printing : if they have low angular resolution , then as one moves past them , say from left-to-right , the 2d image does not initially change ( so it appears to move left ) , then as one moves to the next angular image , the image suddenly changes ( so it jumps right ) â€“ and the frequency and amplitude of this side-to-side movement corresponds to the angular resolution of the image ( and , for frequency , the speed of the viewer 's lateral movement ) , which is the angular aliasing of the 4d light field when the receiver shifts multiple signals down to lower frequencies , from rf to if by heterodyne , an unwanted signal , from an rf frequency equally far from the local oscillator ( lo ) frequency as the desired signal , but on the wrong side of the lo , can end up at the same if frequency as the wanted one if a piece of music is sampled at 32,000 sampling rate ( hz ) , any frequency components at or above 16,000 hz ( the nyquist frequency for this sampling rate ) will cause aliasing when the music is reproduced by a digital-to-analog converter ( dac ) the lack of parallax on viewer movement in 2d images and in 3-d film produced by stereoscopy glasses ( in 3d films the effect is called '' yawing '' , as the image appears to rotate on its axis ) can similarly be seen as loss of angular resolution , all angular frequencies being aliased to 0 ( constant ) temporal aliasing frequencies in video and cinematography are determined by the frame rate of the camera , but the relative intensity of the aliased frequencies is determined by the shutter timing ( exposure time ) or the use of a temporal aliasing reduction filter during filming when sampling a function at frequency & nbsp ; is met for the highest frequency component of the original signal , then it is met for all the frequency components , a condition called the nyquist criterion a form of spatial aliasing can also occur in antenna arrays or microphone arrays used to estimate the direction of arrival of a wave signal , as in geophysical exploration by seismic waves if sampled at a high enough rate , determined by the bandwidth , the original function can , in theory , be perfectly reconstructed from the infinite set of samples the high frequencies in the analog signal will appear as lower frequencies ( wrong alias ) in the recorded digital sample and , hence , can not be reproduced by the dac the aliasing distortion in the lower frequencies is increasingly obvious with higher fundamental frequencies , and while the bandlimited sawtooth is still clear at 1,760 & nbsp ; hz , the aliased sawtooth is degraded and harsh with a buzzing audible at frequencies lower than the fundamental
