the two are both rare-earth fluorocarbonates , but parisite 's formula of ca ( ce , la , nd ) 2 ( co 3 ) 3 f 2 contains calcium ( and a small amount of neodymium ) and a different ratio of constituent ions bastnäsite forms a series with the minerals hydroxylbastnäsite- ( ce ) ( ce , la ) co 3 ( oh , f ) and hydroxylbastnäsite- ( nd ) hisinger , who was also the owner of the bastnäs mine , chose to name one of the new minerals bastnäsit when it was first described by him in 1838 also found in carbonatites , a rare carbonate igneous intrusive rock , at the fen complex , norway ; bayan obo , mongolia ; kangankunde , malawi ; kizilcaoren , turkey and the mountain pass rare earth mine in california , us there is also bastnäsite- ( la ) with a formula of ( la , ce ) co 3 f and finally there is bastnäsite- ( y ) with a formula of ( y , ce ) co 3 f there is bastnäsite- ( ce ) with a more accurate formula of ( ce , la ) co 3 f ore from the bastnäs mine led to the discovery of several new minerals and chemical elements by swedish scientists such as jöns jakob berzelius , wilhelm hisinger and carl gustav mosander solvents are added ( solvent type and concentration based on area , availability , and cost ) to help separate eu , sm , and gd from la , nd , and pr bastnäsite and the phosphate mineral monazite are the two largest sources of cerium , an important industrial metal there is little difference in the three in terms of physical properties and most bastnäsite is bastnäsite- ( ce ) among these are the chemical elements cerium , which was described by hisinger in 1803 , and lanthanum in 1839 some bastnäsite has been found in the unusual granites of the langesundsfjord area , norway ; kola peninsula , russia ; mont saint-hilaire mines , ontario , and thor lake deposits , northwest territories , canada
