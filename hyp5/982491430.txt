the boy continued his studies in paris at the lycée louis-le-grand , and in 1757 began his military career as a volunteer in the campaign of rossbach , where he served as a cornet in the régiment d'escars he received a commission for good conduct in action , and served in the later german campaigns of the seven years ' war with distinction ( he received 22 wounds ) ; but at the peace he was retired as a captain , with a small pension and the cross of st louis dumouriez then visited italy and corsica , spain and portugal , and his memoranda to the duc de choiseul on corsican affairs at the time of the corsican republic led to his re-employment on the staff of the french conquest of corsica , for which he gained the rank of lieutenant-colonel after this , he became a member of the secret du roi , the secret service under louis xv , which gave full scope to his diplomacy skills in 1772 , upon returning to paris , dumouriez sought a military position from the marquis de monteynard , secretary of state for war , who gave him a staff position with the regiment of lorraine writing diplomatic and military reports in the meantime , dumouriez had turned his attention to the internal state of his own country , and amongst the very numerous memoranda which he sent to the government was one on the defence of normandy and its ports , which procured for him in 1778 the post of commandant of cherbourg , which he administered with much success for ten years however , opportunity arose again when , in his capacity as a lieutenant-general and the commandant of nantes , he offered to march to the assistance of the national constituent assembly after the royal family 's unsuccessful flight to varennes minister of war , louis lebègue duportail , promoted dumouriez from president of the war council to major-general in june 1791 and attached him to the twelfth division , which was commanded by general jacques alexis de verteuil he then attached himself to the girondist party and , on 15 march 1792 , became the french minister of foreign affairs on the king 's dismissal of roland , clavière and servan ( 13 june 1792 ) , he took servan 's post of minister of war , but resigned it two days later on account of louis xvi 's refusal to come to terms with the national constituent assembly , and went to join the army of marshal luckner to the more radical elements in paris , it became clear that dumouriez was not a true patriot when he returned to paris on 1 january 1793 and worked during the trial of louis xvi to save him from execution arresting the four deputy-commissioners of the national convention who had been sent to inquire into his conduct ( camus , bancal-des-issarts , quinette , and lamarque ) as well as the minister of war , pierre riel de beurnonville , he handed them over to the enemy , and then attempted to persuade his troops to march on paris and overthrow the revolutionary government the attempt failed , and dumouriez , along with the duc de chartres ( afterwards king louis philippe ) and his younger brother , the duc de montpensier , fled into the austrian camp he became a valuable adviser to the british war office in its struggle against napoleon , though the extent of his aid only became public many years later
