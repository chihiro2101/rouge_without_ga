collins dictionary of the english language , london , 1986 , p.520 the sense is of a feudal estate in land falling-out of the possession by a tenant into the possession of the lord in feudal england , escheat referred to the situation where the tenant of a fee ( or '' fief '' ) died without an heir or committed a felony in the case of such demise of a tenant-in-chief , the fee reverted to the king 's demesne permanently , when it became once again a mere tenantless plot of land , but could be re-created as a fee by enfeoffment to another of the king 's followers where the deceased had been subinfeudated by a tenant-in-chief , the fee reverted temporarily to the crown for year and a day rule by right of seisin after which it escheated to the over-lord who had granted it to the deceased by enfeoffment such tenures , even the highest one of '' feudal barony '' , never conferred ownership of land but merely ownership of rights over it , that is to say ownership of an estate in land where no legal heir existed , the logic of the situation was that the fief had ceased to exist as a legal entity , since being tenantless no one was living who had been enfeoffed with the land , and the land was thus technically owned by either the crown or the immediate overlord ( where the fee had been subinfeudated by the tenant-in-chief to a mesne lord , and perhaps the process of subinfeudation had been continued by a lower series of mesne-lords ) as ultimus heres escheat could also take place if a tenant was outlawed or convicted of a felony , when the king could exercise the ancient right of wasting the criminal 's land for a year and a day , after which the land would revert to the overlord he is dead ) issued by the king 's chancery , to empanel a jury to hold an '' escheat roll '' to ascertain who the legal heir was , if any , and what was the extent of the land held in england and wales , the possibility of escheat of a deceased person 's property to the feudal overlord was abolished by the administration of estates act 1925 ; however , the concept of bona vacantia means that the crown ( or duchy of cornwall or duchy of lancaster ) can still receive such property if no one else can be found who is eligible to inherit it the term is often now applied to the transfer of the title to a person 's property to the state when the person dies intestate without any other person capable of taking the property as heir for example , a common-law jurisdiction 's intestacy statute might provide that when someone dies without a will , and is not survived by a spouse , descendants , parents , grandparents , descendants of parents , children or grandchildren of grandparents , or great-grandchildren of grandparents , then the person 's estate will escheat to the state it is relatively common for a trustee in bankruptcy to disclaim freehold property which may give rise to a liability , for example the common parts of a block of flats owned by the bankrupt would ordinarily pass to the trustee to be realised in order to pay his debts , but the property may give the landlord an obligation to spend money for the benefit of lessees of the flats the bankruptcy of the original owner means that the freehold is no longer the bankrupt 's legal property , and the disclaimer destroys the freehold estate , so that the land ceases to be owned by anyone and effectively escheats to become land held by the crown in demesne land held directly by the crown , known as property in the '' royal demesne '' , is not held under any vestige feudal tenure ( the crown has no historical overlord other than , for brief periods , the papacy ) and there is therefore no estate to register thus , if property has escheated to a state but the original owner subsequently is found , escheatment is revoked and ownership of the property reverts to that original owner
