soon after the fastbus ( ieee 960 ) follow-on futurebus ( ieee 896 ) project in 1987 , some engineers predicted it would already be too slow for the high performance computing marketplace by the time it would be released in the early 1990s sci is a standard for connecting the different resources within a multiprocessor computer system , and it is not as widely known to the public as for example the ethernet family for connecting different systems sci can be used to build systems with different types of switching topologies from centralized to fully distributed switching : with a central switch , each node is connected to the switch with a ringlet ( in this case a two-node ring ) the standard defined two interface levels : the physical level that deals with electrical signals , connectors , mechanical and thermal conditions the logical level that describes the address space , data transfer protocols , cache coherence mechanisms , synchronization primitives , control and status registers , and initialization and error recovery facilities the memory tag holds a pointer to the head of the linked list and a state code for the line ( three states – home , fresh , gone ) gustavson led a group called the scalable coherent interface and serial express users , developers , and manufacturers association and maintained a web site for the technology starting in 1996 in january 1998 , the sldram corporation was formed to hold patents on an attempt to define a new memory interface that was related to another working group called serialexpress or local area memory port ( the other popular models for cache coherency are based on system-wide eavesdropping ( snooping ) of memory transactions – a scheme which is not very scalable these different implementations interface to very intricate mechanisms in processors and memory systems and each vendor has to preserve some degrees of compatibility for both hardware and software each node holds a directory for the main memory of the node with a tag for each line of memory ( same line length as the cache line ) after the first 1992 edition , follow-on projects defined shared data formats in 1993 , a version using low-voltage differential signaling in 1996 , and a memory interface known as ramlink later in 1996 in the other case , the packet is fed to a receive queue and may be transferred to a ring in another dimension different versions and derivatives of sci were implemented by companies like dolphin interconnect solutions , convex , data general aviion ( using cache controller and link controller chips from dolphin ) , sequent and cray research sci defines a 64-bit flat address space ( 16 exabytes ) where 16 bits are used for identifying a node ( 65,536 nodes ) and 48 bits for address within the node ( 256 terabytes )
