' ) episode 4 , the crook report : one morning , at ftv , challenge roger has been such a success and roger is asked to present the crook report ( a parody of the cook report ) after roger cook gets beaten up , but before rushing into it , tom tells him to be calm , sympathetic and tactful at all times on one occasion in 2006 , while requiring a liver transplant ( due to chronic alcoholism ) , roger became a hit-and-run driver : he ran over and killed a motorcyclist without stopping , later receiving the dead man 's liver for himself , then celebrating the successful liver transplant with a booze-up at the nearest pub as the builder starts the job , roger and tom head down to the pub for a few drinks and after telling the barman that he will mention his pub on the telly , he gives them the drinks free of charge eventually , on the green , brucie and tarbuck have putted and after roger is finished , he goes off to the clubhouse for a drink , but tom tells him that it was only the first hole and there is still another 17 to go vizs founder and main contributor chris donald has said that the character of roger mellie was inspired by the off-screen behaviour of rod griffith , a 1980s tyne tees television presenter but that mellie is nothing like griffith and other presenters have been worked into the character , including look north presenter mike neville roger gets annoyed with the contestant beside him ( a parody of whose line panelist john sessions ) , and after being asked by clive anderson to do a poem about changing a light bulb , he does it in the style of muhammad ali roger 's double act is tom , in early strips , a director or producer , later a portmanteau figure , an agent for roger or a television executive , to suit the script while brucie takes his shot , roger is trying to find his 'bastard ball !
