archaeological findings show people settled in the middle alpine region , later to be called tyrol , when the glaciers retreated and flora and fauna revived , after the last ice age ended around 12,000 bc in the bronze and iron ages the region was home to a series of autochthonous cultures occupying roughly the area of the later county of tyrol the laugen-melaun culture , named after two important archaeological sites near the modern-day town of brixen in south tyrol , originated in the 14th century bc , in the area of today 's south tyrol and trentino it soon spread over the central area of the southern alps , encompassing south and east tyrol , trentino north of rovereto and the lower engadine ; the northern part of tyrol came under the influence of the urnfield culture around 500 bc , the fritzens-sanzeno culture , also known as culture of the raeti , after the goddess raetia who according to roman authors was the main deity of the people inhabiting the region , succeeded both the laugen-melaun culture of the southern and the urnfield culture of the northern part of tyrol nonetheless , the fritzens-sanzeno-people possessed important distinct cultural traits distinguishing them from adjacent groups , such as the typical mountain-sanctuaries already in use during the time of the laugen-melaun culture , certain types of fibulae , bronze armor , and their own alphabet derived from one of north etruscan alphabets ( but not from the etruscan alphabet ) in 15 bc , the region was conquered by the romans , and its northern and eastern part incorporated into the roman empire as the provinces of raetia and noricum respectively as in the rest of europe , the roman era left deep impressions on the culture and language , with the rhaeto-romance languages after the conquest of italy by the goths , tyrol became part of the ostrogothic kingdom from the 5th to the 6th century after the fall of the ostrogothic kingdom in 553 , the germanic tribe of the lombards invaded italy and founded the lombard kingdom of italy , which no longer included all of tyrol , only its southern part consequently , tyrol came to be of great importance as a bridgehead to italy , which was re-affirmed during the italian campaign of otto i in the years 1007 and 1027 the emperors of the holy roman empire granted the counties of trento , bolzano and vinschgau to the bishopric of trent in 1027 the county of norital was granted to the bishopric of brixen , followed in 1091 by the county of puster valley since the bishops were nominated directly by the emperor and their office was not hereditary , putting the area under their control was intended to secure it to the emperors over the centuries , the counts residing in tirol castle , near merano , extended their territory over the region at the end of count meinhard ii 's rule ( 1259–1295 ) the '' county and reign of tyrol '' had established itself firmly in the '' land on the adige and inn '' , as the region was then called in 1330 she was married to john-henry ( who later became the margrave of moravia ) , who she repudiated with the help of the tyrolean aristocracy in order to marry duke ludwig v of bavaria , a member of the powerful wittelsbach dynasty margarete maultasch decided to bequeath tyrol to duke rudolph iv of the house of habsburg , probably pressed by the aristocracy , an act which caused a conflict between meinhard 's uncle stephen ii , who forged an alliance with the powerful lord of milan bernabò visconti to invade tyrol , and the house of habsburg the battle of sempach in 1386 , in which duke leopold iii of austria was defeated by the old swiss confederacy had important repercussions on tyrol , and was the first of a series of military conflicts between the county and its neighbours ( innsbruck : alpina printers and publishers ) p.2 during frederick iv 's tenure internal conflicts between the powerful local aristocracy and the duke arose , which eventually led to the decline of the nobles and of their traditional system of values , and strengthened the duke 's rule over the country maximilian added kufstein , rattenberg and kitzbühel to tyrol , and when he inherited the puster valley and east tyrol the borders of tyrol were set , with the exception of the 1817 addition of the ziller valley chizzali when in 1808 a new constitution for the kingdom of bavaria was introduced , tyrol was integrated into south bavaria , and divided into three districts , losing its special status in the kingdom one day later a military unit of 8000 men consisting of bavarian and french troops approached innsbruck from the brenner pass , but was convinced to surrender by captain teimer , who dressed up as a major of the regular austrian army and made the bavarian officers believe that the austrian army was approaching innsbruck , when in fact it was still about 40 miles away thumb on the eve of world war i , the southern part of the austrian crown land of tyrol was populated mainly by italian speakers ( the so-called welschtirol , or trentino ) the existence of areas largely populated by italian-speaking populations under the rule of the austrian empire was a constant cause of friction between austria and italy , a national state set on the unification of all italians italy 's fear that it would not get what it wanted in the event of a victorious triple alliance caused it to remain neutral during the first year of the war , and the preoccupation that it would n't get what it wanted from a victorious entente either if it remained neutral led it to join the war on the side of the latter italy conducted intense negotiations with austria , which was prepared to part with trentino in exchange of italy 's neutrality , but italy wanted ( among other things ) to reach the alpine water divide , which it claimed as its 'natural border ' , a demand which austria refused , since it would have meant giving up a territory regarded as personal fief by the habsburg emperors on 26 april 1915 , italy signed the treaty of london , agreeing to declare war against the central powers in exchange for the unredeemed territories of trentino , gorizia , trieste and dalmatia , as well as the part of german tyrol south of the main alpine divide the ideals of irredentism were used to convince the population of the necessity of the war , but the true motive of the political leadership to join the war was their idea that italy should become a great european power the first to occupy higher ground became almost impossible to dislodge , so both sides turned to drilling tunnels under mountain peaks , filling them up with explosives , then detonating the entire mountain , including its defenders , such as col di lana , monte pasubio , lagazuoi , etc under the terms of the austrian-italian armistice of villa giusti , as well as being required to evacuate all territory occupied since august , austria-hungary 's forces were required to withdraw from south tyrol , tarvisio , the soča , gorizia , trieste , istria , western carniola , and dalmatia to secure access to the inn valley , crucial for an advance into southern germany , innsbruck , capital of tyrol , and the village landeck were occupied as well the treaty of saint-germain-en-laye ( 1919 ) ruled that , according to the treaty of london , the southern part of tyrol had to be ceded to the kingdom of italy also , pedemonte ( includes former municipality of casotto ) was transferred from province of trento to province of vicenza in 1929 , and towns of magasa and valvestino were transferred from province of trento to province of brescia in 1934 .
