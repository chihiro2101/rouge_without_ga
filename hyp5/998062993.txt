in 1952 , uc berkeley and subsequent uc san diego sio physicist hugh bradner , who is considered to be the original inventor and '' father of the modern wetsuit , '' had the insight that a thin layer of trapped water could be tolerated between the suit fabric and the skin , so long as insulation was present in the fabric in the form of trapped bubbles however , the suit loses thermal protection as the bubbles in the neoprene are compressed at depth non-foamed solid neoprene has a thermal conductivity between 0.15 & nbsp ; wm −1 k −1 and 0.45 & nbsp ; wm −1 k −1 depending on type , not very different from water – buoyancy is also reduced by compression , and scuba divers can correct this by inflating the buoyancy compensator though more expensive and more difficult to take on and off than a wetsuit ( in most cases , a helper will be needed to close the dry-zip , which is usually located across the shoulders ) , semi-dry suits are cheap and simple compared to dry suits , and in the case of scuba diving , require no additional skills to use nitrogen , like most gases , has very low thermal conductivity compared to water or to solids , nitrogen has a thermal conductivity of 0.024 & nbsp ; wm −1 k −1 , the same as air – and the small and enclosed nature of the gas bubbles minimizes heat transport through the gas by convection in the same way that cloth fabrics or feathers insulate by reducing convection of enclosed air spaces in the popular mind , the layer of water between skin and suit has been credited with providing the insulation , but bradner clearly understood that the suit did not need to be wet because it was not the water that provided the insulation but rather the gas in the suit fabric the result is that the gas filled cavities restrict heat transfer to mostly conduction , which is partly through bubbles of entrapped gas , thereby greatly reducing heat transfer from the body ( or from the layer of warmed water trapped between the body and the wetsuit ) to the colder water surrounding the wetsuit they are usually made from thick neoprene ( typically 6mm or more ) , which provides good thermal protection at shallow depth , but lose buoyancy and thermal protection as the gas bubbles in the neoprene compress at depth , like a normal wetsuit measurements of volume change of neoprene foam used for wetsuits under hydrostatic compression shows that about 30 % of the volume , and therefore 30 % of surface buoyancy , is lost in about the first 10 & nbsp ; m , another 30 % by about 60 & nbsp ; m , and the volume appears to stabilise at about 65 % loss by about 100 & nbsp ; m as early as july 1951 , spearfishing in australia were experimenting with a natural rubber wetsuit '' of a 'wrap on ' variety , which does not set out to be 100 % waterproof ( but it is claimed that ) the leakage of water through it is so slow that body warmth under it is maintained for hours a specialized kind of wetsuit , with a very smooth ( and somewhat delicate ) outer surface known as smoothskin , which is the original outer surface of the foamed neoprene block from which the sheets are cut , is used for long-distance swimming , triathlon competitive apnoea and bluewater spearfishing wetsuits are made of closed-cell foam neoprene , a synthetic rubber that contains small bubbles of nitrogen gas when made for use as wetsuit material ( neoprene may also be manufactured without foaming for many other applications where insulating qualities are not important ) for example , a thin strip of single-backed wrapped around the leg , neck , and wrist openings of the suit creates a seal that greatly reduces the flushing of water in and out of the suit as the person 's body moves flushing in the neck area can be reduced by using a hood attached to the top part of the suit , or by having sufficient overlap between the hood and the top part of the suit to constrain flow between the two parts one-piece suit worn by kitesurfer file : rnli lifeguard jersey.jpg alt rnli crewman seated in small inflatable , wearing helmet and bright red wetsuit. high visibility suit for sea rescue file : mikebaird - two surfing teens.jpg alt two surfers wearing one-piece wetsuits , riding a wave. surfers in steamer wetsuits in open water swimming events the use of wetsuits is controversial , as some participants claim that wetsuits are being worn for competitive advantage and not just for warmth the mass will depend on the specific formulation of the foam , but will probably be in the order of 4 & nbsp ; kg , for a net buoyancy of about 6 & nbsp ; kg at the surface this allowed a swimmer to pull on the suit relatively easily since the nylon took most of the stress of pulling on the suit , but the suit still had the bare foam exposed on the outside and the nylon was relatively stiff , limiting flexibility because wetsuits offer significant protection from jellyfish , coral , sunburn and other hazards , many divers opt to wear a thin suit which provides minimal insulation ( often called a '' bodysuit '' ) even when the water is warm enough to comfortably forego insulating garments the united states navy also turned down bradner 's and bascom 's offer to supply its swimmers and frogmen with the new wetsuits due to concerns that the gas in the neoprene component of the suits might make it easier for naval divers to be detected by underwater sonar after experimenting with the material and finding it superior to other insulating foams , o'neill founded the successful wetsuit manufacturing company called o'neill in a san francisco garage in 1952 , later relocating to santa cruz , california in 1959 with the motto '' it 's always summer on the inside '' wetsuits are used for thermal insulation for activities where the user is likely to be immersed in water , or frequently doused with heavy spray , often approaching from near-horizontal directions , where normal wet-weather clothing is unlikely to keep the water out a wetsuit must have a snug fit to work efficiently when immersed ; too loose a fit , particularly at the openings ( wrists , ankles , neck and overlaps ) will allow cold water from the outside to enter when the wearer moves for instance , a wetsuit with a torso thickness of 5 & nbsp ; mm and a limb thickness of 3 & nbsp ; mm will be described as a '' 5/3 '' insulation is proportional to thickness and thus to how cold the water which the user can tolerate ; it may be above or below the standard of 5–6 & nbsp ; mm of neoprene the wearer gets wet in a semi-dry suit but the water that enters is soon warmed up and is not '' flushed '' out by colder water entering from the outside environment , so the wearer remains warm this can be achieved by tucking a circular flap at the base of the neck of the hood under the top of the suit before closing the zip , or by having a high neck on the suit depending on the overall buoyancy of the diver , this will generally require 6 & nbsp ; kg of additional weight to bring the diver to neutral buoyancy to allow reasonably easy descent the volume lost at 10 & nbsp ; m is about 3litres , or 3 & nbsp ; kg of buoyancy , rising to about 6 & nbsp ; kg buoyancy lost at about 60 & nbsp ; m a blindstitch sewing machine uses a curved needle , which does not go all the way through the neoprene but just shallowly dips in behind the fabric backing , crosses the glue line , and emerges from the surface on the same side of the neoprene in many water sports such as scuba diving , surfing , kayaking , windsurfing , sailing and even fishing , bootees may be worn to keep the feet warm in the same way that a wetsuit would a long john , johnny , johnny suit , or farmer john/jane ( depending on the gender the suit is designed for ) covers the torso and legs only ; it resembles a bib overall , hence the nickname when colorful double-backed designer suits started appearing , taping moved primarily to the inside of the suit because the tape was usually very wide , jagged , black , and ugly , and was hidden within the suit and out of sight typically , two-piece cold water wetsuits have 10 to 14 & nbsp ; mm of material around the torso and 5 to 7 & nbsp ; mm for the limbs to achieve flexibility and low bulk for a given warmth of suit , they are unlined inside , and the slightly porous raw surface of the neoprene adheres closely to the skin and reduces flushing of the suit wetsuits heated by a flow of hot water piped from the surface are standard equipment for commercial diving in cold water , particularly where the heat loss from the diver is increased by use of helium based breathing gases ) , most open water swim races either do not permit the use of wetsuits , ( usually defined as anything covering the body above the waist or below the knees ) , or put wetsuit-clad swimmers in a separate category and/or make them ineligible for race awards water has a thermal conductivity of 0.58 & nbsp ; wm −1 k −1 while still air has a thermal conductivity of 0.024 & nbsp ; wm −1 k −1 , so an unprotected person can succumb to hypothermia even in warmish water on a warm day usually a wetsuit has no covering for the feet , hands or head , and the diver must wear separate neoprene boots , gloves and hood for additional insulation and environmental protection a hooded tunic , covering the torso and head , with short legs and either short or no sleeves , is generally intended to be worn over a full suit , and has a zip closure an average person has a surface area of about 2 & nbsp ; m 2 , so the uncompressed volume of a full one piece 6 & nbsp ; mm thick wetsuit will be in the order of 1.75 x 0.006 0.0105 & nbsp ; m 3 , or roughly 10 litres for cold water use , thicker mittens with a single space for the middle , ring and fifth fingers are available and can provide more warmth at the cost of reducing dexterity where boots are worn with a wetsuit they are usually tucked under the leg of the suit for streamlining , to help hold the zip closed , and to keep foreign objects out some suits are arranged in two parts ; the jacket and long johns can be worn separately in mild conditions or worn together to provide two layers of insulation around the torso in cold conditions this fabric can be bonded to one or both surfaces in various combinations of weight and colour , and can be thin and relatively smooth and fragile , or thicker and stronger and less stretchy uncompressed foam neoprene has a typical thermal conductivity in the region of 0.054 & nbsp ; wm −1 k −1 , which produces about twice the heat loss of still air , or one-tenth the loss of water each of these arrangements has some advantages and some disadvantages : the front zipper is easy to operate , but the suit may be difficult to remove from the shoulders without assistance , and the zip is uncomfortable for lying on a surfboard the elasticity of the foamed neoprene and surface textiles allow enough stretch for many people to effectively wear off-the-shelf sizes , but others have to have their suits custom fitted to get a good fit that is not too tight for comfort and safety in a rubber wetsuit this does not work well for a number of reasons , the main one being that punching holes straight through both layers of foam for the thread opens up passages for water to flow in and out of the suit wetsuits used for caving are often single-backed with a textured surface known as '' sharkskin '' which is a thin layer where the neoprene is less expanded precision computer-controlled cutting and assembly methods , such as water jet cutter , have allowed ever greater levels of seam precision , permitting designers to use many small individual strips of different colors while still keeping the suit free of bulging and ripples from improper cutting and sewing for surfing , windsurfing , kitesurfing and similar sports , bootees are typically worn where the weather is so cold that the surfer would lose some degree of functionality in the feet other accessories to the basic suit include pockets for holding small items and equipment , and knee-pads , to protect the knee area from abrasion and tearing , usually used by working divers
