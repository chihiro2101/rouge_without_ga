'' front side '' refers to the external interface from the processor to the rest of the computer system , as opposed to the back side , where the back-side bus connects the cache ( and potentially other cpus ) the fsb design was a performance improvement over the single system bus designs of the previous decades , but these front-side buses are sometimes referred to as the '' system bus '' front-side buses usually connect the cpu and the rest of the hardware via a chipset , which intel implemented as a northbridge and a southbridge other buses like the peripheral component interconnect ( pci ) , accelerated graphics port ( agp ) , and memory buses all connect to the chipset in order for data to flow between the connected devices the frequency at which a processor ( cpu ) operates is determined by applying a clock multiplier to the front-side bus ( fsb ) speed in some cases the memory bus connects the northbridge and ram , just as the front-side bus connects the cpu and northbridge in image , audio , video , gaming , fpga synthesis and scientific applications that perform a small amount of work on each element of a large data set , fsb speed becomes a major performance issue overclocking is the practice of making computer components operate beyond their stock performance levels by manipulating the frequencies at which the component is set to run , and , when necessary , modifying the voltage sent to the component to allow it to operate at these higher frequencies more stably in a traditional architecture , the front-side bus served as the immediate data link between the cpu and all other devices in the system , including main memory in hypertransport- and qpi-based systems , system memory is accessed independently by means of a memory controller integrated into the cpu , leaving the bandwidth on the hypertransport or qpi link for other uses the bandwidth or maximum theoretical throughput of the front-side bus is determined by the product of the width of its data path , its clock rate ( cycles per second ) and the number of data transfers it performs per clock cycle for example , a 64-bit ( 8-byte ) wide fsb operating at a frequency of 100 & nbsp ; mhz that performs 4 transfers per cycle has a bandwidth of 3200 megabytes per second ( mb/s ) : :8 bytes/transfer & times ; 100 mhz & times ; 4 transfers/cycle 3200 mb/s the number of transfers per clock cycle depends on the technology used
