in one english translation , hilbert asks : '' when we are engaged in investigating the foundations of a science , we must set up a system of axioms which contains an exact and complete description of the relations subsisting between the elementary ideas of that science but above all i wish to designate the following as the most important among the numerous questions which can be asked with regard to the axioms : to prove that they are not contradictory , that is , that a definite number of logical steps based upon them can never lead to contradictory results in geometry , the proof of the compatibility of the axioms can be effected by constructing a suitable field of numbers , such that analogous relations between the numbers of this field correspond to the geometrical axioms on the other hand a direct method is needed for the proof of the compatibility of the arithmetical axioms hilbert 's statement is sometimes misunderstood , because by the '' arithmetical axioms '' he did not mean a system equivalent to peano arithmetic , but a stronger system with a second-order completeness axiom as a nowadays common interpretation , a positive solution to hilbert 's second question would in particular provide a proof that peano arithmetic is consistent these do not provide a resolution to hilbert 's second question , however , because someone who doubts the consistency of peano arithmetic is unlikely to accept the axioms of set theory ( which is much stronger ) to prove its consistency gödel 's second incompleteness theorem shows that it is not possible for any proof that peano arithmetic is consistent to be carried out within peano arithmetic itself however , as nagel and newman ( 1958:96 & ndash ; 99 ) explain , there is still room for a proof that can not be formalized in arithmetic : : '' this imposing result of godel 's analysis should not be misunderstood : it does not exclude a meta-mathematical proof of the consistency of arithmetic meta-mathematical proofs of the consistency of arithmetic have , in fact , been constructed , notably by gerhard gentzen , a member of the hilbert school , in 1936 , and by others since then gentzen 's proof proceeds by assigning to each proof in peano arithmetic an ordinal number , based on the structure of the proof , with each of these ordinals less than epsilon zero the method used in this proof can also be used to prove a cut elimination result for peano arithmetic in a stronger logic than first-order logic , but the consistency proof itself can be carried out in ordinary first-order logic using the axioms of primitive recursive arithmetic and a transfinite induction principle while the theorems of gödel and gentzen are now well understood by the mathematical logic community , no consensus has formed on whether ( or in what way ) these theorems answer hilbert 's second problem 2 ) calls the belief that gödel 's theorem eliminates the possibility of a persuasive consistency proof '' erroneous '' , citing the consistency proof given by gentzen and a later one given by gödel in 1958 original text of hilbert 's talk , in german english translation of hilbert 's 1900 address : a definition of a '' finitary formal system '' is given by goldstein ( p
