symbolism is to be found in every one of zola 's novels , and rougon , in his main lines , is but the symbol of a principle , or , to be accurate , the symbol of a certain form of the principle of authority eugène is obsessed with power and controlling the lives of others , as zola makes clear in chapter 6 : '' with him it was love of power for sheer power 's sake , a love , what is more , untrammelled by any craving for personal glory or wealth or honours in l'argent ( which opens in 1864 ) , eugène 's refusal to help his brother aristide after a financial setback by the latter is the catalyst for the novel , spurring aristide to ruthless and unethical speculations that eventually lead to the financial ruination of thousands in le docteur pascal ( set in 1872 ) , zola tells us that eugène becomes a deputy in the legislative assembly and remains a staunch defender of the emperor and the empire after the franco-prussian war in his opinion : '' with all due allowance for its somewhat limited range of subject , son excellence eugene rougon is the one existing french novel which gives the reader a fair general idea of what occurred in political spheres at an important period of the empire in la conquête de plassans ( set in 1864-1865 ) , eugène is the unnamed '' friend '' who sends abbé faujas to plassans to solidify support for the emperor there ( in this , he shows an affinity to his brothers aristide , who lusts for money , and pascal , who thirsts for knowledge zola 's plan for the rougon-macquart novels was to show how heredity and environment worked on members of one family over the course of the second empire as rougon 's power has grown , so has hers , until she has influence at the highest level and on an international scale , including as the emperor 's mistress he is the incarnation of that craving , that lust for power which impelled so many men of ability to throw all principle to the winds and become the instruments of an abominable system of government ) zola also strongly suggests that the corrupt environment of second empire politics and society is what allows eugène 's personality and desire for power to be nurtured and fulfilled in consequence , after the attempt is made ( the felice orsini of 1858 ) , the emperor makes him minister of the interior with power to maintain peace and national security at any cost his face is rouher 's , like his build and his favorite gesture ; but with rouher 's words , actions , opinions , and experiences are blended those of half a dozen other personages
