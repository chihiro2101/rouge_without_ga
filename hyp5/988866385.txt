the word hemiola comes from the greek adjective ἡμιόλιος , hemiolios , meaning '' containing one and a half , '' '' half as much again , '' '' in the ratio of one and a half to one ( 3:2 ) , as in musical sounds the words '' hemiola '' and '' sesquialtera '' both signify the ratio 3:2 , and in music were first used to describe relations of pitch dividing the string of a monochord in this ratio produces the interval of a perfect fifth beginning in the 15th century , both words were also used to describe rhythmic relationships , specifically the substitution ( usually through the use of coloration—red notes in place of black ones , or black in place of '' white '' , hollow noteheads ) of three imperfect notes ( divided into two parts ) for two perfect ones ( divided into three parts ) in tempus perfectum or in prolatio maior hemiola can be used to describe the ratio of the lengths of two strings as three-to-two ( 3:2 ) , that together sound a perfect fifth the justly tuned pitch ratio of a perfect fifth means that the upper note makes three vibrations in the same amount of time that the lower note makes two in the cent system of pitch measurement , the 3:2 ratio corresponds to approximately 702 cents , or 2 % of a semitone wider than seven semitones the just perfect fifth can be heard when a violin is tuned : if adjacent strings are adjusted to the exact ratio of 3:2 , the result is a smooth and consonant sound , and the violin sounds in tune in rhythm , hemiola refers to three beats of equal value in the time normally occupied by two beats the oxford dictionary of music illustrates hemiola with a superimposition of three notes in the time of two and vice versa the new harvard dictionary of music states that in some contexts , a sesquialtera is equivalent to a hemiola grove 's dictionary , on the other hand , has maintained from the first edition of 1880 down to the most recent edition of 2001 that the greek and latin terms are equivalent and interchangeable , both in the realms of pitch and rhythm , william smyth rockstro , '' hemiolia '' , a dictionary of music and musicians ( a.d laird hold that , though similar in effect , hemiola properly applies to a momentary occurrence of three duple values in place of two triple ones , whereas sesquialtera represents a proportional metric change between successive sections the latter time is restored only at the cadences ( bars 4 and 11–12 ) : later in the same piece , bach creates a conflict between the two metres against : hemiola is found in many renaissance pieces in triple rhythm one of his best-known chansons is '' revoici venir du printemps '' , where the alternation of compound-duple and simple-triple metres with a common counting unit for the beat subdivisions can be clearly heard : the hemiola was commonly used in baroque music , particularly in dances , such as the courante and minuet later in the nineteenth century , tchaikovsky frequently used hemiolas in his waltzes , as did richard strauss in the waltzes from der rosenkavalier , and the third movement of robert schumann 's piano concerto is noted for the ambiguity of its rhythm the first movement of the third is cast in meter that is also open , through internal recasting as ( a so-called hemiola ) peter manuel , in the context of an analysis of the flamenco soleá song form , refers to the following figure as a horizontal hemiola or '' sesquialtera '' ( which mistranslates as : '' six that alters '' ) the figure is also used in many sub-varieties of the flamenco genre ( bulerías , for example ) , and in various popular latin american musics
