meyer and allen gave this example that '' positive relationships between tenure and commitment maybe due to tenure-related differences in job status and quality '' in developing this concept , meyer and allen drew largely on mowday , porter , and steers 's ( 2006 ) concept of commitment , which in turn drew on earlier work by kanter ( 1968 ) but an individual does n't see the positive costs as enough to stay with an organization they must also take into account the availability of alternatives ( such as another organization ) , disrupt personal relationships , and other '' side bets '' that would be incurred from leaving their organization the individual commits to and remains with an organization because of feelings of obligation , the last component of organizational commitment for example , the organization may have invested resources in training an employee who then feels a 'moral ' obligation to put forth effort on the job and stay with the organization to 'repay the debt meyer and allen based their research in this area more on theoretical evidence rather than empirical , which may explain the lack of depth in this section of their study compared to the others since the model was made , there has been conceptual critique to what the model is trying to achieve to date , the three-component conceptual model has been regarded as the leading model for organizational commitment because it ties together three aspects of earlier commitment research ( becker , 2005 ; buchanan , 2005 ; kanter , 1968 ; mathieu & zajac , 1990 ; mowday , porter , & steers , 1982 ; salancik , 2004 ; weiner , 2004 ; weiner & vardi , 2005 ) however , a collection of studies have shown that the model is not consistent with empirical findings in a sense the model describes why people should stay with the organization whether it is because they want to , need to , or ought to the model appears to mix together an attitude toward a target , that being the organization , with an attitude toward a behavior , which is leaving or staying they believe the studies should return to the original understanding of organizational commitment as an attitude toward the organization and measure it accordingly because eagly and chaiken 's model is so general , it seems that the tcm can be described as a specific subdivision of their model when looking at a general sense of organizational commitment after their research , sollinger , olffen , and roe believe eagly and chaiken 's attitude-behavior model from 1993 would be a good alternative model to look at as a general organizational commitment predictor because of its approach at organizational commitment as a singular construct , which in turn would help predicting various behaviors beyond turnover more recently , scholars have proposed a five component model of commitment , though it has been developed in the context of product and service consumption people get habituated to a job—the routine , the processes , the cognitive schemas associated with a job can make people develop a latent commitment to the job—just as it may occur in a consumption setting studies have been devoted to figuring out the dimensions of job satisfaction , antecedents of job satisfaction , and the relationship between satisfaction and commitment kalleberg ( 1990 ) studied work attitudes of workers in the us and japan and found a correlation of 0.73 between job satisfaction and organizational commitment of workers in japan and a higher significant correlation of 0.81 among americans : dysfunctions in role performance have been associated with a large number of consequences , almost always negative , which affect the well being of workers and functioning of organizations the study found that there was a strong relationship between organizational commitment and the cohesion of the leadership team and the amount of leadership support the study found that when leadership was distributed by the 'leader ' out to the teachers as well workers reported higher job satisfaction and organizational commitment than when most of the leadership fell to one person by the end of the 1990s , leaders did not find the value in understanding whether or not their people were more or less committed to the organization.it was particularly frustrating that leaders could see that people committed to the organization were not as committed to strategic change initiatives , the majority of which failed to live up to expectations
