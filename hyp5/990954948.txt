megafauna – in the sense of the largest mammals and birds – are generally k-strategists , with high longevity , slow population growth rates , low mortality rates , and ( at least for the largest ) few or no natural predators capable of killing adults one observation that has been made about the evolution of larger body size is that rapid rates of increase that are often seen over relatively short time intervals are not sustainable over much longer time periods this is thought to reflect the emergence , during a trend of increasing maximum body size , of a series of anatomical , physiological , environmental , genetic and other constraints that must be overcome by evolutionary innovations before further size increases are possible a strikingly faster rate of change was found for large decreases in body mass , such as may be associated with the phenomenon of insular dwarfism subsequent to the cretaceous–paleogene extinction event that eliminated the non-avian dinosaurs about ma ( million years ) ago , terrestrial mammals underwent a nearly exponential increase in body size as they diversified to occupy the ecological niches left vacant this trend of increasing body mass appears to level off about 40 ma ago ( in the late eocene ) , suggesting that physiological or ecological constraints had been reached , after an increase in body mass of over three orders of magnitude the largest of these , indricotheres and proboscids , have been hindgut fermenters , which are believed to have an advantage over foregut fermenters in terms of being able to accelerate gastrointestinal transit in order to accommodate very large food intakes time ( in ma ) occurred in perissodactyls ( a slope of 2.1 ) , followed by rodents ( 1.2 ) and proboscids ( 1.1 ) , all of which are hindgut fermenters terrestrial mammalian carnivores from several eutherian groups ( the artiodactyl andrewsarchus - formerly considered a mesonychid , the oxyaenid sarkastodon , and the carnivorans amphicyon and arctodus ) all reached a maximum size of about 1000 & nbsp ; kg ( the carnivoran arctotherium and the hyaenodontid simbakubwa may have been somewhat larger ) the former correlation would be consistent with bergmann 's rule , and might be related to the thermoregulation advantage of large body mass in cool climates , better ability of larger organisms to cope with seasonality in food supply , or other factors ; the latter correlation could be explained in terms of range and resource limitations since tetrapods ( first reptiles , later mammals ) returned to the sea in the late permian , they have dominated the top end of the marine body size range , due to the more efficient intake of oxygen possible using lungs by 40 ma ago , cetaceans had attained a length of 20 m or more in basilosaurus , an elongated , serpentine whale that differed from modern whales in many respects and was not ancestral to them however , in the period from 31 ma ago ( in the oligocene ) to the present , cetaceans underwent a significantly more rapid sustained increase in body mass ( a rate of increase in body mass 0.259 of a factor of 3.2 per million years ) than achieved by any group of terrestrial mammals fewer biomechanics constraints on increases in body size may be associated with suspension in water as opposed to standing against the force of gravity , and with aquatic locomotion as opposed to terrestrial locomotion the largest carnivorans of all time are marine pinnipeds , the largest of which is the southern elephant seal , which can reach 6 meters in length and weigh up to because of the small initial size of all mammals following the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs , nonmammalian vertebrates had a roughly ten-million-year-long window of opportunity ( during the paleocene ) for evolution of gigantism without much competition gastornithids and at least one lineage of flightless paleognath birds originated in europe , both lineages dominating niches for large herbivores while mammals remained below 45 & nbsp ; kg ( in contrast with other landmasses like north america and asia , which saw the earlier evolution of larger mammals ) and were the largest european tetrapods in the paleocene in south america , the related phorusrhacids shared the dominant predatory niches with metatherian sparassodonts during most of the cenozoic but declined and ultimately went extinct after eutherian predators arrived from north america ( as part of the great american interchange ) during the pliocene however , none of the flightless birds of the cenozoic , including the predatory brontornis , possibly omnivorous dromornis or herbivorous vorombe , ever grew to masses much above 500 & nbsp ; kg , and thus never attained the size of the largest mammalian carnivores , let alone that of the largest mammalian herbivores nearly all of the world 's isolated islands could furnish similar examples of extinctions occurring shortly after the arrival of humans , though most of these islands , such as the hawaiian islands , never had terrestrial megafauna , so their extinct fauna were smaller an analysis of the timing of holarctic megafaunal extinctions and extirpations over the last 56,000 years has revealed a tendency for such events to cluster within interstadials , periods of abrupt warming , but only when humans were also present an analysis of sporormiella fungal spores ( which derive mainly from the dung of megaherbivores ) in swamp sediment cores spanning the last 130,000 years from lynch 's crater in queensland , australia , showed that the megafauna of that region virtually disappeared about 41,000 years ago , at a time when climate changes were minimal ; the change was accompanied by an increase in charcoal , and was followed by a transition from rainforest to fire-tolerant sclerophyll vegetation the high-resolution chronology of the changes supports the hypothesis that human hunting alone eliminated the megafauna , and that the subsequent change in flora was most likely a consequence of the elimination of browsers and an increase in fire similar conclusions regarding the culpability of human hunters in the disappearance of pleistocene megafauna were derived from high-resolution chronologies obtained via an analysis of a large collection of eggshell fragments of the flightless australian bird genyornis newtoni , from analysis of sporormiella fungal spores from a lake in eastern north america and from study of deposits of shasta ground sloth dung left in over half a dozen caves in the american southwest continuing human hunting and environmental disturbance has led to additional megafaunal extinctions in the recent past , and has created a serious danger of further extinctions in the near future ( see examples below ) a number of other mass extinctions occurred earlier in earth 's geologic history , in which some or all of the megafauna of the time also died out given that phosphorus availability is thought to limit productivity in much of the region , the decrease in its transport from the western part of the basin and from floodplains ( both of which derive their supply from the uplift of the andes ) to other areas is thought to have significantly impacted the region 's ecology , and the effects may not yet have reached their limits in the sea , cetaceans and pinnipeds that feed at depth are thought to translocate nitrogen from deep to shallow water , enhancing ocean productivity , and counteracting the activity of zooplankton , which tend to do the opposite in the mesozoic , it has been estimated that sauropods could have emitted 520 million tons of methane to the atmosphere annually , contributing to the warmer climate of the time ( up to 10 & nbsp ; °c warmer than at present ) the decrease in atmospheric methane that occurred at that time , as recorded in ice cores , was 2-4 times more rapid than any other decrease in the last half million years , suggesting that an unusual mechanism was at work the following are some notable examples of animals often considered as megafauna ( in the sense of the '' large animal '' definition ) this list is not intended to be exhaustive : clade synapsida class mammalia ( phylogenetically , a clade within therapsida ; see below ) infraclass metatheria order diprotodontia the red kangaroo ( macropus rufus ) is the largest living australian mammal and marsupial at a weight of up to among recently extinct proboscideans , mammoths ( mammuthus ) were close relatives of elephants , while mastodons ( mammut ) were much more distantly related the extinct malagasy sloth lemur archaeoindris reached a similar size , while the extinct gigantopithecus blacki of southeast asia is believed to have been larger yet , although probably less than twice as large , contrary to early estimates ( the absence of postcranial remains makes its size difficult to judge ) some populations of archaic homo were significantly larger on average than recent homo sapiens ; for example , homo heidelbergensis in southern africa may have commonly reached in height , while neanderthals were about 30 % more massive the largest living forms are the polar bear ( ursus maritimus ) , with a body weight of up to , and the nearly as large kodiak bear ( ursus arctos middendorffi ) , consistent with bergmann 's rule the southern elephant seal ( mirounga leonina ) of antarctic and subantarctic waters is the largest carnivoran of all time , with bull males reaching a maximum length of and maximum weight of the average weight is 1,192 & nbsp ;

see below ) order struthioniformes the ratites are an ancient and diverse group of flightless birds that are found on fragments of the former supercontinent gondwana the largest living bird , the ostrich ( struthio camelus ) was surpassed by the extinct vorombe of madagascar , the heaviest of the group at up to , and the extinct dinornis ( dinornis ) of new zealand , the tallest , growing to heights of ( due to its small size for a continent and its isolation , australia is sometimes viewed as the world 's largest island ; thus , these species could also be considered insular giants ) order cathartiformes the extinct condor-like teratorn argentavis of south america had an estimated wing span of and a mass of approximately , making it the best example of a megafaunal flying bird class reptilia ( traditional ; paraphyletic ) order saurischia saurischian dinosaurs of the jurassic and cretaceous include sauropods , the longest ( at up to and most massive terrestrial animals known ( argentinosaurus reached 80–100 & nbsp ; metric tonnes , or 90–110 & nbsp ; tons ) , as well as theropods , the largest terrestrial carnivores ( spinosaurus grew to 7–9 tonnes ; the more famous tyrannosaurus , to 6.8 tonnes ) order crocodilia alligators and crocodiles are large semiaquatic reptiles , the largest of which , the saltwater crocodile ( crocodylus porosus ) , can grow to a weight of order squamata while the largest extant lizard , the komodo dragon ( varanus komodoensis ) , another island giant , can reach in length , its extinct australian relative megalania may have reached more than twice that size the heaviest extant snake is considered to be the green anaconda ( eunectes murinus ) , while the python reticulatus ( python reticulatus ) , at up to 8.7 m or more , is considered the longest an extinct australian pliocene species of liasis , the bluff downs giant python , reached 10 m , while the paleocene titanoboa of south america reached lengths of 12–15 m and an estimated weight of about class amphibia ( in the wide , probably paraphyletic , sense ) order temnospondyli ( relationship to lissamphibia is unclear ) the permian temnospondyl prionosuchus , the largest amphibian known , reached 9 m in length and was an aquatic predator resembling a crocodilian order acipenseriformes the critically endangered beluga ( european sturgeon , huso huso ) at up to is the largest sturgeon ( which are also mostly cartilaginous ) and is considered the largest anadromous fish its extinct relative megalodon ( the disputed genus being either carcharodon or carcharocles ) was more than an order of magnitude larger , and is the largest predatory shark or fish of all time ( and one of the largest predators in vertebrate history ) ; it preyed on whales and other marine mammals these include the giant squid ( architeuthis ) and colossal squid ( mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni ) ; both ( although rarely seen ) are believed to attain lengths of or more they survived over 200 million years , but finally died out in the permian–triassic extinction event along with trilobites and most other forms of life present at the time , including most of the dominant terrestrial therapsids australian megafauna bergmann 's rule charismatic megafauna cope 's rule deep-sea gigantism fauna island dwarfism island gigantism largest organisms largest prehistoric organisms list of heaviest land mammals list of largest mammals list of megafauna discovered in modern times megafauna ( mythology ) megafaunal wolf megaflora megaherb new world pleistocene extinctions pleistocene megafauna quaternary extinction event
