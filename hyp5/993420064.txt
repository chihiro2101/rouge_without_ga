these studies demonstrate that the grammatical functions of broca 's area and the semantic functions of wernicke 's area are indeed deep , abstract properties of the language system independent of its modality of expression although expressive aphasia may be caused by brain damage to many regions , it is most commonly associated with the inferior frontal gyrus , a region that overlaps with motor cortex controlling the mouth and tongue , extending into the periventricular white matter another less commonly known aphasia is global aphasia , which generally manifests itself after a stroke affecting an extensive portion of the brain occurs , including infarction of both divisions of the middle cerebral artery and generally both broca 's area and wernicke 's area receptive aphasia is associated with the posterior third of the superior temporal gyrus in the distribution of the inferior division of the middle cerebral artery , known as '' wernicke 's area '' , an area adjacent to the cortex responsible for auditory processing nonetheless , because their comprehension of spoken language is mostly preserved , and because their speech is usually good enough to get their point across , the agrammatic nature of their speech suggests that the disorder chiefly involves the expressive mechanisms of language that turn thoughts into well-formed sentences not much is known about what other areas must be damaged in order to produce broca 's aphasia , but some maintain damage to the inferior pre-rolandic motor strip ( the motor cortex region responsible glossopharyngeal muscle control ) is also necessary in it , wernicke described many of the different classifications of aphasia and is the basis for the classical model of aphasia lesions exclusively to broca 's area ( the foot of the inferior frontal gyrus ) do not produce broca 's aphasia , but instead mild dysprosody and agraphia , sometimes accompanied by word-finding pauses and mild dysarthria the discovery of what is now known as broca 's area was followed years later by carl wernicke 's famous work , 'the symptom-complex of aphasia : a psychological study on an anatomical basis ' in 1874 first described by the france neurologist paul broca in the nineteenth century , expressive aphasia causes the speech of those afflicted to display a considerable vocabulary but to show grammatical deficits
