although athaulf remained an arianism , his relationship with roman culture was summed up , from a catholic roman perspective , by the words that the contemporary christian apologist orosius put into his mouth , athaulf 's declaration : : at first i wanted to erase the roman name and convert all roman territory into a gothic empire : i longed for romania to become gothia , and athaulf to be what caesar augustus had been de imperatoribus romanis : hugh elton , '' western roman emperors of the first quarter of the fifth century '' septimane wisigothique : '' d'où venaient les wisigoths ? '' ( in french ) edward gibbon , history of the decline and fall of the roman empire , chapter 31 under the latter 's reign , galla placidia was returned to ravenna where , in 417 , at the urging of honorius , she remarried , her new husband being the implacable enemy of the goths , constantius concludes that the words are indeed athaulf 's and distinguishes them from their interpretation by orosius , who was preparing his readers for a conclusion that christian times were felicitous and who attributed athaulf 's apparent change of heart to the power of his love for galla placidia , the instrument of divine intervention in god 's plan for an eternal roman empire after the heads of sebastianus and jovinus arrived at honorius ' court in ravenna in late august , to be forwarded for display among other usurpers on the walls of carthage , relations between athaulf and honorius improved sufficiently for athaulf to cement them by marrying galla placidia at narbo in january 414 , but jordanes says he married her in italy , at forlì ( forum livii ) the authenticity of athaulf 's declaration at narbonne , as orosius reported it in a rhetorical history that was explicitly written '' against pagans '' ( it was completed in 417/18 ) has been doubted so in 411 constantius , the magister militum ( master of military ) of the western emperor , flavius augustus honorius , with gothic auxiliaries under ulfilas , crushed the gallic rebellion with a siege of arles therefore i have more prudently chosen the different glory of reviving the roman name with gothic vigour , and i hope to be acknowledged by posterity as the initiator of a roman restoration , since it is impossible for me to alter the character of this empire
