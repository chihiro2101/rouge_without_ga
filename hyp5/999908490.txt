while the original goal was preservation of the remains , in 1992 the society became the herefordshire and gloucestershire canal trust ( h & g canal trust ) and the aim became full restoration of the of canal and locks so that hereford would once again be linked with ledbury , dymock , newent and the rest of the inland waterway system at gloucester a feeder from the river frome to the summit level was completed in august 1842 , and the canal opened in stages as it was completed , with extensions to canon frome wharf in january 1843 , whithington wharf in february 1844 , and finally to hereford basin on 22 may 1845 the canal ran for from hereford basin through ledbury , dymock and newent to over , on the west channel of the river severn west of gloucester , with a short branch to the coal fields at gorsley in 2000 , the over canal basin ( adjacent to the river severn at over on the outskirts of gloucester , where the canal links with the inland waterways network ) was reconstructed entirely by volunteers from the canal trust and the national volunteer body the waterway recovery group this did not take place immediately , but on 30 june 1881 , half of the canal was closed , and sections of it were used for the course of the ledbury and gloucester railway the final to over falls by , and includes the oxenhall tunnel , which was not destroyed by the construction of the railway , as the railway company took the sensible decision to avoid the likely problems of enlarging it , and built a diversion to the south-west following partial restoration , which saw the trust working on the park , and herefordshire council , owners of the park , working on the canal , a short section at aylestone was used for a boat rally in may 2011 in 1838 , he proposed a new route for the final section , but the engineer james walker advised against it , and so in may 1839 , a new act of parliament was obtained , allowing the company to raise the money to complete the canal the canal trust used a legacy to purchase the site , which includes two cottages , some land , and a small section of the river severn as well as llanthony lock as with the first phase , it was the tunnel construction which caused the most problems , and ashperton tunnel , although only long , was affected by water flooding the work faces and by unstable rock , resulting in the need to construct a brick and stone lining in 1858 , the canal carried 47,560 tons of goods , and generated an income of £7,061 in 1860 , but some of this was derived from the carriage of materials to build railways in the area the wharf house is the herefordshire & gloucestershire canal trust 's new visitor centre , tea rooms by day and restaurant by night , situated at over ( close to the a417/a40 roundabout west of gloucester ) - all profits are donated to the h & g canal trust charity the price of coal in the region dropped from 24 shillings ( £1.20 ) per ton to 13/6 ( 68p ) but the coal was a good quality product which travelled up the canal from the river severn the canal company continued to receive rent from the great western railway , which it distributed to its shareholders as dividends , and was not formally wound up until the railways were nationalised in 1948 a series of articles about the canal were published in the local press in early 1983 , and this led to calls for a society to be formed which would raise public awareness of the canal
