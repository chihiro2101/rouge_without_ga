neurolinguistics is closely related to the field of psycholinguistics , which seeks to elucidate the cognitive mechanisms of language by employing the traditional techniques of experimental psychology ; today , psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic theories often inform one another , and there is much collaboration between the two fields although aphasiology is the historical core of neurolinguistics , in recent years the field has broadened considerably , thanks in part to the emergence of new brain imaging technologies ( such as pet and fmri ) and time-sensitive electrophysiological techniques ( eeg and meg ) , which can highlight patterns of brain activation as people engage in various language tasks ; brown , colin m phrenology had made the claim in the early 19th century that different brain regions carried out different functions and that language was mostly controlled by the frontal regions of the brain , but broca 's research was possibly the first to offer empirical evidence for such a relationship , and has been described as '' epoch-making '' and '' pivotal '' to the fields of neurolinguistics and cognitive science in general , theoretical linguists propose models to explain the structure of language and how language information is organized , psycholinguists propose models and algorithms to explain how language information is processed in the mind , and neurolinguists analyze brain activity to infer how biological structures ( populations and networks of neurons ) carry out those psycholinguistic processing algorithms for example , a landmark study by colin phillips and colleagues used the mismatch negativity as evidence that subjects , when presented with a series of speech sounds with acoustic parameters , perceived all the sounds as either /t/ or /d/ in spite of the acoustic variability , suggesting that the human brain has representations of abstract phonemes & mdash ; in other words , the subjects were '' hearing '' not the specific acoustic features , but only the abstract phonemes for example , experiments in sentence processing have used the elan , n400 , and p600 brain responses to examine how physiological brain responses reflect the different predictions of sentence processing models put forth by psycholinguists , such as janet fodor and lyn frazier 's '' serial '' model , see , for example , , which discusses how three brain responses reflect three stages of fodor and frazier 's model in addition to demonstrating which parts of the brain may subserve specific language tasks or computations , hemodynamic methods have also been used to demonstrate how the structure of the brain 's language architecture and the distribution of language-related activation may change over time , as a function of linguistic exposure in addition to pet and fmri , which show which areas of the brain are activated by certain tasks , researchers also use diffusion tensor imaging ( dti ) , which shows the neural pathways that connect different brain areas , filler ag , tsuruda js , richards tl , howe fa : images , apparatus , algorithms and methods electrophysiological techniques , in particular , emerged as a viable method for the study of language in 1980 with the discovery of the n400 , a brain response shown to be sensitive to semantic issues in language comprehension neurolinguistics research investigates several topics , including where language information is processed , how language processing unfolds over time , how brain structures are related to language acquisition and learning , and how neurophysiology can contribute to speech and language pathology these techniques are able to measure brain activity from one millisecond to the next , providing excellent temporal resolution , which is important in studying processes that take place as quickly as language comprehension and production neurolinguistic techniques are also used to study disorders and breakdowns in language , such as aphasia and dyslexia , and how they relate to physical characteristics of the brain since one of the focuses of this field is the testing of linguistic and psycholinguistic models , the technology used for experiments is highly relevant to the study of neurolinguistics these techniques provide high spatial resolution , allowing researchers to pinpoint the location of activity within the brain ; temporal resolution ( or information about the timing of brain activity ) , on the other hand , is poor , since the bold response happens much more slowly than language processing neurolinguists employ a variety of experimental techniques in order to use brain imaging to draw conclusions about how language is represented and processed in the brain the temporal ordering of specific patterns of brain activity may reflect discrete computational processes that the brain undergoes during language processing ; for example , one neurolinguistic theory of sentence parsing proposes that three brain responses ( the elan , n400 , and p600 ) are products of three different steps in syntactic and semantic processing early work in aphasiology also benefited from the early twentieth-century work of korbinian brodmann , who '' mapped '' the surface of the brain , dividing it up into numbered areas based on each area 's cytoarchitecture ( cell structure ) and function ; these areas , known as brodmann areas , are still widely used in neuroscience today research in first language acquisition has already established that infants from all linguistic environments go through similar and predictable stages ( such as babbling ) , and some neurolinguistics research attempts to find correlations between stages of language development and stages of brain development , caplan ( 1987 ) , p hemodynamic techniques take advantage of the fact that when an area of the brain works at a task , blood is sent to supply that area with oxygen ( in what is known as the blood oxygen level-dependent , or bold , response ) the logic behind tms and direct cortical stimulation is similar to the logic behind aphasiology : if a particular language function is impaired when a specific region of the brain is knocked out , then that region must be somehow implicated in that language function as such , it is a less invasive alternative to electrocorticography dces , which can be used for similar types of research but requires that the subject 's scalp be removed , and is thus only used on individuals who are already undergoing a major brain operation ( such as individuals undergoing surgery for epilepsy ) the coining of the term '' neurolinguistics '' is attributed to edith crowell trager , henri hecaen and alexandr luria , in the late 1940s and 1950s ; luria 's book '' problems in neurolinguistics '' is likely the first book with neurolinguistics in the title neurolinguists can also make new predictions about the structure and organization of language based on insights about the physiology of the brain , by '' generalizing from the knowledge of neurological structures to language structure '' neurolinguistics is historically rooted in the development in the 19th century of aphasiology , the study of linguistic deficits ( aphasias ) occurring as the result of brain damage
