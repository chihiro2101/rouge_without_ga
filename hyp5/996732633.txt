the cmovxx ( ‘ conditional move ’ ) instructions can move a value that is either the contents of a register or memory location into another register or not , according to some predicate logical condition xx on the flags register , xx being a flags predicate code as given in the condition for conditional jump instructions specific use of partial registers was a common performance optimization in the day , as it incurred no performance penalty on pre-p6 intel processors ; also , the dominant operating systems at the time of the pentium pro 's release were 16-bit dos and the mixed 16/32-bit windows 3.1x and windows 95 ( although the latter requires a 32-bit 80386 cpu , much of its code is still 16-bit for performance reasons , such as user.exe ) to take full advantage of the pentium pro 's p6 microarchitecture , a fully 32-bit os is needed , such as windows nt , linux , unix , or os/2 compared to risc microprocessors , the pentium pro , when introduced , slightly outperformed the fastest risc microprocessors on integer performance when running the specint95 benchmark , but floating-point performance was significantly lower , half of some risc microprocessors methods to circumvent this included setting vesa drawing to system memory instead of video memory in games such as quake , and later on utilities such as fastvid emerged , which could double performance in certain games by enabling the write combining features of the cpu this meant that a single , tiny flaw in either die made it necessary to discard the entire assembly , which was one of the reasons for the pentium pro 's relatively low production yield and high cost all versions of the chip were expensive , those with 1024 & nbsp ; kb being particularly so , since it required two 512 & nbsp ; kb cache dies as well as the processor die the process used to fabricate the pentium pro processor die and its separate cache memory die changed , leading to a combination of processes used in the same package : the 133 & nbsp ; mhz pentium pro prototype processor die was fabricated in a 0.6 & nbsp ; μm bicmos process the 166 , 180 , and 200 & nbsp ; mhz pentium pro processor die was fabricated in a 0.35 & nbsp ; μm bicmos process in 1998 , the 300/333 & nbsp ; mhz pentium ii overdrive processor for socket & nbsp ; 8 was released featuring 512 & nbsp ; kb of full-speed cache , it was produced by intel as a drop-in upgrade option for owners of pentium pro systems these specially packaged pentium ii xeon processors were used to upgrade asci red , which became the first computer to reach the teraflops performance mark with the pentium pro processor and then the first to exceed 2 teraflops after the upgrade to pentium ii xeon processors the intel 440fx chipset explicitly supported both pentium pro and pentium & nbsp ; ii processors , but the intel 440bx and later slot & nbsp ; 1 chipsets did not explicitly support the pentium pro , so the socket & nbsp ; 8 slockets did not see wide use slockets—in the form of socket 370 to slot & nbsp ; 1 adapters—saw renewed popularity when intel introduced socket & nbsp ; 370 celeron and pentium iii processors l1 cache : 8 , 8 & nbsp ; kb ( data , instructions ) l2 cache : 256 , 512 & nbsp ; kb ( one die ) or 1024 & nbsp ;

mhz , ( capable of 233 & nbsp ; mhz on some motherboards ) first release : november 1995 the design of the pentium pro bus was influenced by futurebus , the intel iapx 432 bus , and elements of the intel i960 bus the lead architect of i960 was superscalarity specialist fred pollack who was also the lead engineer of the intel iapx 432 and the lead architect of the i686 chip , the pentium pro while the pentium pro was not successful as a machine for the masses , due to poor 16-bit support for windows 95 , it did become highly successful in the file server space due to its advanced , integrated bus design , introducing many advanced features that had previously only been available in the pricey workstation segment into the commodity marketplace
