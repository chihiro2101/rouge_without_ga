however the latter expression , '' phase diagram '' , is more usually reserved in the physical sciences for a diagram showing the various regions of stability of the thermodynamic phases of a chemical system , which consists of pressure , temperature , and composition if a thermodynamic system consists of n particles , then a point in the 6n-dimensional phase space describes the dynamic state of every particle in that system , as each particle is associated with three-position variables and three momentum variables the phase space of a two-dimensional system is called a phase plane , which occurs in classical mechanics for a single particle moving in one dimension , and where the two variables are position and velocity when used in this sense , a phase is a region of phase space where the system in question is in , for example , the liquid phase , or solid phase , etc within the context of a model system in classical mechanics , the phase space coordinates of the system at any given time are composed of all of the system 's dynamic variables in a phase space , every degree of freedom or parameter of the system is represented as an axis of a multidimensional space ; a one-dimensional system is called a phase line , while a two-dimensional system is called a phase plane for every possible state of the system or allowed combination of values of the system 's parameters , a point is included in the multidimensional space more abstractly , in classical mechanics phase space is the cotangent bundle of configuration space , and in this interpretation the procedure above expresses that a choice of local coordinates on configuration space induces a choice of natural local darboux coordinates for the standard symplectic structure on a cotangent space one degree of freedom occurs when one has an autonomous ordinary differential equation in a single variable , dy/dt f ( y ) , with the resulting one-dimensional system being called a phase line , and the qualitative behaviour of the system being immediately visible from the phase line in this sense , as long as the particles are gibbs paradox , a point in phase space is said to be a microstate of the system thus , by expressing quantum mechanics in phase space ( the same ambit as for classical mechanics ) , the weyl map facilitates recognition of quantum mechanics as a deformation ( generalization ) of classical mechanics , with deformation parameter Ä§/s , where s is the action of the relevant process the phase space can also refer to the space that is parameterized by the macroscopic states of the system , such as pressure , temperature , etc
