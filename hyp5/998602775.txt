s parameswara iyer , was sree veerarama varman , a king of travancore from ad 1195 to 1208 while the pattu school flourished among certain sections of the society , the literature of the elite was composed in the curious mixture of sanskrit and malayalam which is referred to as manipravalam , mani meaning ruby ( malayalam ) and pravalam meaning coral ( sanskrit ) pp.78 lilathilakam , a work on grammar and rhetoric , written in the last quarter of the 14th century discusses the relationship between manipravalam and pattu as poetic forms the most representative of the early manipravalam works are the tales of courtesans ( achi charitams ) and the message poems ( sandesa kavyas ) the padya ( verse ) portion is in sanskrit metres and the gadya ( prose ) portion is mostly in dravidian metres the sandesa kavyas are an important poetic genre in sanskrit , and on the model of kalidasa 's meghadūta and lakshmidasa 's sukasandesa , a number of message poems came to be written first in manipravalam and later in pure malayalam while the manipravala poetry flourished as a diversion from the mainstream , the tradition set up by cheeraman of ramacharitamand the more enlightened among the anonymous folk poets was resumed and replenished by three writers commonly referred to as niranam poets , being niranam poets , sankara panikkar and rama panikkar the bhakti school was thus revived , and in the place of the excessive sensuality and eroticism of the manipravalam poets , the seriousness of the poetic vocation was reasserted by them the 15th century ce saw two paralleled movements in malayalam literature : one spearheaded by the manipravalam works , especially the champus , and the other emanating from the pattu school and adumbrated in cherusseri 's magnum opus , krishnagatha ( song of krishna ) with the writing of krishnagatha by cherusseri , the validity of the use of spoken malayalam for literary purposes received its ultimate justification unlike the language of ramacharitam and the works of the niranam poets , the language of krishnagatha marks the culmination of a stage of evolution the 16th century also saw the writing of some dramatic works in manipravalam and pure malayalam , bharatavakyam , often described as a choral narration , is a work in manipravalam which was used for stage performance the main development in the cultural field in kerala in the 17th century was the growth of a new form of visual art called kathakali , which brought into being a new genre of poetry called attakkatha consisting of the libretto used for a kathakali performance the earliest of the aattakathas is believed to be a cycle of eight ramayana stories ( collectively known as ramanattam ) , composed by kottarakkara tampuran and about whose date there is an ongoing controversy in the court of travancore king marthanda varma ( 1706–1758 ) and his successor dharma raja , there flourished a number of poets distinguished in several ways kunchan nambiar ( 1705–1770 ) , the founder of thullal and its rich literature , is often considered as the master of malayalam satirist poetry the word '' thullal '' literally means '' dance '' , but under this name nambiar devised a new style of verse narration with a little background music and dance-like swinging movement to wean the people away from the chakkiyar koothu , which was the art form popular till then there was a great lull in the field of literary creation in malayalam for nearly a century after the death of kunchan nambiar the works of christian missionaries like johann ernst hanxleden , 1699–1732 ) and paulinose patiri ( john philip wesdin , 1748–1806 ) also led to a widening of the range of topics and themes in malayalam literature the third quarter of the nineteenth century bore witness to the rise of a new school of poets devoted to the observation of life around them and the use of pure malayalam the major poets of the venmani school were venmani achhan nambudiripad ( 1817–1891 ) , venmani mahan nambudiripad ( 1844–1893 ) , poonthottam achhan nambudiri ( 1821–1865 ) , poonthottam mahan nambudiri ( 1857–1896 ) and the members of the kodungallur kovilakam ( royal family ) such as kodungallur kunjikkuttan thampuran the style of these poets became quite popular for a while and influenced even others who were not members of the group like velutheri kesavan vaidyar ( 1839–1897 ) and perunlli krishnan vaidyan ( 1863–1894 ) the venmani school pioneered a style of poetry that was associated with common day themes , and the use of pure malayalam rather than sanskrit the establishment of colleges for imparting english education , the translation of the bible and other religious works , the compilation of dictionaries and grammars , the formation of the text book committee , the growth of printing presses , the starting of newspapers and periodicals , the introduction of science and technology , the beginning of industrialization and the awakening of social and political consciousness : these constitute the giant strides towards modernisation he wrote over twenty books in malayalam , the most important of which are a malayalam-english dictionary , a grammar of malayalam , keralappazhama and pazhamcholmala his major works include mayurasandesam ( peacock message ) and the translations of kalidasa 's abhijñānaśākuntalam ( which got him the title of kerala kalidasa ) , and of von limburg brower 's akbar a professor in the university college thiruvananthapuram , he had to modernize the process of teaching malayalam language and literature ; this made him write books on grammar and rhetoric ( which earned him the title of kerala pāṇini ) and eventually prepare the ground for an enlightened renaissance in malayalam poetry and literary criticism parameswara iyer ( 1877–1949 : author of umakeralam ) and vallathol narayana menon ( 1879–1958 : author of chitrayogam ) , all paid their obeisance to this neoclassicist trend the developments in prose at this time were very significant , vengayil kunhiraman nayanar ( 1861–1895 ) , more famous under his pseudonym kesari , was one of the first to explore the essay form in malayalam kunhiraman menon ( 1854–1936 ) and appu nedungadi ( 1866–1934 ) at kozhikode ) , kerala sanchari ( after 1898 under the editorship of murkoth kumaran ) and the english journal malabar spectator raman pillai 's marthandavarma ( 1891 ) had many distinctions : it was the first historical novel in any south indian languages , first novel from travancore , first malayalam novel to be a part of a trilogy and the first malayalam novel to have a masculine title the post-independence period saw a fresh start in the history of longer fiction in malayalam as in many other indian languages , parallel to the evolution of post-world war fiction in other parts of the world kesava dev , who was a communist in the thirties and forties turned away from diehard ideologies and wrote a symbolic novel called arku vendi ? ( for whose sake ? ) in 1950 , challenging the philosophy of stalinist liquidation of political enemies pottekkatt and vaikom muhammad basheer , who had not dabbled in politics , the continuity is marked in the former 's vishakanyaka ( poison maid , 1948 ) and the latter 's ntuppuppakkoranendarnnu ( my grandpa had an elephant , 1951 ) the non-political social or domestic novel was championed by uroob with his ummachu ( 1955 ) and sundarikalum sundaranmarum ( men and women of charm , 1958 )
