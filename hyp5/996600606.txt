the direction in which the propagation of the charge tends is usually constant throughout a pyroelectric material , but , in some materials , this direction can be changed by a nearby electric field despite being pyroelectric , novel materials such as boron aluminum nitride ( baln ) and boron gallium nitride ( bgan ) have zero piezoelectric response for strain along the c-axis at certain compositions , the two properties being closely related pyroelectricity is measured as the change in net polarization ( a vector ) proportional to a change in temperature spontaneous polarization is temperature dependent , so a good perturbation probe is a change in temperature which induces a flow of charge to and from the surfaces the pyroelectric coefficient may be described as the change in the spontaneous polarization vector with temperature : : p_i \frac where p i ( cm −2 k −1 ) is the vector for the pyroelectric coefficient richards , theophrastus : on stones ( columbus , ohio : ohio state university , 1956 ) , page 51 , paragraph 28 of the original text : '' it smaragdos is remarkable in its powers , and so is the lyngourion i.e it has the power of attraction , just as amber has , and some say that it not only attracts straws and bits of wood , but also copper and iron , if the pieces are thin , as diokles used to explain in 1747 linnaeus first related the phenomenon to electricity ( he called tourmaline lapidem electricum , '' the electric stone '' ) , carl von linné ( '' linnaeus '' ) , flora zeylanica : sistens plantas indicas zeylonae insulae the flora of ceylon : consisting of indian plants of the island of ceylon ( stockholm ( '' holmiae '' ) , sweden : laurentii salvii , 1747 ) , page 8 any dielectric material develops a dielectric polarization ( electrostatics ) when an electric field is applied , but a substance which has such a natural charge separation even in the absence of a field is called a polar material if this dipole moment changes with the effect of applied temperature changes , applied electric field , or applied pressure , the material is pyroelectric , ferroelectric , or piezoelectric , respectively the ferroelectric effect is exhibited by materials which possess an electric polarization in the absence of an externally applied electric field such that the polarization can be reversed if the electric field is reversed the piezoelectric effect is exhibited by crystals ( such as quartz or ceramic ) for which an electric voltage across the material appears when pressure is applied similar to pyroelectric effect , the phenomenon is due to the asymmetric structure of the crystals that allows ions to move more easily along one axis than the others pyroelectricity should not be confused with thermoelectricity : in a typical demonstration of pyroelectricity , the whole crystal is changed from one temperature to another , and the result is a temporary voltage across the crystal in a typical demonstration of thermoelectricity , one part of the device is kept at one temperature and the other part at a different temperature , and the result is a permanent voltage across the device as long as there is a temperature difference progress has been made in creating artificial pyroelectric materials , usually in the form of a thin film , using gallium nitride ( gan ) , caesium nitrate ( csno 3 ) , polyvinyl fluorides , derivatives of phenylpyridine , and cobalt phthalocyanine one group calculated that a pyroelectric in an ericsson cycle could reach 50 % of carnot efficiency , while a different study found a material that could , in theory , reach 84-92 % of carnot efficiency ( these efficiency values are for the pyroelectric itself , ignoring losses from heating and cooling the thin film , other heat-transfer losses , and all other losses elsewhere in the system )
