intestacy has a limited application in those jurisdictions that follow civil law or roman law because the concept of a will is itself less important ; the doctrine of forced heirship automatically gives a deceased person 's next-of-kin title to a large part ( forced estate ) of the estate 's property by operation of law , beyond the power of the deceased person to defeat or exceed by testamentary gift where a person dies without leaving a will , the rules of succession of the person 's place of habitual residence or of their domicile often apply , but it is also common for the principality where the property is located to have jurisdiction regardless of the decedent 's residence or domicile the distribution of the property of an intestate decedent is the responsibility of the administrator ( or personal representative ) of the estate : typically the administrator is chosen by the court having jurisdiction over the decedent 's property , and is frequently ( but not always ) a person nominated by a majority of the decedent 's heirs is legally assigned ) to the crown ( via the bona vacantia division of the treasury solicitor ) or to the duchy of cornwall or duchy of lancaster when the deceased was a resident of either ; in limited cases a discretionary distribution might be made by one of these bodies to persons who would otherwise be without entitlement under strict application of the rules of inheritance property goes first or in major part to a spouse , then to children and their descendants ; if there are no descendants , the line of inheritance goes back up the family tree to the parents , the siblings , the siblings ' descendants , the grandparents , the parents ' siblings , and the parents ' siblings ' descendants , and usually so on further to the more remote degrees of kinship these are known as forced heirship rights and are not typically found in common law jurisdictions , where the rules of succession without a will ( intestate succession ) play a back-up role where an individual has not ( or has not fully ) exercised his or her right to dispose of property in a will they will receive the following : all property passing to them by survivorship ( such as the deceased 's share in the jointly owned family home ) ; all property passing to them under the terms of a trust ( such as a life insurance policy ) ; a statutory legacy of a fixed sum ( being a larger sum where the deceased left no children ) ; and a life interest in half of the remaining estate these rules have been supplemented by the discretionary provisions of the inheritance ( provision for family and dependants ) act 1975 so that fair provision can be made for a dependent spouse or other relative where the strict divisions set down in the intestacy rules would produce an unfair result , for example by providing additional support for a dependent minor or disabled child vis-a-vis an adult child who has a career and no longer depends on their parent many states have adopted all or part of the uniform probate code , but often with local variations , in ohio , the law of intestate succession has been modified significantly from the common law , and has been essentially codified the children ( or more distant relatives if there are no children ) of the deceased will be entitled to half of the estate remaining immediately and the remaining half on the death of the surviving spouse
