a regular star polygon is represented by its schläfli symbol a polyhedron is stellated by extending the edges or face planes of a polyhedron until they meet again to form a new polyhedron or compound in 1619 kepler defined stellation for polygons and polyhedra as the process of extending edges or faces until they meet to form a new polygon or polyhedron under miller 's rules we find : there are no stellations of the tetrahedron , because all faces are adjacent there are no stellations of the cube , because non-adjacent faces are parallel and thus can not be extended to meet in new edges there is 1 stellation of the octahedron , the stella octangula there are 3 stellations of the dodecahedron : the small stellated dodecahedron , the great dodecahedron and the great stellated dodecahedron , all of which are kepler–poinsot polyhedra in this system the process of extending edges to create a new figure is called stellation , that of extending faces is called greatening and that of extending cells is called aggrandizement ( this last does not apply to polyhedra ) they ensure , among other things , that the rotational symmetry of the original polyhedron is preserved , and that each stellation is different in outward appearance some polyhedronists take the view that stellation is a two-way process , such that any two polyhedra sharing the same face planes are stellations of each other for a symmetrical polyhedron , these cells will fall into groups , or sets , of congruent cells – we say that the cells in such a congruent set are of the same type the face planes of a polyhedron may divide space into many such cells , and as the stellation process continues then more of these cells will be enclosed alongside from his contributions to mathematics , magnus wenninger is described in the context of the relationship of mathematics and art as making '' especially beautiful '' models of complex stellated polyhedra m also corresponds to the number of vertices around the circle to get from one end of a given edge to the other , starting at 1 most progress has been made based on the notion that stellation is the reciprocal or dual process to facetting , whereby parts are removed from a polyhedron without creating any new vertices here we usually add the rule that all of the original face planes must be present in the stellation , i.e '' in a fully supported stellation there are no such overhangs , and all visible parts of a face are seen from the same side as such there are some quite reasonable stellations of the icosahedron that are not part of their list – one was identified by james bridge in 1974 , while some '' miller stellations '' are questionable as to whether they should be regarded as stellations at all – one of the icosahedral set comprises several quite disconnected cells floating symmetrically in space generalising miller 's rules there are : 4 stellations of the rhombic dodecahedron 187 stellations of the triakis tetrahedron 358,833,097 stellations of the rhombic triacontahedron 17 stellations of the cuboctahedron ( 4 are shown in wenninger 's polyhedron models ) an unknown number of stellations of the icosidodecahedron ; there are 7071671 non-chiral stellations , but the number of chiral stellations is unknown
