each cms user has control over a private virtual machine & ndash ; a simulated copy of the underlying physical computer & ndash ; in which cms runs as a stand-alone operating system an exceptionally strong user community , first established in the self-support days of cp/cms but remaining active after the launch of vm , made substantial contributions to the operating system , and mitigated the difficulties of running ibm 's '' other operating system '' this approach has remained consistent through the years , and is based on : full virtualization , used to create multiple independent virtual machines that each completely simulate the underlying hardware paravirtualization , used to provide a hypervisor interface that cms uses to access vm services ; this is implemented by the non-virtualized diag ( diagnose ) instruction more details on how cms interacts with the virtual machine environment can be found in the vm and cp/cms articles ibm provided cp/cms '' as is '' & ndash ; without any support , in source code form , as part of the ibm type-iii library ) later in 1967 , cp/cms became generally available on the ibm system/360 model 67 , where , although the new control program cp-67 was a substantial re-implementation of cp-40 , cms remained essentially the same this can be done by issuing the command '' ipl cms '' ( '' ipl '' initial program load , traditional ibm jargon for booting a machine ) ; though this is normally done automatically for the user at the time , the acronym meant '' cambridge monitor system '' ( but also : '' console monitor system '' ) cms was originally built as a stand-alone operating system , capable of running on a bare machine ( though of course nobody would choose to do so ) in 1972 , ibm released its vm/370 operating system , a re-implementation of cp/cms for the system/370 , in an announcement that also added virtual memory hardware to the system/370 series vm went through a series of versions , and is still in use today as z/vm vm was not one of ibm 's '' strategic '' operating systems , which were primarily the os and dos families , and it suffered from ibm political infighting over time-sharing versus batch processing goals by the late 1970s , however , most vm users were connecting via full-screen terminals & ndash ; particularly the ibm 3270 , the ubiquitous transaction processing terminal on ibm mainframes cms was originally developed as part of ibm 's cp/cms operating system despite this lack of support from ibm , cp/cms achieved great success as a time-sharing platform ; by 1972 , there were some 44 cp/cms systems in use , including commercial sites that resold access to cp/cms
