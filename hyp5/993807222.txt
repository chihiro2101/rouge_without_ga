riddims are the instrumental backgrounds of reggae , lovers rock , dub , ragga , dancehall , soca , bouyon , and also reggaeton , which itself is largely based on the dem bow and poco riddims by steely & clevie from the early 1990s , feature a riddim , such as ivy queen and sasha 's '' dat sexy body '' , which uses the bookshelf riddim produced by tony kelly of the k-licious reggae label these aspects of jamaican music are expressed visually through the dancehall choreography and its african inspired folk traditions , which emphasize earthly connection through flat-footed stamping and “ bumper-grinding sexually explicit choreography , where the bass note is struck by the body itself—displaying its fecundity and celebrating its fertility ” this bass culture is also embodied sonically by the music ’ s heartbeat , the bass lines often described as riddims , produced in the late 1960s and early 1970s different producers often develop their own versions of the same riddim , such as the punaany riddim , which has distinct versions crafted by steely & clevie and by ward 21 , the buzz riddim , which was produced by troyton rami & roger mackenzie and officially launched dancehall rapper sean paul into superstardom ( '' gim me the light '' from the buzz riddim won them their first grammy for best reggae album ) other songs have inspired riddims as well , such as george michael ’ s song “ faith '' , which became a riddim of the same name , the cure 's song '' close to me '' , which became the cure riddim , and r many riddims are named after the song that was recorded on that instrumental track for the first time ( or , in some cases , the song that becomes the most popular on a given riddim ) thus , for example , '' diwali '' is the name not of a song , but of a riddim created by steven '' lenky '' marsden , subsequently used as the basis for several songs , such as sean paul 's '' get busy '' and bounty killer 's '' sufferer a specific dj , dj u-roy , revolutionized the practice with studio recordings of these dj voicings as his recordings skyrocketed on the charts in jamaica in the 70s , thus leading to the beginning stages of dancehall there 's fluidity in the fact that a riddim could have so many different voicings attached and on the flip side , a certain voicing could have so many different riddims which again reflects the diasporic transference in most cases , the term riddim is used in reference to the entire background track or rhythm section , but in older roots riddims , riddim is used to reference a certain bass line and drum pattern other live performances like at clubs or along the streets feature the use of sound systems in which there are usually medleys of different songs that all use the instrumental accompaniment since the 1980s , however , riddims started to be originally composed by producers/beatmakers , who give the riddims original names and , typically , contract artists to voice over them
