in dresden schütz sowed the seeds of what is now the sächsische staatskapelle dresden , but left there on several occasions ; in 1628 he went to venice again , where he met and studied with claudio monteverdi schütz moved back to weißenfels , in a retirement he had to beg for , to live with his sister ( the house is now a fine museum of his life ) , but the electoral court often called him back to dresden ) his pupils included heinrich albert , christoph bernhard , anton colander , constantin christian dedekind , carlo farina , johann wilhelm furchheim , johann kaspar horn , caspar kittel , christoph kittel , johann klemm , adam krieger , johann jakob loewe ( or löwe ) , johann nauwach , david pohle , philipp stolle , johann theile , clemens thieme , johann vierdanck , matthias weckmann , friedrich werner , friedrich von westhoff representative works include his psalmen davids ( psalms of david , opus 2 ) , cantiones sacrae ( opus 4 ) , three books of symphoniae sacrae , die sieben worte jesu christi am kreuz ( the seven words of jesus christ on the cross ) , three passion settings and the christmas story schütz 's music , while starting off in the most progressive styles early in his career , eventually grew into a style that is simple and almost austere , culminating with his late passion settings practical considerations were certainly responsible for part of this change : the thirty years ' war had devastated the musical infrastructure of germany , and it was no longer practical or even possible to put on the gigantic works in the venetian style which marked his earlier period his funeral music '' musikalische exequien '' ( 1636 ) for his noble friend heinrich posthumus of reuss is considered a masterpiece , and is known today as the first german requiem above all , his music displays extreme sensitivity to the accents and meaning of the text , which is often conveyed using special technical figures drawn from musica poetica , themselves drawn from or created in analogy to the verbal figures of classical rhetoric however , as noted above , the composer 's style became simpler in his later works , which make less frequent use of the kind of distantly related chords and licences found in such pieces as '' was hast du verwirket '' ( swv 307 ) from kleine geistliche konzerte ii beyond the early book of madrigals , almost no secular music by schütz has survived , save for a few domestic songs ( arien ) and occasional commemorative items ( such as wie wenn der adler sich aus seiner klippe schwingt ( swv 434 ) , and no purely instrumental music at all ( unless one counts the short instrumental movement entitled '' sinfonia '' that encloses the dialogue of die sieben worte ) , even though he had a reputation as one of the finest organists in germany schütz was of great importance in bringing new musical ideas to germany from italy , and thus had a large influence on the german music which was to follow the style of the north german organ school derives largely from schütz ( as well as from the dutchman jan pieterszoon sweelinck ) ; a century later this music was to culminate in the work of j.s 58–61 the following are major published works ; most of these contain multiple pieces of music ; single published works are also listed in the complete work list , including major works such as the seven last words , and the passions ( according to matthew , luke , and john )
