the bird 's liking for mistletoe berries is also indicated by its english name , '' mistle '' being an old name for the plant a mitochondrial dna study identified the mistle thrush 's closest relatives as the similarly plumaged song and chinese thrushes ; these three species are early offshoots from the eurasian lineage of turdus thrushes after they spread north from africa at least eight subspecies have been proposed , but the differences between them are mainly clinal , with birds being paler and less densely spotted in the east of the range it has pale grey-brown upperparts , the chin and throat are greyish-white , and the yellowish-buff breast and off-white belly are marked with round black spots juvenile birds have a partial moult , replacing their head , body , and covert feathers ; this is completed by october , although the start of the moult depends on when the chicks hatched the tone resembles that of the song thrush or blackbird , but compared to its relatives the mistle thrush 's repertoire is less varied and the delivery is slower the song is , however , much louder , often audible up to 2 & nbsp ; km ( 2,000 & nbsp ; yd ) away the male is most vocal in the early morning , and its tendency to sing after , and sometimes during , wet and windy weather led to the old name '' stormcock '' the mistle thrush breeds in much of europe and temperate asia , although it is absent from the treeless far north , and its range becomes discontinuous in southeast europe , turkey and the middle east the mistle thrush is a partial migrant : birds from the north and east of the range wintering in the milder areas of europe and north africa the mistle thrush is found in a wide range of habitats containing trees , including forests , plantations , hedges and town parks in germany and elsewhere in central europe , it was found only in coniferous forest until the mid-1920s when its range rapidly expanded , first into farmland , and then to suburbs and urban parks mistle thrushes are found as individuals or pairs for much of the year , although families forage together in late summer , and groups may merge to form large flocks when food sources are plentiful the nest is usually built in a tree in the fork of a branch or against the trunk , although hedges , ledges on buildings and cliff faces may also be used the common chaffinch often nests close to a mistle thrush , the vigilance of the chaffinch and the aggressive behaviour of the thrush benefiting both species the thrush 's nest is a large cup of sticks , dry grass , roots and moss , coated on the inside with a layer of mud and lined with fine grass and leaves the clutch is typically three to five eggs ( range two to six ) , which are usually whitish-buff or greenish-blue and are spotted with red , purple or brown there are normally two broods , except in siberia , where there is only one , the male feeding the fledglings from the first brood while the female sits on the second clutch in a study carried out in britain , the survival rate for juveniles in their first year is 57 & nbsp ; per cent , and the adult annual survival rate is 62 & nbsp ; per cent life expectancy is typically three years , but the maximum age recorded from bird ringing recoveries is 21 & nbsp ; years and 3 & nbsp ; months for a bird shot in switzerland plant food includes the fruits and seeds of bushes and trees , mainly holly , yew , ivy and mistletoe , but also , for example , blackberry , cherry , elder , hawthorn , olive and rose adults will roam up to 1 & nbsp ; km ( approximately 1,100 & nbsp ; yards ) from the nest on pasture or ploughed land individuals or pairs will defend one or more fruit-bearing trees throughout the winter , with preference shown for trees which host mistletoe , the parasitic plant from which the bird derives its name although the thrush normally feeds on the ground and from low bushes , the defence of this resource conserves fruit for later in the season when other food items become scarce as its name implies , the mistle thrush is important in propagating the mistletoe , an aerial parasite , which needs its seeds to be deposited on the branches of suitable trees the highly nutritious fruits are favoured by the thrush , which digests the flesh leaving the sticky seeds to be excreted , possibly in a suitable location for germination the mistle thrush is predated upon by a wide variety of birds of prey , including the boreal owl , korpim√§ki & hakkarainen ( 2012 ) p it expanded rapidly into lowland and coastal areas of europe during the 18th century and the first half of the 19th century , colonising areas where it was formerly rare or absent , such as ireland ( where it first bred in 1807 ) , scotland and the netherlands given its high numbers and very large range , this thrush is therefore classified by the international union for conservation of nature as being of least concern desiderius erasmus 's early sixteenth-century collection of latin proverbs included turdus malum sibi ipse cacat , ( the thrush himself excretes his own trouble ) , which refers to the use of the sticky mistletoe berries favoured by this species as an ingredient in birdlime , used to trap birds mistle thrush and alpine chough , by giovanni da udine , an artist who worked in raphael 's studio in the 16th century , was a sketch for his bird with garland and fruit , and this in turn was the basis for a raphael fresco in the apostolic palace the early renaissance poem '' the harmony of birds '' features a thrusshe ( mistle thrush ) singing the phrase '' sanctus , sanctus '' , distinguishing the bird from the song thrush , the mauys or throstle '' holm thrush '' , '' hollin cock '' and '' holm cock '' are based on obsolete names for the holly tree , which may be defended by the thrush in winter for its berries in frances hodgson burnett 's the secret garden , dickon reassures mary lennox that he will keep his knowledge of the garden secret by comparing her to a mistle thrush in defence of its nest , recognising his privilege in sharing her secret : '' if tha ' was a missel thrush an ' showed me where thy nest was , does tha ' think i 'd tell any one ? not me , '' he said '' the bird also features in the lyrics of the decemberists ' song '' wo n't want for love ( margaret in the taiga ) '' from their 2009 album the hazards of love : '' mistlethrush , mistlethrush , lay me down in the underbrush , my naked feet grow weary with the dusk '' ( catalogue for the exhibition '' raphael to renoir : drawings from the collection of jean bonna '' , held at the metropolitan museum of art , new york , from 21 january to 26 april 2009 , and at the national gallery of scotland , edinburgh , from 5 june to 6 september 2009 )
