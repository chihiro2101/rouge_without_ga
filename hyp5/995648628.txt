on the other hand , peru did not develop a livestock-based economy , and thus did not need to breed for the speed or agility characteristic of stock horses a decline in the use of the peruvian paso horse was seen in the southern part of peru in the early 1900s , following the building of major highways that allowed motor travel to replace the use of the horse this changed with the harsh agrarian reforms instituted by the government of juan velasco alvarado in the late 1960s that had a devastating effect on the peruvian paso horse within peru because interest in the peruvian paso horse was growing in the united states and central america at the same time , many of the finest peruvian paso horses were exported , leading to a period where it appeared the peruvian paso horse would fade in its homeland the peruvian paso has been declared a patrimonio cultural ( cultural heritage ) of peru in an attempt to shore up the breed within the country there are two official gaits , called the '' paso llano '' or '' even step '' , and the '' sobreandando '' which is a bit closer in timing to the pace instead of four equal beats , the lateral beats are closer together in a 1-2 , 3-4 rhythm , with the pause between the forefoot of one side to the rear of the other side is longer the gait supplies essentially none of the vertical bounce that is characteristic of the trot , and hence posting ( moving up and down with each of the horse 's footfalls ) is unnecessary it is also very stable , as the execution of the gait means there are always two , and sometimes three , feet on the ground a unique trait of the peruvian paso gait is termino & mdash ; an outward swinging leg action , originating from the shoulder , in which the front lower legs roll to the outside during the stride forward , similar to a swimmer 's arms br√≠o describes a somewhat contradictory temperament , which combines arrogance , spirit , and the sense of always being on parade , with a willingness to please the rider the two best-known and most important events are the national horse competition caballo de paso peruano held in pachacamac and at the trujillo spring festival during the months of september and october in trujillo city and during the international marinera festival in january because of the shared word paso , a close relationship between the peruvian paso and the paso fino breed is incorrectly assumed the peruvian paso has been called the '' national horse '' of peru on the other hand , the paso fino was developed from horses throughout northern latin america and the caribbean , with major centers of development in colombia and puerto rico the peruvian paso is also increasingly referred to in north america as the '' peruvian horse '' in an attempt to differentiate its breed from that of the paso fino registries and related organizations north american peruvian horse association - national association of breeders and owners of peruvian paso horses ( peru-spanish language ) peruvian horse association of canada ( canada ) guatemala peruvian paso horse association ( guatemala-spanish language ) paso peruano europe ( europe ) - paso club international ( europe ) - educational materials history of the peruvian paso horse - riding the peruvian horse ( equitation guide ) - proper peruvian show ring equitation - publications peruvian horse quarterly ( magazine ) - made in peru ( magazine ) - orgullo del peru ( magazine ) paso llano ( magazine ) -
