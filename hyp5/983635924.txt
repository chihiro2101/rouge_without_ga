the united kingdom was considered an unsuitable location for air training , due to the possibility of enemy attack , the strain caused by wartime traffic at airfields and the unpredictable weather , so the plan called for the facilities in the dominions to train british and each other 's aircrews the 1939 agreement stated that the training was to be similar to that of the raf : three initial training schools , thirteen elementary flying training schools , sixteen service flying training schools , ten air observer schools , ten bombing and gunnery schools , two air navigation schools and four wireless schools were to be created the agreement called for the training of nearly 50,000 aircrew each year , for as long as necessary : 22,000 aircrew from great britain , 13,000 from canada , 11,000 from australia and 3,300 from new zealand article xv of the agreement stipulated that graduates belonging to dominion air forces , where they were assigned to service with the raf , should be placed in new squadrons identified with the raaf , rcaf and rnzaf some pre-war/regular raaf and rcaf squadrons also served under raf operational control , while new zealand and rhodesian personnel were frequently assigned to raf squadrons with the honorifics of '' ( new zealand ) '' and '' ( rhodesia ) '' in their names most of the dominions and other territories did not award their own separate citizenship until after the war , in canada 's case 1946 , with 1948 for australia , and 1949 for new zealand prior to the inception of the empire air training scheme ( as it was commonly known in australia ) , the raaf trained only about 50 pilots per year under the air training agreement , australia undertook to provide 28,000 aircrew over three years , representing 36 % of the total number trained by the bcatp during 1940 , royal australian air force ( raaf ) schools were established across australia to support eats in initial training , elementary flying training , service flying training , air navigation , air observer , bombing and gunnery and wireless air gunnery on 14 november 1940 , the first contingent to graduate from advanced training in canada embarked for britain , following the outbreak of the pacific war in december 1941 , the majority of raaf aircrews completed their training in australia and served with raaf units in the south west pacific theatre a relatively large number ( given the tiny size and population ) of islanders from the british colony of bermuda ( now termed a british overseas territory , and as such neither then part of the old commonwealth of dominions nor today a member of the commonwealth of nations , other than through britain 's membership ) served as air and ground crew in the royal flying corps and the royal air force during the first world war despite the importance of the royal naval dockyard and the use of the colony ( located 640 miles off north carolina ) in both world wars as a forming-up point for trans-atlantic convoys , attempts to raise a royal air force reserve in the colony from raf veterans between the wars did not meet with success nonetheless , with the outbreak of the second world war ( the first bermudian to be killed in the war was flying officer grant ede , dfc , a fighter pilot lost in the 8 june 1940 , sinking of , during the battle of norway ) , it was decided to create a flying school on darrell 's island ( where a marine air station had been built in the 1930s to enable imperial airways and pan american world airways to operate flights between the united states and bermuda , and onward across the atlantic ) , which was taken over as an raf air station for the duration of the war the purpose of the bermuda flying school was to train local pilots for the air ministry , which would assign them to the raf or the fleet air arm the school was placed under the command of major cecil montgomery-moore , dfc , the commanding officer of the bermuda volunteer engineers ( bve ) , who had transferred from the bermuda volunteer rifle corps ( bvrc ) to become a royal flying corps fighter pilot during the first world war the bfs only accepted applicants who were already serving in one of the part-time army units of the bermuda garrison ( only whites were accepted , barring most of the potential applicants from the bermuda militia artillery and the bermuda militia infantry , which recruited from the coloured population , although a number of coloured bermudians from these units were to become aircrew after the raf 's bar on coloured recruitment was lifted in 1943 ) , ‘ uncle hunky ’ , last surviving black bermudian to fight with the raf in wwii , dies at age of 90 , by kim sengupta wednesday , 22 june , 2011 although the school was originally run as a purely local effort , under the colonial government of bermuda , it was quickly incorporated into the commonwealth air training plan while most of the pilots it trained continued to come from the local population , eight citizens of the united states of america who volunteered to serve with the royal air force were sent to bermuda to train at the bermuda flying school by 1942 , the air ministry had a glut of trained pilots , resulting from the fear created by the blitz and the battle of britain although the school was closed , bertram work and major montgomery-moore oversaw the conversion of its administration into a recruiting arm , the bermuda flying committee , for the royal canadian air force ( rcaf ) , sending sixty aircrew candidates to that service before the war 's end canada was chosen as the primary location for '' the plan '' because of its ideal weather , wide open spaces suitable for flight and navigation training – sometimes on a large scale , ample supplies of fuel , industrial facilities for the production of trainer aircraft , parts and supplies , the lack of any threat from either the luftwaffe or japanese fighter aircraft and its relative proximity to both the european and pacific wars for initial training biplanes , as one example of the wide range of american and british aircraft designs used for canadian-based training facilities , pilots might have started their initial flight training on both british and canadian-produced examples of the tiger moth , the boeing stearman from the nearby united states , or even the indigenously designed and produced fleet finch biplane yet another negotiation point was the british expectation that the raf would absorb canadian air training graduates without restrictions , as in world war one , and distribute them across the raf the rcaf would run the plan in canada , but to satisfy raf concerns , robert leckie , a senior raf commander ( at the time in charge of raf squadrons in malta ) and a canadian , was posted to ottawa as director of training at its height of the british commonwealth air training plan , 131,533 allied pilots and aircrew were trained in canada , 72,835 of which were canadian at the conclusion of the war , over 167,000 students , including over 50,000 pilots , had trained in canada under the program from may 1940 to march 1945 during the war , the rnzaf contributed 2,743 fully trained pilots to serve with the raf in europe , the middle east , and far east in 1940 , before the british commonwealth air training plan was fully developed , new zealand also trained 183 observers and 395 air gunners for the raf with the establishment of the joint air training scheme ( jats ) 38 south african–based air schools were employed to train royal air force , saaf and other allied air and ground crews under this scheme , the saaf , by september 1941 , increased the total number of military aircraft to 1,709 while the personnel strength had grown to 31,204 , including 956 pilots on the outbreak of war in september 1939 , the government of southern rhodesia made an offer to the british air ministry to run a flying school and train personnel to man three squadrons ( 44 , 237 and 266 ( rhodesia ) squadrons ) , which was duly accepted the original programme of an initial training wing and six schools was increased to 10 flying training schools and bombing , navigation and gunnery school and a school for the training of flying instructors as well as additional schools for bomb aimers , navigators and air gunners , including stations at cranbourne ( salisbury ) , norton , gweru and heany ( near bulawayo ) the trainees came mainly from great britain but also from australia , canada , south africa , new zealand , usa , yugoslavia , greece , france , poland , czechoslovakia , kenya , uganda , tanganyika , fiji and malta the british commonwealth air training plan illustrated that the commonwealth still had some military meaning during the second world war and was one of canada 's major contributions to the early war effort canada became , during the second world war , one of the great air training centres contributing more than 130,000 trained aircrew to the allied cause on the third anniversary of the plan president roosevelt enthused that the bcatp had transformed canada into the '' aerodrome of democracy '' , a play on his earlier description of the united states as '' the arsenal of democracy as canada was the main participant , the legacy of the plan there included a strong postwar aviation sector and many new or improved airports across the country , the majority of which are still in use the classic bcatp airport consisted of three runways , each typically 2,500 & nbsp ; ft ( 760 m ) in length , class a airfield so that aircraft could always land ( more-or-less ) into the wind – that was critically important at a time when most light training aircraft ( such as the north american harvard ) were taildraggers , which are difficult to land in strong cross-winds the final report of the bcatp supervisory board calculated that '' more than 3,750 members of the raf , raaf , rnzaf and allied nationals under raf quotas married canadian girls , '' many of whom remained in canada to raise families in 1959 , queen elizabeth ii unveiled the ottawa memorial , a monument erected to '' ( commemorate ) by name , some 800 men and women who lost their lives while serving or training with the air forces of the commonwealth in canada , the west indies and the united states and who have no known grave the museum is dedicated to the preservation of the history of the british commonwealth air training plan and serves as a unique memorial to those airmen who trained and served , and especially those who died , while serving their country in the air war of 1939–1945 the commonwealth air training plan may also be regarded as the precursor of post-war international air training schemes in canada , many of them involving personnel from other nato powers later bilateral arrangements with individual nato powers ( 1959–1983 ) , the military training assistance plan , which has trained aircrews from developing countries since 1964 and nato flying training in canada ( nftc ) , since 1998 , a partnership of the canadian forces , bombardier aerospace corporation and
