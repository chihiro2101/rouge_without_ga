first , silicon is treated with hydrogen chloride at about 300 & nbsp ; °c to produce trichlorosilane , hsicl 3 , along with hydrogen gas , according to the chemical equation : : si + 3 hcl → hsicl 3 + h 2 the trichlorosilane is then converted to a mixture of silane and silicon tetrachloride an alternative industrial process for the preparation of very high purity silane , suitable for use in the production of semiconductor grade silicon , starts with metallurgical grade silicon , hydrogen , and silicon tetrachloride and involves a complex series of redistribution reactions ( producing byproducts that are recycled in the process ) and distillations another commercial production of silane involves reduction of silicon dioxide ( sio 2 ) under al and h 2 gas in a mixture of nacl and aluminum chloride ( alcl 3 ) at high pressures : shriver and atkins hence , m ii si with their zigzag chains of si 2 − anions ( containing two lone pairs of electrons on each si anion that can accept protons ) yield the polymeric hydride ( sih 2 ) x still other industrial routes to silane involve reduction of sif 4 with sodium hydride ( nah ) or reduction of sicl 4 with lithium aluminum hydride ( lialh 4 ) yet another small-scale route for the production of silane is from the action of sodium amalgam on dichlorosilane , sih 2 cl 2 , to yield monosilane along with some yellow polysilicon hydride ( sih ) x however , the difficulties in explaining the available ( often contradictory ) combustion data are ascribed to the fact that silane itself is stable and that the natural formation of larger silanes during production , as well as the sensitivity of combustion to impurities such as moisture and to the catalytic effects of container surfaces causes its pyrophoricity vngas.com in regards to occupational exposure of silane to workers , the us national institute for occupational safety and health has set a recommended exposure limit of 5 ppm ( 7 & nbsp ; mg/m 3 ) over an eight-hour time-weighted average the possible products include sih 4 and/or higher molecules in the homologous series si n h 2n+2 , a polymeric silicon hydride , or a silicic acid typically , it arises from the reaction of hydrogen chloride with magnesium silicide : : mg 2 si + 4 hcl → 2 mgcl 2 + sih 4 it is also prepared from metallurgical grade silicon in a two-step process the reactions are summarized below : : si + 2 h 2 + 3 sicl 4 → 4 sihcl 3 :2 sihcl 3 → sih 2 cl 2 + sicl 4 :2 dichlorosilane → sihcl 3 + sih 3 cl :2 chlorosilane → sih 4 + sih 2 cl 2 the silane produced by this route can be thermally decomposed to produce high-purity silicon and hydrogen in a single pass in all cases , these substances react with brønsted–lowry acids to produce some type of hydride of silicon that is dependent on the si anion connectivity in the silicide
