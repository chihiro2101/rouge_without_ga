birger , thus most likely born at the time for the battle of gestilren in 1210 and named after his uncle birger brosa , one of the most potent men of the era who died in 1202 , started his career in the mid-1230s by marrying ingeborg eriksdotter , the sister of king eric xi of sweden according to the eric chronicles ( erikskrönikan ) in fierce rivalry with other suitors under any circumstance , he was the son of ingrid ylva , who according to olaus petri was a daughter of sune sik and granddaughter of king sverker i of sweden , which would make birger a matrilineal member of the house of sverker thumb when the papal diplomat william of modena visited present sweden around 1248 , he urged the swedish kings to fulfill the rules of the catholic church , an exhortation which birger seems to have taken as a chance to strengthen his position by simply taking the side of the church against other members of his family ( alternatively it 's possible to interpret this as a manifestation of his pious side ) presumably later that year , birger led an expedition to finland , later dubbed as the second swedish crusade , which permanently established the swedish rule in finland there is a statue of the great duke in his own square birger jarls torg next to riddarholmskyrkan in stockholm , erected by bengt erland fogelberg at the expense of the over-governor of stockholm in 1854 in 1252 , a year after another victory over the folkungs at the battle of herrevadsbro ( slaget vid herrevadsbro ) , birger wrote two carefully dated letters , the first mention of stockholm interpreted as the foundation of the city or at least some sort of special interest in the location while birger 's direct involvement in the foundation of the city remains speculative , it probably was no accident it was founded on the location at this time , as there were alternative passages into mälaren during the preceding viking era ; as crusades , a kind of viking raids in a christian disguise , had proven increasingly unsuccessful ; and as taking control over the location , traditionally where men supposedly gathered before the ledung , meant old offensive military traditions could be replaced by more '' modern '' commercial efforts directed towards lübeck rikissa birgersdotter , born 1238 , married firstly 1251 haakon the young , co-king of norway , and secondly , henry i of werle valdemar birgersson , born c 1238 , king of sweden 1250–1275 , lord of parts of götaland until 1278 christina birgersdotter , married presumably several times , one of her husbands was lord sigge guttormsson magnus birgersson , born 1240 , duke ( of södermanland ) , then king of sweden 1275-90 probably : catherine of sweden , born 1245 , married siegfried , count of anhalt eric birgersson , born 1250 , duke ( of småland ) probably : ingeborg of sweden , born ca as a part of the treaty of lödöse , he also managed to marry off his daughter rikissa , then only 11 years old , to haakon haakonsson the young , the eldest son of king haakon iv of norway this was a choice of historical importance as it was to make birger a jarl powerful enough to ultimately wind up the office , thus making him the last swedish jarl ever , even called as the '' first true king of sweden '' by historians
