a central issue for theories of intentionality has been the problem of intentional inexistence : to determine the ontological status of the entities which are the objects of intentional states phenomenal intentionality theory is commonly contrasted with naturalism about intentionality , the view that intentional properties are reducible to natural properties as studied by the natural sciences intentionalism is entailed by brentano 's claim that intentionality is '' the mark of the mental '' : if all and only mental states are intentional then it is surely the case that all mental states are intentional the effect of these positions is that consciousness is so fully intentional that the mental act has been emptied of all content , and that the idea of pure consciousness is that it is nothing dennett , for example , argues in true believers ( 1981 ) that intentional idiom ( or '' folk psychology '' ) is a predictive strategy and if such a strategy successfully and voluminously predicts the actions of a physical system , then that physical system can be said to have those beliefs attributed to it they are further divided into two theses : adherence to the normative principle adherence to the projective principle advocates of the former , the normative principle , argue that attributions of intentional idioms to physical systems should be the propositional attitudes that the physical system ought to have in those circumstances ( dennett 1987 , 342 ) some anti-intentionalist theories , such as that of ned block , are based on the argument that phenomenal conscious experience or qualia is also a vital component of consciousness , and that it is not intentional those who adhere to the so-called quinean double standard ( namely that ontologically there is nothing intentional , but that the language of intentionality is indispensable ) , accept quine 's thesis of the indeterminacy of translation and its implications , while the other positions so far mentioned do not such a position could be motivated by a form of semantic externalism , the view that the meaning of a term , or in this example the content of a thought , is determined by factors external to the subject the concept of intentionality was reintroduced in 19th-century contemporary philosophy by franz brentano ( a german philosopher and psychology who is generally regarded as the founder of intentionalism ) franz brentano â€“ britannica.com in his work psychology from an empirical standpoint ( 1874 ) an intentional state is transparent if it satisfies the following two conditions : ( i ) it is genuinely relational in that it entails the existence of not just the intender but the intendum as well , and ( ii ) substitutivity of identicals applies to the intendum ( i.e german philosopher martin heidegger ( being and time ) , defined intentionality as '' care '' ( sorge ) , a sentient condition where an individual 's existence , facticity , and being in the world identifies their ontological significance , in contrast to that which is merely ontic ( '' thinghood '' ) others are more skeptical of the human ability to make such an assertion , arguing that the kind of intentionality that emerges from self-organizing networks of automata will always be undecidable because it will never be possible to make our subjective introspective experience of intentionality and decision making coincide with our objective observation of the behavior of a self-organizing machine chisholm 's writings have attempted to summarize the suitable and unsuitable criteria of the concept since the scholastics , arriving at a criterion of intentionality identified by the two aspects of brentano 's thesis and defined by the logical properties that distinguish language describing psychological phenomena from language describing non-psychological phenomena from this thesis the following positions emerge : intentional idiom is problematic for science ; intentional idiom is not problematic for science , which is divided into : eliminative materialism ; epistemological realism ; quinean double standard ( see below ) which is divided into : adherence to normative principle ( epistemology ) , which is divided into : who makes an assumption of rationality ; who follows the principle of charity ; adherence to projective principle but one way to solve the problem is to deny this principle and argue for a kind of intentionality exceptionalism : that intentionality is different from all other relations in the sense that this principle does n't apply to it to bear out further the diversity of sentiment evoked from the notion of intentionality , husserl followed on brentano , and gave the concept of intentionality more widespread attention , both in continental and analytic philosophy as quine puts it , indeterminacy of radical translation is the thesis that '' manuals for translating one language into another can be set up in divergent ways , all compatible with the totality of speech dispositions , yet incompatible with one another '' ( quine 1960 , 27 ) qualia theories , on the other hand , assert that among the phenomenal features of a mental state there are at least some non-intentional phenomenal properties , so-called '' qualia '' , which are not determined by intentional features dennett ( 1969 , 1971 , 1975 ) , cherniak ( 1981 , 1986 ) , and the more recent work of putnam ( 1983 ) recommend the assumption of rationality , which unsurprisingly assumes that the physical system in question is rational another objection is that , by treating intentional objects as mere modifications of intentional states , adverbialism loses the power to distinguish between different complex intentional contents , the so-called many-property-problem one can distinguish in such states their phenomenal features , or what it is like for a subject to have such a state , from their intentional features , or what they are about instead of saying that mary is thinking about superman , it would be more precise , according to adverbialists , to say that mary is thinking in a superman-ly manner or that mary is thinking superman-ly brentano described intentionality as a characteristic of all acts of consciousness that are thus '' psychical '' or '' mental '' phenomena , by which they may be set apart from '' physical '' or '' natural '' phenomena they may argue , for example , that the difference in the last case also belongs to intentional content , because two different properties are ascribed to the apple : seen-roundness and felt-roundness proponents of the eliminative materialism , understand intentional idiom , such as '' belief '' , '' desire '' , and the like , to be replaceable either with behavioristic language ( e.g anscombe ( 1957 ) , peter geach ( 1957 ) , and charles taylor ( 1964 ) all adhere to the former position , namely that intentional idiom is problematic and can not be integrated with the natural sciences stanford encyclopedia of philosophy : intentionality intentionality in ancient philosophy consciousness and intentionality ancient theories of intentionality internet encyclopedia of philosophy : intentionality collective intentionality working on the intentionality of vision , belief , and knowledge , pierre le morvan ( 2005 ) has distinguished between three basic kinds of intentionality that he dubs '' transparent '' , '' translucent '' , and '' opaque '' respectively both pure and impure intentionalism hold that there is a supervenience relation between phenomenal features and intentional features , for example , that two intentional states ca n't differ regarding their phenomenal features without differing at the same time in their intentional features tim crane , himself an impure intentionalist , explains this difference by distinguishing three aspects of intentional states : the intentional object , the intentional content , and the intentional mode forman argues that some of the unusual states of consciousness typical of mystical experience are pure consciousness events in which awareness exists , but has no object , is not awareness '' of '' anything if the intentional state is about a , and a b , then the intentional state is about b as well ) in contrast to brentano 's view , french philosopher jean-paul sartre ( being and nothingness ) identified intentionality with consciousness , stating that the two were indistinguishable dennett comments on this issue , fodor '' attempts to make these irreducible realities acceptable to the physical sciences by grounding them ( somehow ) in the 'syntax ' of a system of physically realized mental representations '' ( dennett 1987 , 345 ) the latter position , which maintains the unity of intentionality with the natural sciences , is further divided into three standpoints : eliminative materialism , supported by w.v the difficulty for such a position is to explain why it seems to mary that she is thinking about something and how seeming to think is different from actual thinking quine ( 1960 ) and churchland ( 1981 ) realism , advocated by jerry fodor ( 1975 ) , as well as burge , dretske , kripke , and the early hilary putnam those who adhere to the quinean double standard
