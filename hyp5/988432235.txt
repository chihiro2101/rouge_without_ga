the landers were identical to that of the previous five venera missions and were to study the atmosphere and surface , each had instruments to study temperature , pressure , a uv spectrometer , a water concentration meter , a gas-phase chromatograph , an x-ray spectrometer , a mass spectrometer , and a surface sampling device they were intended to measure the physical parameters of the nucleus , such as dimensions , shape , temperature , and surface properties , as well as to study the structure and dynamics of the coma , the gas composition close to the nucleus , the dust particles ' composition and mass distribution as functions of distance to the nucleus , and the cometary-solar wind interaction vega mission images from the space research institute ( iki ) raw data from vega 1 and vega 2 on board instruments soviet exploration of venus hsao/nasa astrophysics data system ( ads ) – a tool for studying atmosphere dynamics on venus the balloons were tracked by two networks of 20 radio telescopes in total back on earth : the soviet network , coordinated by the ussr academy of sciences and the international network , coordinated by centre national d'études spatiales of france ( cnes ) the tv data was processed by an international team , including scientists from the soviet union , hungary , france , east germany , and the united states the on-board tv system was created in international cooperation of the scientific and industrial facilities from the ussr , hungary , france , and czechoslovakia at this altitude , pressure and temperature conditions of venus are similar to those of earth , though the planet 's winds moved at hurricane velocity and the carbon dioxide atmosphere is laced with sulphuric acid , along with smaller concentrations of hydrochloric and hydrofluoric acid vega 1 arrived at venus on 11 june 1985 and vega 2 on 15 june 1985 , and each delivered a , diameter spherical descent unit vega 1 made its closest approach on 6 march , around from the nucleus , and vega 2 made its closest approach on 9 march at the craft was powered by twin large solar panels and instruments included an antenna dish , cameras , spectrometer , infrared sounder , magnetometers ( mischa ) , and plasma probes
