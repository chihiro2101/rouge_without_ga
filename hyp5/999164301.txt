geoid the geoid surface is irregular , unlike the reference ellipsoid ( which is a mathematical idealized representation of the physical earth ) , but is considerably smoother than earth 's physical surface although the physical earth has excursions of +8,848 m ( mount everest ) and −11,034 m ( marianas trench ) , the geoid 's deviation from an ellipsoid ranges from +85 & nbsp ; m ( iceland ) to −106 & nbsp ; m ( southern india ) , less than 200 m total in reality , the geoid does not have a physical meaning under the continents , but geodesists are able to derive the heights of continental points above this imaginary , yet physically defined , surface by spirit leveling being an equipotential surface , the geoid is , by definition , a surface to which the force of gravity is everywhere perpendicular that means that when traveling by ship , one does not notice the undulation of the geoid ; the local vertical ( plumb line ) is always perpendicular to the geoid and the local horizon tangential to it that is because gps satellites , orbiting about the center of gravity of the earth , can measure heights only relative to a geocentric reference ellipsoid when height is not zero on a ship , the discrepancy is caused by other factors such as ocean tides , atmospheric pressure ( meteorological effects ) , local sea surface topography and measurement uncertainties an oblate spheroid is typically used as the idealized earth , but even if the earth were spherical and did not rotate , the strength of gravity would not be the same everywhere because density varies throughout the planet instead , the water level would be higher or lower with respect to earth 's center , depending on the strength of gravity in that location in maps and common use the height over the mean sea level ( such as orthometric height ) is used to indicate the height of elevations while the ellipsoidal height results from the gps system and similar gnss the current best such set of spherical harmonic coefficients is egm2020 ( earth gravity model 2020 ) , determined in an international collaborative project led by the national imagery and mapping agency ( now the national geospatial-intelligence agency , or nga ) synthetic calculations show that the geoidal signature of a thickened crust ( for example , in orogen produced by continental collision ) is positive , opposite to what should be expected if the thickening affects the entire lithosphere main nga ( was nima ) page on earth gravity models international geoid service ( iges ) egm96 nasa gsfc earth gravity model earth gravitational model 2008 ( egm2008 , released in july 2008 ) noaa geoid webpage international centre for global earth models ( icgem ) kiamehr 's geoid home page geoid tutorial from li and gotze ( 964kb pdf file ) geoid tutorial at grace website precise geoid determination based on the least-squares modification of stokes ’ formula ( phd thesis pdf )
