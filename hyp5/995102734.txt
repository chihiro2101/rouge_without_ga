during world war ii and the early years of the cold war , the venona project was a source of information on soviet intelligence-gathering directed at the western military powers these included the julius and ethel rosenberg spying case ( which was based on events during world war ii ) and the defections of donald maclean and guy burgess to the soviet union most decipherable messages were transmitted and intercepted between 1942 and 1945 , during world war ii , when the soviet union was an ally of the us sometime in 1945 , the existence of the venona program was revealed to the soviet union by cryptology-analyst bill weisband , an nkvd agent in the u.s this effort continued ( many times at a low level of effort in the latter years ) through 1980 , when the venona program was terminated while a number of academics and historians assert that most of the individuals mentioned in the venona decrypts were most likely either clandestine assets and/or contacts of soviet intelligence agents , how venona was declassified , robert louis benson , symposium of cryptologic history ; october 27 , 2005 the venona project was initiated on february 1 , 1943 , by gene grabeel , an american mathematician and cryptanalyst , under orders from colonel carter w clarke distrusted joseph stalin , and feared that the soviet union would sign a separate peace with nazi germany , allowing germany to focus its military forces against the united kingdom and the united states army 's signal intelligence service at arlington hall analyzed encrypted high-level soviet diplomatic intelligence messages intercepted in large volumes during and immediately after world war ii by american , british , and australian listening posts the soviet systems in general used a code to convert words and letters into numbers , to which additive keys ( from one-time pads ) were added , encrypting the content however , cryptanalysis by american code-breakers revealed that some of the one-time pad material had incorrectly been reused by the soviets ( specifically , entire pages , although not complete books ) , which allowed decryption ( sometimes only partial ) of a small part of the traffic hallock and his colleagues , amongst whom were genevieve feinstein , cecil phillips , frank lewis , frank wanat , and lucille campbell , went on to break into a significant amount of trade traffic , recovering many one-time pad additive key tables in the process claims have been made that information from the physical recovery of code books ( a partially burned one was obtained by the finns ) to bugging embassy rooms in which text was entered into encrypting devices ( analyzing the keystrokes by listening to them being punched in ) contributed to recovering much of the plaintext one significant aid ( mentioned by the nsa ) in the early stages may have been work done in cooperation between the japanese and finland cryptanalysis organizations ; when the americans broke into japanese codes during world war ii , they gained access to this information approximately 2,200 messages were decrypted and translated ; about half of the 1943 gru-naval washington to moscow messages were broken , but none for any other year , although several thousand were sent between 1941 and 1945 the decryption rate of the nkvd cables was as follows : 1942 1.8 % 1943 15.0 % 1944 49.0 % 1945 1.5 % out of some hundreds of thousands of intercepted encrypted texts , it is claimed under 3,000 have been partially or wholly decrypted the us army security agency , in the person of meredith knox gardner , a genius in his own right , had broken one of what it termed the venona messages—the transmissions that soviet agents in the united states sent to and received from moscow others worked in washington in the state department , the treasury , office of strategic services , '' kgb cables indicated that the office of strategic services ( oss ) in world war ii had been thoroughly infiltrated with soviet agents among those identified are julius and ethel rosenberg ; alger hiss ; harry dexter white , the second-highest official in the treasury department ; lauchlin currie , '' currie , known as pazh ( page ) and white , whose cover names were yurist ( jurist ) and changed later to lajer ( lawyer ) , had been soviet agents since the 1930s the war production board , the board of economic warfare , the office of the coordinator of inter-american affairs and the office of war information , included at least half a dozen soviet sources each among their employees moreover , oleg gordievsky , a high-level kgb officer who also defected from the soviet union , reported that iskhak akhmerov , the kgb officer who controlled the clandestine soviet agents in the u.s venona has added significant information to the case of julius and ethel rosenberg , making it clear julius was guilty of espionage , and also showing that ethel , while not acting as a principal , still acted as an accessory , who took part in julius 's espionage activity and played a role in the recruitment of her brother for atomic espionage venona and other recent information has shown , while the content of julius ' atomic espionage was not as vital to the soviets as alleged at the time of his espionage activities , in other fields it was extensive some of the earliest messages decrypted concerned information from a scientist at the manhattan project , who was referred to by the code names of charles and rest according to the moynihan commission on government secrecy , the complicity of both alger hiss and harry dexter white is conclusively proven by venona , '' report of the commission on protecting and reducing government secrecy '' stating '' the complicity of alger hiss of the state department seems settled '' in his 1998 book , united states senator daniel patrick moynihan expressed certainty about hiss 's identification by venona as a soviet spy , writing '' hiss was indeed a soviet agent and appears to have been regarded by moscow as its most important as well as australian diplomat suspects abroad , venona had revealed walter seddon clayton ( cryptonym '' klod '' ) , a leading official within the communist party of australia ( cpa ) , as the chief organiser of soviet intelligence gathering in australia in 1950 , george ronald richards was appointed asio 's deputy-director of operations for venona , based in sydney , charged with investigating intelligence uncovered the eleven australians identified in the cables that were decoded senior army officers , in consultation with the fbi and cia , made the decision to restrict knowledge of venona within the government ( even the cia was not made an active partner until 1952 ) some of the earliest detailed public knowledge that soviet code messages from world war ii had been broken came with the release of chapman pincher 's book , too secret too long , in 1984 however , the first detailed account of the venona project , identifying it by name and making clear its long-term implications in post-war espionage , was contained in mi5 assistant director peter wright 's 1987 memoir , spycatcher many inside the nsa had argued internally that the time had come to publicly release the details of the venona project , but it was not until 1995 that the bipartisan commission on government secrecy , with senator moynihan as chairman , released venona project materials the dearth of reliable information available to the public—or even to the president and congress—may have helped to polarize debates of the 1950s over the extent and danger of soviet espionage in the united states writers walter and miriam schneir , in a lengthy 1999 review of one of the first book-length studies of the messages , object to what they see as the book 's overconfidence in the translations ' accuracy , noting that the undecrypted gaps in the texts can make interpretation difficult , and emphasizing the problem of identifying the individuals mentioned under covernames '' lowenthal 's article led to an extended debate on the 'ales ' message , the first response to lowenthal was following this there was an extended discussion on h-net diplo list and the h-net list for the history of american communism for a summary of a draft response from lowenthal ( he died in 2003 ) see another response following this was this gave rise to a conference paper : ( archived version ) and finally a response from mark again ( he died in 2009 ) : and even prompted the nsa to declassify the original russian text '' commenting on the list of 349 americans identified by venona , published in an appendix to venona : decoding soviet espionage in america , navasky wrote , '' the reader is left with the implication—unfair and unproven—that every name on the list was involved in espionage , and as a result , otherwise careful historians and mainstream journalists now routinely refer to venona as proof that many hundreds of americans were part of the red spy network '' navasky goes further in his defense of the listed people and has claimed a great deal of the so-called espionage that went on was nothing more than '' exchanges of information among people of good will '' and that '' most of these exchanges were innocent and were within the law '' according to historian ellen schrecker , '' because they offer insights into the world of the secret police on both sides of the iron curtain , it is tempting to treat the fbi and venona materials less critically than documents from more accessible sources '' schrecker believes the documents established the guilt of many prominent figures , but is still critical of the views of scholars such as john earl haynes , arguing , '' complexity , nuance , and a willingness to see the world in other than black and white seem alien to haynes ' view of history elizabeth bentley history of soviet and russian espionage in the united
