texaco star theater ( spelled theatre for most of the radio show 's run ) was first broadcast on october 5 , 1938 , and it continued on the air until june 26 , 1940 in 1940 , the show became a star vehicle for allen , with the show re-titled texaco star theater with fred allen and the program airing on october 2 , 1940 allen 's previous sponsor , bristol-myers ' ipana toothpaste and sal hepatica laxative , decided to cease their tandem sponsorship of allen 's successful hour , first known as town hall tonight and then , for its final season , the fred allen show he presided over texaco star theater from 1940 to 1942 as an hour-long show on wednesday and then sunday nights , and from 1942 to 1944 as a half-hour show , until he withdrew from work for over a year on his doctor 's advice though some believe the title texaco star theater was retired temporarily , in favor of texaco time , after allen scaled the show back to a half-hour , the show retained the texaco star theater title officially , the confusion likely stemming from the announcers ' first words of introduction : '' it 's texaco time starring fred allen when the television version launched on june 8 , 1948 , texaco also made sure its employees were featured prominently throughout the hour , usually appearing as smiling '' guardian angels '' performing good deeds of one or another kind , and a quartet of texaco singers opened each week 's show with the theme song they did not settle on berle—who hosted a freshly revived radio version in spring 1948—as the permanent host right away ; he hosted the first television texaco star theater in june 1948 but was originally part of a rotation of hosts ( berle himself had only a four-week contract ) and , as the show landed a pair of emmy awards in that first year ( the show itself , for best kinescope show ; and , berle as most outstanding kinescoped personality ) , uncle miltie ( he first called himself by that name ad-libbing at the end of a 1949 broadcast ) joked , preened , pratfell , danced , costumed , and clowned his way to stardom , with americans discovering television as a technological marvel and entertainment medium seeming to bring the country to a dead stop every tuesday night , just to see what the madcap berle might pull next with berle at the helm , texaco star theater was largely credited with driving american television set sales heavily ; the number of tv sets sold during berle 's run on the show was said to have grown from 500,000 , his first year on the tube , to over 30 & nbsp ; million when the show ended in 1956 by then , berle and his audience had probably burned out on each other , and buick had even dropped sponsorship of the show at the beginning of the 1955–1956 season ( opting to sponsor jackie gleason 's half-hour filmed edition of the honeymooners ) , after ratings fell dramatically during the 1954–1955 as well ( the higher ratings of his 1955–56 competition , the phil silvers show on cbs , did not help berle either ) ; though berle would remain one of the nation 's beloved entertainers , overall , the show that made him a superstar was clearly spent for steam and fresh ideas , and two subsequent attempts at television comebacks hosting his own show lasted barely a year each ) part of the problem was variety shows becoming costlier to produce , compared to the texaco days when , among other factors , name guest stars did not mind the low appearance fees they got for appearing , because they could bank the exposure they got from even one appearance on the berle show ; or with fred allen and ed wynn in its earlier radio incarnations
