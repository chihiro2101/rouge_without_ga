beta-barrel proteins are so far found only in outer membranes of gram-negative bacteria , cell walls of gram-positive bacteria , outer membranes of mitochondria and chloroplasts , or can be secreted as pore-forming toxins type i transmembrane proteins are anchored to the lipid membrane with a stop-transfer anchor sequence and have their n-terminal domains targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) lumen during synthesis ( and the extracellular space , if mature forms are located on cell membranes ) ; molecular cell biology , sixth edition , p.546 the implications for the division in the four types are especially manifest at the time of translocation and er-bound translation , when the protein has to be passed through the er membrane in a direction dependent on the type the portion of the membrane proteins that are attached to the lipid bilayer ( see annular lipid shell ) consist mostly of hydrophobic amino acids membrane proteins of known 3d structure due to this difficulty and the importance of this class of proteins methods of protein structure prediction based on hydropathy plots , the positive inside rule and other methods have been developed transmembrane helix proteins are unusually stable judging from thermal denaturation studies , because they do not unfold completely within the membranes ( the complete unfolding would require breaking down too many α-helical h-bonds in the nonpolar media ) on the other hand , these proteins easily misfold , due to non-native aggregation in membranes , transition to the molten globule states , formation of non-native disulfide bonds , or unfolding of peripheral regions and nonregular loops that are locally less stable for example , the '' unfolded '' bacteriorhodopsin in sds micelles has four transmembrane α-helices folded , while the rest of the protein is situated at the micelle-water interface and can adopt different types of non-native amphiphilic structures they include : ompa-like transmembrane domain ( ompa ) virulence-related outer membrane protein family ( ompx ) outer membrane protein w family ( ompw ) antimicrobial peptide resistance and lipid a acylation protein family ( pagp ) lipid a deacylase pagl opacity family porins ( nspa ) autotransporter domain ( n 12 , s 14 ) fadl outer membrane protein transport family , including fatty acid transporter fadl ( n 14 , s 14 ) general bacterial porin family , known as trimeric porins ( n 16 , s 20 ) maltoporin , or sugar porins ( n 18 , s 22 ) nucleoside-specific porin ( n 12 , s 16 ) outer membrane phospholipase a1 ( n 12 , s 16 ) tonb-dependent receptors and their plug domain they are ligand-gated outer membrane channels ( n 22 , s 24 ) , including cobalamin transporter btub , fe ( iii ) -pyochelin receptor fpta , receptor fepa , ferric hydroxamate uptake receptor fhua , transporter feca , and pyoverdine receptor fpva outer membrane protein opca family ( n 10 , s 12 ) that includes outer membrane protease ompt and outer membrane protein opca outer membrane protein g porin family ( n 14 , s 16 ) note : n and s are , respectively , the number of beta-strands and the '' shear number '' of the beta-barrel trimeric autotransporter ( n 12 , s 12 ) outer membrane efflux proteins , also known as trimeric outer membrane factors ( n 12 , s 18 ) including tolc and multidrug resistance proteins mspa porin ( octamer , n s 16 ) and α-hemolysin ( heptamer n s 14 )
