'' the endochronic properties of resublimated thiotimoline '' and '' the micropsychiatric applications of thiotimoline '' on the internet archive the first two thiotimoline '' articles '' appeared together in asimov 's first collection of science essays , only a trillion ( 1957 ) , under the joint title '' the marvellous properties of thiotimoline '' he feared that the experience of writing readable prose for publication might have impaired his ability to write the turgid prose typical of academic discourse , and decided to practice with a spoof article ( including charts , graphs , tables , and citations of fake articles in nonexistent journals ) describing experiments on a compound , thiotimoline , that was so soluble that it dissolved in water up to 1.12 seconds before the water was added in 1952 , asimov wrote a second spoof scientific paper on thiotimoline called '' the micropsychiatric applications of thiotimoline '' '' thiotimoline and the space age '' appeared in the october 1960 issue of astounding , which was then in the final stages of changing its name to analog in his address , asimov '' describes '' his first experiments with thiotimoline in july 1947 , and timing the compound 's dissolution with the original endochronometer , '' the same instrument now at the smithsonian '' instead of a fake scientific paper , this third article took the form of an address by asimov to the 12th annual meeting of the american chronochemical society , a nonexistent scientific society in asimov 's writings the endochronicity of thiotimoline is explained by the fact that in the thiotimoline molecule , there is at least one carbon atom such that , while two of the carbon 's four chemical bonds lie in normal spacetime , one of the bonds projects into the future and another into the past vernon 's speech explains that thiotimoline was first mentioned in 1948 by a semi-mythical scientist named azimuth or asymptote , but that serious study of the compound did n't begin until the 21st century scientist almirante worked out the theory of steric hindrance a research note can be found in one location which makes reference to '' thiomotilene crystals '' and their '' endochronic properties '' , which in turn strongly suggests motilene 's name be derived from thiotimoline asimov 's final piece on thiotimoline was a short story titled '' thiotimoline to the stars '' , which he wrote for harry harrison 's astounding ( 1973 ) the last byte in the game we happy few , a mysterious liquid called '' motilene '' acts as the primary source of electrical power in the setting , and is pumped throughout the city in pipes in lieu of a traditional electrical grid , or alternatively placed into special jars to act as portable batteries like the first , it included charts , graphs , tables , and citations of fake articles from fake journals ( along with one real citation : asimov 's own earlier spoof article from astounding , which was listed tongue-in-cheek as the journal of astounding science fiction ) in glen bever 's story '' and silently vanish away '' a chemist with the unique ability to use psychokinetic catalysis to speed up difficult reactions is shocked by a lab explosion and the mixture he was working on gets changed campbell , the editor of astounding science fiction accepted it for publication on 10 june , agreeing to asimov 's request that it appear under a pseudonym in deference to asimov 's concern that he might alienate potential doctoral examiners at columbia university if he were revealed as the author
