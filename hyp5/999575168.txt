robert palmer pointed to electric blues guitarists willie johnson and pat hare , both of whom played for sun records in the early 1950s , as the true originators of the power chord , citing as evidence johnson 's playing on howlin ' wolf 's '' how many more years '' ( recorded 1951 ) and hare 's playing on james cotton 's '' cotton crop blues '' ( recorded 1954 ) however , the term is accepted as a pop and rock music term , most strongly associated with the overdriven electric guitar styles of hard rock , heavy metal , punk rock , and similar genres they can also be played with octave doublings of the root or fifth note , which makes a sound that is subjectively higher pitched with less power in the low frequencies , but still retains the character of a power chord '' when a typical chord containing such intervals ( for example , a major or minor chord ) is played through distortion , the number of different frequencies generated , and the complex ratios between them , can make the resulting sound messy and indistinct '' distortion â€“ the physics of heavy metal '' , bbc this effect is accentuated as most guitars are tuned based on equal temperament , with the result that minor thirds are narrower , and major thirds wider , than they would be in just intonation the intermodulation makes the spectrum of the sound expand in both directions , and with enough distortion , a new fundamental frequency component appears an octave lower than the root note of the chord played without distortion , giving a richer , more bassy and more subjectively 'powerful ' sound than the undistorted signal when two or more notes are played through a distortion process that nonlinearity transforms the audio signal , additional partials are generated at the sums and differences of the frequencies of the harmonics of those notes ( intermodulation distortion ) perhaps the most common implementation is 1-5-1 ' , that is , the root note , a note a fifth above the root , and a note an octave above the root when the strings are a fourth apart , especially the lower four strings in guitar tuning , the lowest note is played with some fret on some string and the higher two notes are two frets higher on the next two strings the first written instance of a power chord for guitar in the twentieth century is to be found in the '' preludes '' of heitor villa-lobos , brazilian composer of the early twentieth century for example , '' c5 '' or '' c ( no 3 ) '' refer to playing the root ( c ) and fifth ( g ) thumb theorists are divided on whether a power chord can be considered a chord in the traditional sense , with some requiring a 'chord ' to contain a minimum of three degrees of the scale even when played without distortion , the simple ratios between the harmonics in the notes of a power chord can give a stark and powerful sound , owing to the resultant tone ( combination tone ) effect ) when the strings are a fourth apart , the lower two notes are played with some fret on some two strings and the highest note is two frets higher on the next string
