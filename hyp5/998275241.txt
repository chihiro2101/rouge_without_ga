thus spoke zarathustra , the ideas of which first came to nietzsche while walking on two roads surrounding rapallo , was conceived while writing the gay science according to elisabeth förster-nietzsche in the introduction of thomas common 's early translation of the book , nietzsche wrote that the ideas for zarathustra first came to him while walking on two roads surrounding rapallo more specifically , the concept of the eternal return , which is the central idea of zarathustra by nietzsche 's admission , first occurred to nietzsche in switzerland : he was inspired by the sight of a gigantic , towering , pyramidal rock—a '' pyramidal block of stone '' —while walking through the woods along the shores of lake silvaplana , in the engadin , a high alpine region whose valley floor is at although part three was originally planned to be the end of the book , ending with a strong climax , nietzsche subsequently decided to write an additional three parts ; ultimately , however , he composed only the fourth part , which is viewed to constitute an intermezzo nietzsche commented in ecce homo that for the completion of each part , '' ten days sufficed ; in no case , neither for the first nor for the third and last , did i require more the first three parts were first published separately , and were subsequently published in a single volume in 1887 for instance , words beginning with über ( 'over , above ' ) and ( 'down , below ' ) are often paired to emphasise the contrast , which is not always possible to bring out in translation , except by coinages 'down-going ' ) , which is used in german to mean 'setting ' ( as in , of the sun ) , but also 'sinking ' , 'demise ' , 'downfall ' , or 'doom ' he goes on to characterize '' what the name of zarathustra means in my mouth , the mouth of the first immoralist : '' zarathustra has a simple characterisation and plot , pippin , robert likewise , the separate dionysian-dithyrambs was written in autumn 1888 , and printed with the full volume in 1892 , as the corollaries of zarathustra 's '' abundance zarathustra also contains the famous dictum '' god is dead , '' which had appeared earlier in the gay science emphasizing its centrality and its status as his masterpiece , nietzsche has stated that : since many of the book 's ideas are also present in his other works , zarathustra is seen to have served as a precursor to his later philosophical thought a singular feature of zarathustra , first presented in the prologue , is the designation of human beings as a transition between apes and the übermensch ( 'overman , superman ' ; or 'overhuman , superhuman ' ) the overman ( übermensch ) , a self-mastered individual who has achieved his full power , is a nearly omnipresent concept in the book , whereby humankind is merely a bridge between animals and the overman it is one of the many interconnecting , interdependent themes of the story , and is represented through several different metaphor , including , for example : the lightning that is portended by the silence and raindrops of a travelling storm cloud ; the sun 's rise and culmination at its midday zenith ; and a man traversing a rope stationed above an abyss , moving away from his uncultivated animality and towards the übermensch the symbol of the übermensch alludes to nietzsche 's notions of '' self-mastery , '' '' self-cultivation , '' '' self-direction , '' and '' self-overcoming in his autobiographical ecce homo , nietzsche states that the book 's underlying concept is discussed within '' the penultimate section of the fourth book '' of the gay science : the eternal recurrence of the same events contrasted with living for procreation , pleasure , or happiness , the will to power is the summary of all man 's struggle against his surrounding environment as well as his reason for living in it this empiricism view ( denial of afterlife ) is not fully examined in a rational argument in the text , but taken as a simple fact in nietzsche 's aphorism writing style noteworthy for its format , the book comprises a philosophical work of fiction whose style often lightheartedly imitates that of the new testament and of the platonic dialogues , at times resembling pre-socratic works in tone and in its use of natural phenomena as rhetorical and explanatory devices nietzsche achieves all of this through the character of zoroaster ( referring to the traditional prophet of zoroastrianism ) , who makes speeches on philosophic topics as he moves along a loose plotline marking his development and the reception of his ideas moreover , it offers formulations of eternal recurrence , and nietzsche for the first time speaks of the übermensch : themes that would dominate his books from this point onwards the style of the book , along with its ambiguity and paradox nature , has helped its eventual enthusiastic reception by the reading public , but has frustrated academic attempts at analysis ( as nietzsche may have intended ) thus spoke zarathustra remained unpopular as a topic for scholars ( especially those in the anglo-american analytic tradition ) until the latter half of the 20th century brought widespread interest in nietzsche and his unconventional style the critic harold bloom criticized thus spoke zarathustra in the western canon ( 1994 ) , calling the book '' a gorgeous disaster '' and '' unreadable kaufmann 's introduction to his own translation included a blistering critique of common 's version ; he notes that in one instance , common has taken the german '' most evil '' and rendered it '' baddest '' , a particularly unfortunate error not merely for his having coined the term '' baddest '' , but also because nietzsche dedicated a third of the genealogy of morals to the difference between '' bad '' and '' evil 1895–1896 : '' zarathustra 's roundelay '' is set as part of gustav mahler 's third symphony , originally under the title what man tells me , or alternatively what the night tells me ( of man ) 1896 : the book inspired richard strauss to compose the tone poem also sprach zarathustra , which he designated '' freely based on friedrich nietzsche the work ends with a setting of '' zarathustra 's roundelay '' which delius had composed earlier , in 1898 , as a separate work 1944 : the short score of the third symphony by arnold bax originally began with a quotation from thus spoke zarathustra : '' my wisdom became pregnant on lonely mountains ;
