other proposed mechanisms include the interactions of inflammation , particularly cytokines , which are released during a fever , causing elevated temperatures in the brain , which may somehow lead to a seizure diagnosis involves gathering a detailed history including the value of highest temperature recorded , timing of seizure and fever , seizure characteristics , time to return to baseline , vaccination history , illness exposures , family history , etc however , lumbar puncture is an option that may be considered in children younger than 12 months of age since signs and symptoms of meningitis may be atypical , if the child does not return to baseline , or if the child lacks immunization against haemophilus influenzae and pneumococcal or vaccination status is unknown seek immediate medical attention if this is the child 's first febrile seizure and take the child to the doctor once the seizure has ended to check for the cause of the fever in those with a single seizure lasting greater than 5 minutes or two consecutive seizures lasting greater than 5 minutes in which the person has not returned to their baseline mental status , defined as status epilepticus , intravenous lorazepam , rectal diazepam , or intranasal midazolam is recommended questions that may be asked of the caregivers who witnessed the seizure include , length of seizure , timing of day , loss of consciousness , loss of bowel or urinary continence , a period of altered level of consciousness of confusion once the seizure stopped , movement of the eyes to a specific side , recent infections , recent medication usage including antibiotics or fever reducer medications , family history of febrile and afebrile seizures , vaccination and travel history evaluation for the cause of fever should be performed including signs of an infection such as a bulging tympanic membrane ( otitis media ) , red pharynx , enlarged tonsils , enlarged cervical lymph nodes ( streptococcal pharyngitis or infectious mononucleosis ) , and a widespread rash those who have one febrile seizure have an approximately 30- 40 % chance of having another one in the next two years , with the risk being greater in those who are younger children with febrile convulsions are more likely to have a febrile seizure in the future if they were young at their first seizure ( less than 18 months old ) , have a family history of a febrile convulsions in first-degree relatives ( a parent or sibling ) , have a short time between the onset of fever and the seizure , had a low degree of fever before their seizure , or have a seizure history of abnormal neurological signs or developmental delay similarly , the prognosis after a complex febrile seizure is excellent , although an increased risk of death has been shown for complex febrile seizures , partly related to underlying conditions
