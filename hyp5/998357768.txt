this led to lawson 's resignation as chancellor ; he was replaced by former treasury chief secretary john major who , with douglas hurd , the then foreign secretary , convinced the cabinet to sign britain up to the erm in october 1990 , effectively guaranteeing that the british government would follow an economic and monetary policy preventing the exchange rate between the pound and other member currencies from fluctuating by more than 6 % in 1989 , the uk had inflation three times the rate of germany , higher interest rates at 15 % , and much lower labour productivity than france and germany , which indicated the uk 's different economic state in comparison to other erm countries issues of national prestige and the commitment to a doctrine that the fixing of exchange rates within the erm was a pathway to a single european currency inhibited the adjustment of exchange rates in the wake of the rejection of the maastricht treaty by the danish electorate in a referendum in the spring of 1992 , and an announcement that there would be a referendum in france as well , those erm currencies that were trading close to the bottom of their erm bands came under pressure from foreign exchange traders in the months leading up to black wednesday , among many other currency traders , george soros had been building a huge short position in pounds sterling that would become immensely profitable if the pound fell below the lower band of the erm soros believed the rate at which the united kingdom was brought into the exchange rate mechanism was too high , inflation was too high ( triple the german rate ) , and british interest rates were hurting their asset prices when the markets opened in london the next morning , the bank of england began their attempt to prop up their currency , as decided by norman lamont ( chancellor of the exchequer ) and robin leigh-pemberton ( governor of the bank of england ) at 10:30 am on 16 september , the british government announced an increase in the base interest rate , from an already high 10 % , to 12 % to tempt speculators to buy pounds by 7:00 that evening , lamont announced britain would leave the erm and rates would remain at the new level of 12 % ; however , on the next day the interest rate was back to 10 % it was later revealed that the decision to withdraw had been agreed at an emergency meeting during the day between lamont , major , foreign secretary douglas hurd , president of the board of trade michael heseltine , and home secretary kenneth clarke ( the latter three all being staunch pro-europeans as well as senior cabinet ministers ) , major 's dither cost uk billions , says lamont while many people in the uk recall black wednesday as a national disaster that permanently affected the country 's international prestige , some conservatives claim that the forced ejection from the erm was a '' golden wednesday '' or '' white wednesday '' , the day that paved the way for an economic revival , with the conservatives handing tony blair 's new labour a much stronger economy in 1997 than had existed in 1992 as the new economic policy swiftly devised in the aftermath of black wednesday led to re-establishment of economic growth with falling unemployment and inflation the conservative party ( uk ) 's reputation for economic excellence had been damaged to the extent that the electorate was more inclined to support a claim of the opposition of the time â€“ that the economic recovery ought to be credited to external factors , as opposed to government policies implemented by the conservatives black wednesday was a major factor in the conservatives finally losing the 1997 general election to labour , who won by a landslide under the leadership of tony blair
