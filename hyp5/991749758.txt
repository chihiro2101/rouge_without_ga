the term '' molecular chaperone '' appeared first in the literature in 1978 , and was invented by ron laskey to describe the ability of a nuclear protein called nucleoplasmin to prevent the aggregation of folded histone proteins with dna during the assembly of nucleosomes new functions for chaperones continue to be discovered , such as bacterial adhesin activity , induction of aggregation towards non-amyloid aggregates , suppression of toxic protein oligomers via their clustering , and in responding to diseases linked to protein aggregation ( e.g the reason for this behaviour is that protein folding is severely affected by heat and , therefore , some chaperones act to prevent or correct damage caused by misfolding synthesis of the long tail fibers depends on the chaperone protein gp57a that is needed for the trimerization of gp34 and gp37 , the major structural proteins of the tail fibers some of these hsp100 chaperones , like clpa and clpx , associate with the double-ringed tetradecameric serine protease clpp ; instead of catalyzing the refolding of client proteins , these complexes are responsible for the targeted destruction of tagged and misfolded proteins gp4 ( 50 ) ( 65 ) , although not specifically listed as a chaperone , acts catalytically as a nuclease that appears to be essential for morphogenesis by cleaving packaged dna to enable the joining of heads to tails although a precise mechanistic understanding has yet to be determined , it is known that hsp70s have a high-affinity bound state to unfolded proteins when bound to adp , and a low-affinity state when bound to atp it is thought that many hsp70s crowd around an unfolded substrate , stabilizing it and preventing aggregation until the unfolded molecule folds properly , at which time the hsp70s lose affinity for the molecule and diffuse away these gps were gp26 , gp31 , gp38 , gp51 , gp28 , and gp4 gene 4 is synonomous with genes 50 and 65 , and thus the gp can be designated gp4 ( 50 ) ( 65 ) many chaperones are heat shock proteins , that is , proteins expressed in response to elevated temperatures or other cellular stresses coli , many of these proteins are highly expressed under conditions of high stress , for example , when the bacterium is placed in high temperatures some chaperone systems work as foldase : they support the folding of proteins in an atp-dependent manner ( for example , the groel/groes or the dnak/dnaj/grpe system ) these proteins are thought to function as chaperones by processively threading client proteins through a small 20 Ã¥ ( 2 nm ) pore , thereby giving each client protein a second chance to fold some chaperones can assist in protein degradation , leading proteins to protease systems , such as the ubiquitin-proteasome system in eukaryotes heat shock protein 90 ( hsp90 ) is a molecular chaperone essential for activating many signaling proteins in the eukaryotic cell lectin chaperones : calnexin and calreticulin non-classical molecular chaperones : hsp47 and erp29 folding chaperones : protein disulfide isomerase ( pdi ) , peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase ( ppi ) , prolyl isomerase soluble complexes of target proteins and peptidyl prolyl isomerase chaperonins are characterized by a stacked double-ring structure and are found in prokaryotes , in the cytosol of eukaryotes , and in mitochondria 1998 ; 63 ( 4 ) :399-406 chaperone gp40 participates in the assembly of gp20 , thus aiding in the formation of the connector complex that initiates head procapsid assembly more information on the various types and mechanisms of a subset of chaperones that encapsulate their folding substrates ( e.g
