ibanez fixed edge , while it still uses the locking nut and locking bridge , was mounted on top of the body , and was used not as a vibrato system , but to provide a familiar feel to vibrato users , and even more tuning stability on a hardtailed guitar while fender used floyd rose-licensed vibrato systems previously , this move allowed fender to offer a few models with the original floyd rose tremolo , such as the richie sambora in 1991 , the floyd rose classic stratocaster in 1992 and the set-neck floyd rose strat in 1993 it is the balance between string-tension and spring-tension , as well as the fact that the strings end at the bridge saddles and nut ( eliminating '' play '' in the string , which would negatively affect tuning ) , that brings the strings reliably back into tune when force on the bar is removed floyd rose speedloader is a redesign developed in 1995–1999 and introduced around 2003 that combines floyd rose original with the speedloader system , and requires special strings and is manufactured under license of mccabe us patents for '' macrotuners '' , ie in this set-up , a broken string has no effect on the pitch of the other strings , as the reduced overall string tension from the broken string does n't make the bridge move , since it already presses against the body of the guitar the floyd rose 1000 is built with the same materials as the original , however the floyd rose special utilizes substitute materials such as zinc alloy saddles instead of steel and a zinc alloy sustain block instead of brass which significantly decreases the cost of the special model other players frequently cited as influential floyd rose users are steve vai , joe satriani , kirk hammett , brad gillis , tom morello , allan holdsworth , dimebag darrell reinventing the squeal and synyster gates floyd rose collaborated with fender to design a fender deluxe locking tremolo , introduced in 1991 on the strat plus , the usa contemporary stratocaster , and the strat ultra however , if a string breaks , the balance of tensions on the bridge is disrupted , leaving the bridge out of position and therefore the guitar out of tune note that when using the vibrato bar , string action ( the distance between the strings and the fretboard ) is affected , and this can sometimes cause the strings to unintentionally touch the frets and create unwanted sounds on instruments set up with extremely low action and heavily recessed vibrato installations because the bridges and nuts were no longer hand-made it was necessary to update the design , and the bridges were changed to add a set of tuners that allow for fine-tuning the guitar after the strings are locked at the nut , forcing the vibrato bar all the way down to the guitar body , or pulling up on the bar to raise the tone by as much as a fifth or a seventh a specially designed system that was made by fender musical instruments corporation in 1991 in conjunction with floyd rose , utilizing locking tuners , a modified fender 2-point synchronized vibrato with locking bridge saddles and a special low-friction lsr roller nut that lets strings slide during vibrato use ibanez zr uses a ball-bearing mechanic instead of knife-edge as the joint , and a stop-bar to help the guitar stay in tune after diving the vibrato this means the cavity of the tremolo pocket is not fully milled away underneath—and if the tension of the rear springs is slightly stronger than the tension of the strings , the tremolo always rests flush with the body note that the name '' floyd rose original '' is used to differentiate this system from '' floyd rose licensed '' kramer 's guitar models with the floyd rose bridge became very popular , leading them to drop the earlier rockinger vibrato in favor of the floyd rose between june 1982 and january 1983
