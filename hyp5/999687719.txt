noah webster ( 1758–1843 ) , the author of the readers and spelling books which dominated the american market at the time , spent decades of research in compiling his dictionaries '' the effects of the revolution on language '' , in a companion to the american revolution in 1828 , when noah webster was 70 , his american dictionary of the english language was published by s again in two volumes ,

concerns including the politics of american english , the question of national identity and culture in the early moments of american independence , and the poetics of citation and of definition austin , '' lost in the maze of words : reading and re-reading noah webster 's dictionaries , '' dissertation abstracts international , 2005 , vol goodrich , published an abridgment of noah webster 's 1828 american dictionary of the english language in 1829 , with the same number of words and webster 's full definitions , but with truncated literary references and expanded etymology upon webster 's death in 1843 , the unsold books and all rights to the copyright and name '' webster '' were purchased by brothers george and charles merriam , who then hired webster 's son-in-law chauncey a in 1850 , blackie and son in glasgow published the first general dictionary of english that made heavy use of pictorial illustrations integrated with the text , the imperial dictionary , english ,

dictionary of 1860 , a dictionary of the english language , the g porter also edited the succeeding edition , webster ’ s international dictionary of the english language ( 1890 ) , which was an expansion of the american dictionary in 1934 , the new international dictionary was revised and expanded for a second edition , which is popularly known as webster ’ s second or w2 , although it was not published under that title 1977 ) – a trademark dispute in which the terms '' lite '' and '' light '' were held to be generic for light beer and therefore available for use by anyone – the u.s court of appeals for the seventh circuit , after considering a definition from webster ’ s third new international dictionary , wrote that '' the comparable definition in the previous , and for many the classic , edition of the same dictionary is as follows : merriam issued the entirely new webster 's third new international dictionary of the english language , unabridged ( commonly known as webster 's third , or w3 ) in september 1961 123 the dictionary 's treatment of '' ai n't '' was subject to particular scorn , since it seemed to overrule the near-unanimous denunciation of that word by english teachers a cd-rom version of the complete text , with thousands of additional new words and definitions from the '' addenda '' , was published by merriam-webster in 2000 , and is often packaged with the print edition with the ninth edition ( webster 's ninth new collegiate dictionary ( wnncd ) , published in 1983 ) , the collegiate adopted changes which distinguish it as a separate entity rather than merely an abridgment of the third new international ( the main text of which has remained virtually unrevised since 1961 ) this dictionary is preferred as a source '' for general matters of spelling '' by the chicago manual of style , which is followed by many book publishers and magazines in the united states one such revision was webster 's imperial dictionary , based on john ogilvie 's the imperial dictionary of the english language , itself an expansion of noah webster 's american dictionary 638 ( 1908 ) in 1917 , a us court ruled that webster 's entered the public domain in 1834 when noah webster 's 1806 dictionary 's copyright lapsed although merriam-webster revisers find solid ground in noah webster 's concept of the english language as an ever-changing tapestry , the issue is more complicated than that further revisions by merriam-webster came to have little in common with their original source , while the universal , for example , was minimally revised and remained largely out of date random house dictionaries are now called random house webster 's , and microsoft 's encarta world english dictionary is now encarta webster 's dictionary the dictionary now called webster 's new universal no longer even uses the text of the original webster 's new universal dictionary , but rather is a newly commissioned version of the random house dictionary noah webster 's main competitor was a man named joseph emerson worcester , whose 1830 comprehensive pronouncing and explanatory dictionary of the english language brought accusations of plagiarism from webster the rivalry was carried on by merriam after webster 's death , in what is often referred to as the '' dictionary wars '' the american edition of charles annandale 's four volume revision of the imperial dictionary of the english language , published in 1883 by the century company , was more comprehensive than the unabridged the century dictionary , an expansion of the imperial first published from 1889 to 1891 , covered a larger vocabulary until the publication of webster 's second in 1934 , after the century had ceased publication in the 1970s , the oed began publishing supplements to its dictionary and in 1989 integrated the new words in the supplements with the older definitions and etymologies in its second edition between the 1930s and the 1950s , several college dictionaries , notably the american college dictionary and ( non-merriam ) webster 's new world dictionary , entered the market alongside the collegiate among larger dictionaries during this period was ( non-merriam ) webster 's universal dictionary ( also published as webster 's twentieth century dictionary ) which traced its roots to noah webster and called itself '' unabridged '' , but had less than half the vocabulary and paled in scholarship against the merriam editions after the commercial success of webster 's third new international in the 1960s , random house responded by adapting its college dictionary by adding more illustrations and large numbers of proper names , increasing its print size and page thickness , and giving it a heavy cover , highly critical of webster 's third , failed in an attempt to buy out merriam-webster and determined to create its own dictionary , the american heritage dictionary of the english language other medium-sized dictionaries have since entered the market , including the new oxford american and the encarta webster 's , while merriam-webster has not attempted to compete by issuing a similar edition .
