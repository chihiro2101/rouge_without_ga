a copy of isidorus ' edition of archimedes was made around 950 ad by an anonymous scribe , again in the byzantine empire , in a period during which the study of archimedes flourished in constantinople in a school founded by the mathematician , engineer , and former greek orthodox archbishop of thessaloniki , leo the geometer , a cousin to the patriarch on october 29 , 2008 , ( the tenth anniversary of the purchase of the palimpsest at auction ) all data , including images and transcriptions , were hosted on the digital palimpsest web page for free use under a creative commons license , the digital archimedes palimpsest released , dot porter , the stoa consortium , october 29 , 2008 the biblical scholar constantin von tischendorf visited constantinople in the 1840s , and , intrigued by the greek mathematics visible on the palimpsest he found in a greek orthodox library , removed a leaf of it ( which is now in the cambridge university library ) image : stomachion.jpg thumb ostomachion is a dissection puzzle in the archimedes palimpsest ( shown after suter from a different source ; this version must be stretched to twice the width to conform to the palimpsest ) in heiberg 's time , much attention was paid to archimedes ' brilliant use of indivisibles to solve problems about areas , volumes , and centers of gravity it contains : '' on the equilibrium of planes '' '' on spirals '' '' measurement of a circle '' '' on the sphere and cylinder '' '' on floating bodies '' '' the method of mechanical theorems '' '' stomachion '' speeches by the 4th century bc politician hypereides a commentary on aristotle 's categories by porphyry ( or by alexander of aphrodisias ) r shortly thereafter , during a turbulent period for the greek community in turkey that saw a turkish victory in the greco-turkish war ( 1919–22 ) along with the greek genocide and the forced population exchange between greece and turkey , the palimpsest disappeared from the greek church 's library in istanbul the board illustrated here , as also by netz , is one proposed by heinrich suter in translating an unpointed arabic text in which twice and equals are easily confused ; suter makes at least a typographical error at the crucial point , equating the lengths of a side and diagonal , in which case the board can not be a rectangle these letters were first compiled into a comprehensive text by isidorus of miletus , the architect of the hagia sophia patriarchal church , sometime around 530 ad in the then byzantine greek capital city of constantinople after imaging and digitally processing the entire palimpsest in three spectral bands prior to 2006 , in 2007 they reimaged the entire palimpsest in 12 spectral bands , plus raking light : uv : 365 nanometers ; visible light : 445 , 470 , 505 , 530 , 570 , 617 , and 625 & nbsp ; nm ; infrared : 700 , 735 , and 870 & nbsp ; nm ; and raking light : 910 and 470 & nbsp ; nm heiberg was permitted by the greek orthodox church to take careful photographs of the palimpsest 's pages , and from these he produced transcriptions , published between 1910 and 1915 in a complete works of archimedes keith knox ( then with boeing lts , now retired from the usaf research laboratory ) used computer processing of digital images from various spectral bands , including ultraviolet , visible , and infrared wavelengths to reveal most of the underlying text , including of archimedes '' in april 2007 , it was announced that a new text had been found in the palimpsest , which was a commentary on aristotle 's categories running to some 9 & nbsp ; 000 words '' though sirieix claimed to have bought the manuscript from a monk , who would not in any case have had the authority to sell it , sirieix had no receipt or documentation for a sale of the valuable manuscript in addition , after disappearing from the greek orthodox patriarchate 's library , a forger added copies of medieval evangelical portraits in gold leaf onto four pages in the book in order to increase its sales value , further damaging the text among those problems were that of calculating the center of gravity of a solid sphere , the center of gravity of a frustum of a circular paraboloid , and the area of a region bounded by a parabola and one of its secant lines for the codex board ( again as with tangram ) there are three ways to pack the pieces : as two unit squares side by side ; as two unit squares one on top of the other ; and as a single square of side the square root of two between them , an announced result concerned the volume of the intersection of two cylinders , a figure that apostol and mnatsakanian have renamed n & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 4 archimedean globe ( and the half of it , n & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 4 archimedean dome ) , whose volume relates to the n-polygonal pyramid there , in 1229 , the archimedes codex was unbound , scraped and washed , along with at least six other partial parchment manuscripts , including one with works of hypereides the resulting light beam has characteristics that make it ideal for revealing the intricate architecture and utility of many kinds of matter—in this case , the previously hidden work of one of the founding fathers of all science modern combinatorics reveals that the number of ways to place the pieces of the suter board to reform their square , allowing them to be turned over , is 17,152 ; the number is considerably smaller – 64 – if pieces are not allowed to be turned over when heiberg studied the palimpsest in constantinople in 1906 , he confirmed that the palimpsest included works by archimedes thought to have been lost reviel netz of stanford university and nigel wilson have produced a diplomatic transcription of the text , filling in gaps in heiberg 's account with these images at some point before 1840 the palimpsest was brought back by the greek orthodox patriarchate of jerusalem to its library ( the metochion of the holy sepulcher ) in constantinople in his other works , archimedes often proves the equality of two areas or volumes with eudoxus ' method of exhaustion , an ancient greek counterpart of the modern method of limits
