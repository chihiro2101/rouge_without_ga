however , it violates the other three : contrary to the first postulate , there is not a unique shortest route between any two points ( antipodal points such as the north and south poles on a spherical globe are counterexamples ) ; contrary to the third postulate , a sphere does not contain circles of arbitrarily great radius ; and contrary to the parallel postulate , there is no point through which a line can be drawn that never intersects a given line nevertheless , because its applications and pedagogy are tied to solid geometry , and because the generalization loses some important properties of lines in the plane , spherical geometry ordinarily does not use the term '' line '' at all to refer to anything on the sphere itself or , in the ( also intrinsic ) axiomatic approach analogous to euclid 's axioms of plane geometry , '' great circle '' is simply an undefined term , together with postulates stipulating the basic relationships between great circles and the also-undefined '' points '' if '' line '' is taken to mean great circle , spherical geometry obeys two of euclid 's postulates : the second postulate ( '' to produce extend a finite straight line continuously in a straight line '' ) and the fourth postulate ( '' that all right angles are equal to one another '' ) spherical trigonometry was studied by early greek mathematics such as theodosius of bithynia , a greek astronomer and mathematician who wrote the sphaerics , a book on the geometry of the sphere , and menelaus of alexandria , who wrote a book on spherical trigonometry called sphaerica and developed menelaus ' theorem each point is associated with a unique great circle , called the polar circle of the point , which is the great circle on the plane through the centre of the sphere and perpendicular to the diameter of the sphere through the given point this is more than an analogy ; spherical and plane geometry and others can all be unified under the umbrella of geometry riemannian geometry , where '' lines '' are defined to mean shortest paths ( geodesics ) in particular , it is orientability , or one-sided , and unlike the sphere it can not be drawn as a surface in 3-dimensional space without intersecting itself in spherical geometry , angles are defined between great circles , resulting in a spherical trigonometry that differs from ordinary trigonometry in many respects ; for example , the sum of the interior angles of a spherical triangle exceeds 180 degrees if developed as a part of solid geometry , use is made of points , straight lines and planes ( in the euclidean sense ) in the surrounding space the sum of the angles of a triangle on a sphere is , where f is the fraction of the sphere 's surface that is enclosed by the triangle there is a natural unit of angle measurement ( based on a revolution ) , a natural unit of length ( based on the circumference of a great circle ) and a natural unit of area ( based on the area of the sphere ) an important geometry related to that of the sphere is that of the real projective plane ; it is obtained by identifying antipodal points ( pairs of opposite points ) on the sphere this shows that a great circle is , with respect to distance measurement on the surface of the sphere , a circle : the locus of points all at a specific distance from a center many statements about the geometry of points and such '' lines '' are equally true in all those geometries provided lines are defined that way , and the theory can be readily extended to higher dimensions
