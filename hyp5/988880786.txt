for this reason , a '' simply connected nonblocking switch '' 16x16 switch with four input subswitches and four output switches was thought to require 7 middle switches ; in the worst case an almost-full input subswitch would use three middle switches , an almost-full output subswitch would use three different ones , and the seventh would be guaranteed to be free to make the last connection the crossbar switch has the property of being able to connect n inputs to n outputs in any bijection combination , so it can connect any caller to any non-busy receiver , a property given the technical term '' nonblocking '' however , a bit of work with a pencil and paper will show that it is easy to get such a minimal switch into conditions in which no single middle switch has a connection to both the needed input switch and the needed output switch if the recursion is taken to the limit , breaking down the crossbar to the minimum possible number of switching elements , the resulting device is sometimes called a crossover switch or a banyan switch depending on its topology intuitively this seems to mean that the number of inputs and the number of outputs can always be equal in each subswitch , but intuition does not prove this can be done nor does it tell us how to do so theoretically , in the example , only four central switches are needed , each with exactly one connection to each input switch and one connection to each output switch for this reason , sometimes this switch arrangement is called a '' 2n & minus ; 1 switch '' , where n is the number of input ports of the input subswitches if an output switch is also half full with connections from the other two middle switches , then there is no remaining middle switch which can provide a path between that input and output since telephone switches are symmetric ( callers and callees are interchangeable ) , the same logic will apply to the output layer , and the middle subswitches will be '' square '' , having the same number of inputs as outputs the basic algorithm for managing a three-layer switch is to search the middle subswitches for a middle subswitch that has unused wires to the needed input and output switches first , it is typical to '' fold '' the switch , so that both the input and output connections to a subscriber-line are handled by the same control logic in a modern digital telephone switch , application of two different multiplexer approaches in alternate layers further reduces the cost of the switching fabric : space-division multiplexers are something like the crossbar switches already described , or some arrangement of crossover switches or banyan switches this is called a '' minimal spanning switch , '' and managing it was the holy grail of the bell labs ' investigations in this list , each input subswitch can appear in at most two connections : one to subswitch a , and one to subswitch b each connection is linked to at most two others by a shared input or output subswitch , forming one link in a '' chain '' of connections since they have far fewer electrical connections to fail , they are far more reliable than space-division switches , and are therefore the preferred switches for the outer ( input and output ) layers of modern telephone switches '' this algorithm is a form of topological sort , and is the heart of the algorithm that controls a minimal spanning switch further , on the output side , we could also have 4 output subswitches , each with 4 outputs , for a total of 16 outputs those subswitches could in turn each be made of 3 & times ; 10 10 & times ; 10 crossbars , a total of 3000 contacts , making 900,000 for the whole exchange ; that is a far smaller number than 100 million if a and b happen to be the same middle-layer switch , then the connection can be made immediately just as in the '' 2nâˆ’1 '' switch case when this is done , each input or output subswitch in the chain has at most two connections passing through it , and they are assigned to different middle switches the algorithm proper only cares about the internal connections from input to output switch , although a practical implementation also has to keep track of the correct input and output switch connections the 1ess switch was still in limited use as of 2012 , and had a verified reliability of less than one unscheduled hour of failure in each thirty years of operation , validating its design on the first mother 's day that major cities operated with it , the bell system set a record for total network capacity , both in calls completed , and total calls per second per switch once a connectible middle subswitch is found , connecting to the correct inputs and outputs in the input and output switches is trivial the first step is to find an unused link from the input subswitch to a middle-layer subswitch ( which we shall call a ) , and an unused link from a middle-layer subswitch ( which we shall call b ) to the desired output subswitch shortly after replacement , the next test succeeds , the connections to the repaired subswitch are marked '' not busy , '' and the switch returns to full operation since , prior to the arrival of the new connection , the input and output subswitches each had at least one unused connection , both of these unused links must exist
