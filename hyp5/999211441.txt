the best-known form of imprinting is filial imprinting , in which a young animal narrows its social preferences to an object ( typically a parent ) as a result of exposure to that object it is one of the suggested explanations for the claim that the experiences of an infant , particularly during the first two years of his life , contribute to his lifelong developmental psychology the filial imprinting of birds was a primary technique used to create the movie winged migration ( le peuple migrateur ) , which contains a great deal of footage of migratory birds in flight at '' copulation '' , the breeder puts the flat of one hand on the female bird 's back to represent the weight of a male bird , and with the other hand uses a pipette , or a hypodermic syringe without a needle , to squirt the semen into the female 's cloaca steven pinker has written that freud 's conception of an urge to incest may have derived from freud 's own erotic reaction to his mother as a boy ( attested in freud 's own writings ) , and speculates that freud 's reaction may have been due to lack of intimacy with his mother in early childhood , as freud was wet-nursed '' baby duck syndrome : imprinting on your first system makes change a very hard thing '' , peter seebach , ibm developerworks , 2 march 2005 the issue may present itself relatively early in a computer user 's experience , and it has been observed to impede education of students in new software systems or user interfaces . sexual imprinting is the process by which a young animal learns the characteristics of a desirable mate ( 1913 ) totem and taboo in the standard edition of the complete psychological works of sigmund freud , vol xiii but westermarck argued the reverse , that the taboos themselves arise naturally as products of innate attitudes for example , the goslings would imprint on lorenz himself ( to be more specific , on his wading boots ) , and he is often depicted being followed by a gaggle of geese who had imprinted on him d'arrigo noted that the flight of a non-motorised hang-glider is very similar to the flight patterns of migratory birds ; both use updrafts of hot air ( thermal currents ) to gain altitude that then permits soaring flight over distance he flew across the sahara and over the mediterranean sea to sicily with eagles , from siberia to iran ( 5,500 & nbsp ; km ) with a flock of siberian cranes , and over mount everest with nepalese eagles the term is also described as the human emotional map , deep-seated beliefs , and values that are stored in the brain 's limbic system and govern people 's lives at the subconscious level in humanâ€“computer interaction , baby duck syndrome denotes the tendency for computer users to '' imprint '' on the first system they learn , then judge other systems by their similarity to that first system this result provides evidence not only that the westermarck effect is demonstrable but that it operates during the period from birth to the age of six
