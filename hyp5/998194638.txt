auranofin , a chelate complex of gold , is used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis , and penicillamine , which forms chelate complexes of copper , is used in the treatment of wilson 's disease and cystinuria , as well as refractory rheumatoid arthritis drew , who stated : '' the adjective chelate , derived from the great claw or chele ( greek ) of the lobster or other crustaceans , is suggested for the caliperlike groups which function as two associating units and fasten to the central atom so as to produce heterocyclic rings according to the association of american feed control officials ( aafco ) , a metal–amino acid chelate is defined as the product resulting from the reaction of metal ions from a soluble metal salt with amino acids , with a mole ratio in the range of 1–3 ( preferably 2 ) moles of amino acids for one mole of metal thus , metal chelates are relevant to the mobilization of metals in the soil , the uptake and the accumulation of metals into plants and microorganisms the word chelation is derived from greek χηλή , chēlē , meaning '' claw '' ; the ligands lie around the central atom like the claws of a lobster most fertilizers contain phosphate salts that , in the absence of chelating agents , typically convert these metal ions into insoluble solids that are of no nutritional value to the plants image : cu chelate.svg thumb cu 2+ complexes with nonchelating methylamine ( left ) and chelating ethylenediamine ( right ) ligands the chelate effect is the enhanced affinity of chelating ligands for a metal ion compared to the affinity of a collection of similar nonchelating ( monodentate ) ligands for the same metal although the treatment is often referred to as '' softening , '' chelation has little effect on the water 's mineral content , other than to make it soluble and lower the water 's ph level chelation in the intestinal tract is a cause of numerous interactions between drugs and metal ions ( also known as '' minerals '' in nutrition ) in general it is difficult to account precisely for thermodynamic values in terms of changes in solution at the molecular level , but it is clear that the chelate effect is predominantly an effect of entropy since the early development of these compounds , much more research has been conducted , and has been applied to human nutrition products in a similar manner to the animal nutrition experiments that pioneered the technology organic compounds such as the amino acids glutamic acid and histidine , organic diacids such as malate , and polypeptides such as phytochelatin are also typical chelators bifunctional chelate complexes of zirconium , gallium , fluorine , copper , yttrium , bromine , or iodine are often used for conjugation to monoclonal antibodies for use in antibody-based pet imaging these micronutrients ( manganese , iron , zinc , copper ) are required for the health of the plants
