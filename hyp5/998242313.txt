the following is a timeline of events in the history of antiandrogens : 1941 : hudgins and hodges show that androgen deprivation via high-dose estrogen therapy or surgical castration treats prostate cancer 1957 : the steroidal antiandrogen spironolactone is first synthesized 1960 : spironolactone is first introduced for medical use , as an antimineralocorticoid 1961 : the steroidal antiandrogen cyproterone acetate is first synthesized 1962 : spironolactone is first reported to produce gynecomastia in men 1963 : the antiandrogenic activity of cyproterone acetate is discovered 1966 : benorterone is the first known antiandrogen to be studied clinically , to treat acne and hirsutism in women 1967 : a known antiandrogen , benorterone , is first reported to induce gynecomastia in males 1967 : the first-generation nonsteroidal antiandrogen flutamide is first synthesized 1967 : cyproterone acetate was first studied clinically , to treat sexual deviance in men 1969 : cyproterone acetate was first studied in the treatment of acne , hirsutism , seborrhea , and scalp hair loss in women 1969 : the antiandrogenic activity of spironolactone is discovered 1972 : the antiandrogenic activity of flutamide is first reported 1973 : cyproterone acetate was first introduced for medical use , to treat sexual deviance 1977 : the first-generation antiandrogen nilutamide is first described 1978 : spironolactone is first studied in the treatment of hirsutism in women 1979 : combined androgen blockade is first studied 1980 : medical castration via a gnrh analogue is first achieved 1982 : the first-generation antiandrogen bicalutamide is first described 1982 : combined androgen blockade for prostate cancer is developed 1983 : flutamide is first introduced , in chile , for medical use , to treat prostate cancer 1987 : nilutamide is first introduced , in france , for medical use , to treat prostate cancer 1989 : combined androgen blockade via flutamide and a gnrh analogue is found to be superior to a gnrh analogue alone for prostate cancer 1989 : flutamide is first introduced for medical use in the united states , to treat prostate cancer 1989 : flutamide is first studied in the treatment of hirsutism in women 1992 : the androgen synthesis inhibitor abiraterone acetate is first described 1995 : bicalutamide is first introduced for medical use , to treat prostate cancer 1996 : nilutamide is first introduced for medical use in the united states , to treat prostate cancer 2006 : the second-generation nonsteroidal antiandrogen enzalutamide is first described sawyers , c , ethinylestradiol , diethylstilbestrol ) , which stimulate sex hormone-binding globulin ( shbg ) production in the liver and thereby decrease free and hence bioactive levels of testosterone and dht ; anticorticotropins such as glucocorticoids , which suppress the adrenocorticotropic hormone ( acth ) -induced production of adrenal androgens ; and immunogens and vaccines against androstenedione like ovandrotone albumin and androstenedione albumin , which decrease levels of androgens via the generation of antibody against the androgen and androgen precursor androstenedione ( used only in veterinary medicine ) these differences are thought related to the fact that antigonadotropins suppress androgen levels and by extension levels of bioactive metabolites of androgens like estrogens and neurosteroids whereas selective ar antagonists similarly neutralize the effects of androgens but leave levels of androgens and hence their metabolites intact ( and in fact can even increase them as a result of their progonadotropic effects ) anticorticotropins such as glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids work by exerting negative feedback on the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis ( hpa axis ) , thereby inhibiting the secretion of corticotropin-releasing hormone ( crh ) and hence adrenocorticotropic hormone ( acth ; corticotropin ) and consequently suppressing the production of androgen prohormones like dehydroepiandrosterone ( dhea ) , dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate ( dhea-s ) , and androstenedione in the adrenal gland the term antiandrogen is generally used to refer specifically to ar antagonists , as described by dorfman ( 1970 ) : however , in spite of the above , the term may also be used to describe functional antiandrogens like androgen synthesis inhibitors and antigonadotropins , including even estrogens and progestogens examples include gnrh modulators like leuprorelin ( a gnrh agonist ) and cetrorelix ( a gnrh antagonist ) , progestogens like allylestrenol , chlormadinone acetate , cyproterone acetate , gestonorone caproate , hydroxyprogesterone caproate , medroxyprogesterone acetate , megestrol acetate , osaterone acetate ( veterinary ) , and oxendolone , and estrogens like estradiol , estradiol esters , ethinylestradiol , conjugated estrogens , and diethylstilbestrol although they are described as antiandrogens and indeed show only such effects generally , most or all steroidal ar antagonists are actually not silent antagonists of the ar but rather are weak partial agonists and are able to activate the receptor in the absence of more potent ar agonists like testosterone and dht in accordance with this notion , ar ntd antagonists are active against splice variants of the ar , which conventional ar antagonists are not , and ar ntd antagonists are immune to gain-of-function mutations in the ar lbd that convert ar antagonists into ar agonists and commonly occur in prostate cancer they are rarely used clinically as functional antiandrogens , but are used as such in the case of congenital adrenal hyperplasia in girls and women , in which there are excessive production and levels of adrenal androgens due to glucocorticoid deficiency and hence hpa axis overactivity for instance , whereas antigonadotropic antiandrogens like gnrh modulators and cyproterone acetate are associated with pronounced sexual dysfunction and osteoporosis in men , selective ar antagonists like bicalutamide are not associated with osteoporosis and have been associated with only minimal sexual dysfunction in men , a study found that treatment with a relatively low dosage of 20 & nbsp ; μg/day ethinylestradiol for 5 & nbsp ; weeks increased circulating shbg levels by 150 % and , due to the accompanying decrease free testosterone levels , increased total circulating levels of testosterone by 50 % ( via reduced negative feedback by androgens on the hpg axis ) whereas conventional ar antagonists bind to the lbd of the ar and competitively displace androgens , thereby preventing them from activating the receptor , ar ntd antagonists bind covalently to the ntd of the ar and prevent protein–protein interactions subsequent to activation that are required for transcription ( biology ) in addition to use in transgender women , antiandrogens , mainly gnrh modulators , are used as puberty blockers to prevent puberty in transgender girls until they are older and ready to begin hormone therapy 5α-reductase inhibitors like finasteride , dutasteride , and alfatradiol and the topical nonsteroidal ar antagonist topilutamide ( fluridil ) are approved for the treatment of pattern hair loss , also known as scalp hair loss or baldness in addition , antiandrogens can cause infertility , osteoporosis , hot flashes , sexual dysfunction ( including loss of libido and erectile dysfunction ) , depression , fatigue , anemia , and decreased ejaculation volume in males the side effects of antiandrogens vary depending on the type of antiandrogen – namely whether it is a selective ar antagonist or lowers androgen levels – as well as the presence of off-target activity in the antiandrogen in question in accordance , antiandrogens are used in the treatment of conditions of sexual deviance such as hypersexuality ( excessively high sex drive ) and paraphilias ( atypical and sometimes societally unacceptable sexual interests ) like pedophilia ( sexual attraction to children ) hyperandrogenism is associated with virilization – that is , the development of masculine secondary sexual characteristics like male-pattern facial and body hair growth ( or hirsutism ) , voice change , increased muscle mass and strength , and broadening of the shoulders , among others ar antagonists act by directly binding to and competitively displacing androgens like testosterone and dht from the ar , thereby preventing them from activating the receptor and mediating their biological effects they work by enhancing the degradation of the ar , and are analogous to selective estrogen receptor degraders ( serds ) like fulvestrant ( a drug used to treat estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer ) the most common methods of androgen deprivation therapy currently employed to treat prostate cancer are castration ( with a gnrh modulator or orchiectomy ) , nonsteroidal antiandrogens , and the androgen synthesis inhibitor abiraterone acetate in accordance , therapeutic modalities that reduce androgen signaling in the prostate gland , referred to collectively as androgen deprivation therapy , are able to significantly slow the course of prostate cancer and extend life in men with the disease these drugs include the steroidal antiandrogens cyproterone acetate , megestrol acetate , chlormadinone acetate , spironolactone , oxendolone , and osaterone acetate ( veterinary ) and the nonsteroidal antiandrogens flutamide , bicalutamide , nilutamide , topilutamide , enzalutamide , and apalutamide steroidal antiandrogens include compounds like cyproterone acetate , spironolactone , estradiol , abiraterone acetate , and finasteride ; nonsteroidal antiandrogens include compounds like bicalutamide , elagolix , diethylstilbestrol , aminoglutethimide , and ketoconazole ; and peptides include gnrh analogues like leuprorelin and cetrorelix cyproterone acetate was developed subsequently to high-dose estrogen and is the only steroidal antiandrogen that has been widely used in the treatment of prostate cancer , but it has largely been replaced by nonsteroidal antiandrogens , which are newer and have greater effectiveness , tolerability , and safety ketoconazole and abiraterone acetate are inhibitors of the enzyme cyp17a1 , also known as 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase , which is responsible for the conversion of pregnane steroids into androgens , as well as the conversion of mineralocorticoids into glucocorticoids the combination of a primary antigonadotropin such as cyproterone acetate to prevent fertility and an androgen like testosterone to prevent systemic androgen deficiency , resulting in a selective antiandrogenic action locally in the testes , has been extensively studied and has shown promising results , but has not been approved for clinical use at this time examples include the cyp17a1 inhibitors ketoconazole , abiraterone acetate , and seviteronel , the cyp11a1 ( p450scc ) inhibitor aminoglutethimide , and the 5α-reductase inhibitors finasteride , dutasteride , epristeride , alfatradiol , and saw palmetto extract ( serenoa repens ) estrogens that are or that have been used as antigonadotropins include estradiol , estradiol esters like estradiol valerate , estradiol undecylate , and polyestradiol phosphate , conjugated estrogens , ethinylestradiol , diethylstilbestrol ( no longer widely used ) , and bifluranol as an example , steroidal ar antagonists are able to increase prostate weight and accelerate prostate cancer cell growth in the absence of more potent ar agonists , and spironolactone has been found to accelerate progression of prostate cancer in case reports antiandrogens are used in the treatment of androgen-dependent skin and hair diseases including acne , seborrhea , hidradenitis suppurativa , hirsutism , and pattern hair loss in women in accordance , dht is involved in the pathophysiology of benign prostatic hyperplasia , pattern hair loss , and hirsutism , and 5α-reductase inhibitors are used to treat these conditions they are used to treat men with prostate cancer , benign prostatic hyperplasia , pattern hair loss , hypersexuality , paraphilias , and priapism , as well as boys with precocious puberty antiandrogens are also used in transgender women as a component of feminizing hormone therapy and as puberty blockers in transgender girls in addition to their antigonadotropic effects , estrogens are also functional antiandrogens by decreasing free concentrations of androgens via increasing the liver production of sex hormone-binding globulin ( shbg ) and by extension circulating shbg levels peptide antiandrogens are a new type of ar antagonist that , unlike all currently marketed ar antagonists , bind to the n-terminal domain ( ntd ) of the ar rather than the ligand-binding domain ( lbd ) in addition , circulating therapeutic concentrations of nonsteroidal antiandrogens are very high , on the order of thousands of times higher than those of testosterone and dht , and this allows them to efficaciously compete and block ar signaling a newer drug currently under development for treatment of prostate cancer , seviteronel , is selective for inhibition of the 17,20-lyase functionality of cyp17a1 , and for this reason , unlike earlier drugs , does not require concomitant treatment with a glucocorticoid androgen-dependent skin and hair conditions like acne and pattern hair loss may also occur in hyperandrogenism , and menstrual disturbances , like amenorrhea , are commonly seen however , combined oral contraceptives that contain the particularly androgenic progestin levonorgestrel have been found to increase shbg levels by only 50 to 100 % , which is likely because activation of the ar in the liver has the opposite effect of estrogen and suppresses production of shbg
