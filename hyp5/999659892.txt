consequently , surviving greek new testament manuscripts from before the ninth century are relatively rare , but nine ( over half of the total that survive ) witness a more-or-less pure alexandrian text a number of substantial papyrus manuscripts of portions of the new testament survive from earlier still , and those that can be ascribed a text-type , such as and from the second to the third century , also tend to witness to the alexandrian text the earliest coptic versions of the bible ( into a sahidic variety of the late second century ) use the alexandrian text as a greek base ; although other second and third century translations ( into latin and syriac ) tend rather to conform to the western text-type around 17 such manuscripts have been discovered so far and so the alexandrian text-type is witnessed by around 30 surviving manuscripts , by no means all of which are associated with egypt although in that area , alexandrian witnesses are the most prevalent list of notable manuscripts represented alexandrian text-type : ; other manuscripts : papyri : , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ( ? ) , , , ( ? ) , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , minuscules : 20 , 94 , 104 ( epistles ) , 157 , 164 , 215 , 241 , 254 , 256 ( paul ) , 322 , 323 , 326 , 376 , 383 , 442 , 579 ( except matthew ) , 614 , 718 , 850 , 1006 , 1175 , 1241 ( except acts ) , 1243 , 1292 ( cath when compared to witnesses of the byzantine text type , alexandrian manuscripts tend : to have a larger number of abrupt readings , such as the shorter ending of the gospel of mark , which finishes in the alexandrian text at mark 16:8 ( '' '' ; to have a higher proportion of '' difficult '' readings , as in matthew 24:36 , which reads in the alexandrian text '' but of that day and hour no one knows , not even the angels of heaven , nor the son , but the father only '' ; whereas the byzantine text omits the phrase '' nor the son '' , thereby avoiding the implication that jesus lacked full divine foreknowledge also , there are a number of readings where the byzantine text displays variation between synoptic passages , that is not found in either the western or alexandrian texts , as in the rendering into greek of the aramaic last words of jesus , which are reported in the byzantine text as '' eloi , eloi a few textual critics , especially those in france , argue that the western text-type , an old text from which the vetus latina or old latin versions of the new testament are derived , is closer to the originals they assert that egypt , almost alone , offers optimal climatic conditions favoring preservation of ancient manuscripts while , on the other hand , the papyri used in the east ( asia minor and greece ) would not have survived due to the unfavourable climatic conditions the argument for the authoritative nature of the latter is that the much greater number of byzantine manuscripts copied in later centuries , in detriment to the alexandrian manuscripts , indicates a superior understanding by scribes of those being closer to the autographs thus , whereas the early 3rd century papyrus witnesses a text in luke and john that is very close to that found a century later in the codex vaticanus , the nearly contemporary has a much freer text of john ; with many unique variants ; and others that are now considered distinctive to the western and byzantine text-types , albeit that the bulk of readings are alexandrian in 1796 , in the second edition of his greek new testament , griesbach added codex vaticanus as witness to the alexandrian text in mark , luke , and john see edition from 1809 ( london ) johann leonhard hug ( 1765â€“1846 ) suggested that the alexandrian recension was to be dated about the middle of the 3rd century , and it was the purification of a wild text , which was similar to the text of codex bezae starting with karl lachmann ( 1850 ) , manuscripts of the alexandrian text-type have been the most influential in modern , critical editions of the greek new testament , achieving widespread acceptance in the text of westcott & hort ( 1881 ) , and culminating in the united bible society 4th edition and nestle-aland 27th edition of the new testament
