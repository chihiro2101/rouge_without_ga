the principal legal issue remains , however , since nato as such is not a member state of the un , whether the member states of nato , the united states and the european powers that sent armed forces to attack as part of the nato bombing campaign , violated the un charter by attacking a fellow un member state : ( 1 ) in the absence of un security council authorization , and ( 2 ) in the absence of an attack or a threat of imminent attack on them on the day the bombing started , russia called for the un security council to meet to consider '' an extremely dangerous situation caused by the unilateral military action of the north atlantic treaty organization ( nato ) against the federal republic of yugoslavia '' in particular , article 51 states that nothing in the present charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a member of the united nations , until the security council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security in april 1999 , the development of this humanitarian crisis as well as accusations of genocide were used by policy-makers in the united states and europe to legally justify the campaign on the basis of '' humanitarian law '' , allowing for intervention where large scale human rights violations are occurring after the war ended with the kumanovo treaty and the bombing stopped , some argued that the creation on 10 june 1999 of the un interim administration mission in kosovo ( unmik ) , by security council resolution 1244 ( 1999 ) , constituted a legal ratification post festum ( after the event ) the united nations considers nato to be a '' regional arrangement '' under un article 52 , which allows it to deal with matters relating to the maintenance of international peace and security as are appropriate for regional action provided that such arrangements or agencies and their activities are consistent with the purposes and principles of the united nations nato had justified the actions in kosovo under article 4 of its charter , the north atlantic treaty , which allows involved parties to consult together whenever political independence or security of any of the parties is threatened article 2 ( 4 ) of the un charter prohibits the use of force by un member states to resolve disputes , but with two specific exceptions to this general prohibition : :1 it has been argued that pursuant to article 52 of the 1980 vienna convention on the law of treaties , had serbia signed the rambouillet agreement , the agreement would have been void due to the threat or use of force to compel serbian acceptance aside from the above-discussed issue of the jus ad bellum against serbia , the nato bombing campaign has been criticized for exceeding the limits of jus in bello under international humanitarian law , such as the geneva conventions critics of this theory argue , however , that the purpose of article 5 is to require all nato members to respond when any nato member is attacked , not to restrict the circumstances under which nato may choose to use force
