in jewish philosophy and in kabbalah , divine simplicity is addressed via discussion of the attributes of god , particularly by jewish philosophy within the islam sphere of influence such as saadia gaon , bahya ibn paquda , yehuda halevi , and maimonides , as well by raabad iii in provence a classic expression of this position is found in maimonides ' guide to the perplexed , according to maimonides , then , there can be no plurality of faculties , moral dispositions , or essential attributes in god even to say that god is all-knowing , all-powerful , and all-good is to introduce plurality , if one means thereby that these qualities are separate attributes maimonides therefore concludes that it is not true to say that god 's power is greater than ours , that god 's life is more permanent than ours , or that god 's knowledge is broader than ours maimonedes believed that statements such as '' god lives '' or '' god is powerful '' are nonsense if they are interpreted in the normal fashion , but they can be understood if one analyzes them as disguised negations some identify divine simplicity as a corollary of creationism : '' in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth '' ( genesis 1:1 ) ) the implication – of either approach – is so strong that the two concepts are often presented as synonymous : '' god is not two or more entities , but a single entity of a oneness even more single and unique than any single thing in creation… he can not be sub-divided into different parts & mdash ; therefore , it is impossible for him to be anything other than one on the other hand , it is understood that god 's essence contains every possible element of perfection : '' the first foundation is to believe in the existence of the creator , blessed be he the resultant paradox is famously articulated by moshe chaim luzzatto ( derekh hashem i:1:5 ) , describing the dichotomy as arising out of our inability to comprehend the idea of absolute unity : the kabbalah address this paradox by explaining that “ god created a spiritual dimension… through which god interacts with the universe in other words , property simplicity ( or metaphysical simplicity ) states that the characteristics of god are not parts of god that together make up god and so , in terms of subjects and accidents , as in the phrase '' goodness of god '' , divine simplicity allows that there is a conceptual distinction between the person of god and the personal attribute of goodness , but the doctrine disallows that god 's identity or '' character '' is dependent upon goodness , and at the same time the doctrine dictates that it is impossible to consider the goodness in which god participates separately from the goodness which god is furthermore , according to some kant , the critique of pure reason ? , as creatures our concepts are all drawn from the creation ( the assumption of empiricism ) ; it follows from this and divine simplicity that god 's attributes can only be spoken of by analogy , since it is not true of any created thing that its properties are identical to its being consequently , when christian scripture is interpreted according to the guide of divine simplicity , when it says that god is good for example , it should be taken to speak of a likeness to goodness as found in humanity and referred to in human speech god 's essence is ineffability ; this likeness is nevertheless truly comparable to god who simply is goodness , because humanity is a complex being composed by god '' in the image and likeness of god if none of our concepts apply to god , then it is sheer confusion to say there is such a person as god , and yet god does not have properties such as wisdom , being the creator , and being almighty ' if god transcends human experience , then we can not say something univocal about god , since such a claim presupposes that we know what it means to transcend human experience , and that it applies to god '' plantinga also gives three criticisms of the doctrine of metaphysical simplicity directly , stating that it is exceedingly hard to grasp or construe the doctrine , and it is difficult to see why anyone would be inclined to accept it plantinga states that this seems to clash with the obvious fact that the property of being a horse is distinct from the property of being a turkey and both are distinct from god and his essence secondly , plantinga argues , if one restricts the realm of abstract objects that are identical with god to only the properties that god exemplifies , the doctrine is still problematic this flies in the face of the idea that god has both power and mercifulness , neither of which is identical with the other this does n't mean that god has physical parts , but that the implications of the doctrine of metaphysical simplicity are too problematic to maintain the doctrine avicenna supported and elaborated this position , al-ghazali contested this identification of divine essence and existence , but still saw all divine attributes and acts as enveloped in and indistinct from the divine essence , this latter view of divine simplicity was shared with some of the most trenchant critics of the muslim philosophical writers , like ibn taymiyyah aseity ein sof ( a jewish kabalistic concept of divine unity ) essence–energies distinction ( trinitarian , panentheism doctrine of the eastern orthodox church ) pantheism ( conception of god ) tawhid ( the islamic concept of divine unity ) sufi metaphysics ( sufi conception of god which borders on pantheistic and panentheistic conceptions ) '' trinity , simplicity and the status of god 's personal relations '' , international journal of systematic theology 16 ( 1 ) ( 2014 ) : 79–98 divine simplicity reasonable faith divine simplicity , stanford encyclopedia of philosophy divine simplicity , internet encyclopedia of philosophy god and other necessary beings , stanford encyclopedia of philosophy shaar hayichud – the gate of unity , dovber schneuri – a detailed explanation of the paradox of divine simplicity .
