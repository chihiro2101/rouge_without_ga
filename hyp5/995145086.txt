' ( like a jam session ) and old rheinhold cacoethes the father of the frisco poetry scene was wiping his tears in gladness thus the final collection contained several other poems written at that time ; with these poems , ginsberg continued the experimentation with long lines and a fixed base he 'd discovered with the composition of '' howl '' and these poems have likewise become some of ginsberg 's most famous : '' america '' , '' sunflower sutra '' , '' a supermarket in california '' , etc called by ginsberg '' a lament for the lamb in america with instances of remarkable lamb-like youths '' , part i is perhaps the best known , and communicates scenes , characters , and situations drawn from ginsberg 's personal experience as well as from the community of poets , artists , political radicals , jazz musicians , drug addicts , and psychiatric patients whom he encountered in the late 1940s and early 1950s in '' notes written on finally recording howl , '' ginsberg writes , '' i depended on the word 'who ' to keep the beat , a base to keep measure , return to and take off from again onto another streak of invention '' ginsberg was inspired to write part ii during a period of peyote-induced visionary consciousness in which he saw a hotel façade as a monstrous and horrible visage which he identified with that of moloch , the bible idol in leviticus to whom the canaanites sacrificed children moloch is also the name of an industrial , demonic figure in fritz lang 's metropolis , a film that ginsberg credits with influencing '' howl , part ii '' in his annotations for the poem ( see especially howl : original draft facsimile , transcript & variant versions ) part iii , in relation to parts i , ii and iv , is '' a litany of affirmation of the lamb in its glory '' , according to ginsberg it is directly addressed to carl solomon , whom ginsberg met during a brief stay at a psychiatric hospital in 1949 ; called '' rockland '' in the poem , it was actually columbia presbyterian psychological institute on june 3 shig murao , the bookstore manager , was arrested and jailed for selling howl and other poems to an undercover san francisco police officer at the obscenity trial , nine literary experts testified on the poem 's behalf ; ferlinghetti , a published poet himself , is credited ( by david skover and ronald k supported by the american civil liberties union , ferlinghetti won the case when superior courts of california judge clayton horn decided that the poem was of '' roth v part one of '' howl '' was broadcast in finland on september 30 , 1969 , on yleisradio 's ( finland 's national public-broadcasting company ) '' parallel programme '' at 10:30 & nbsp ; p.m the interpellation text only contained a short extract of six lines ( considered to be offensive , and representative of the poem ) of over seventy from the poem , and the debate was mainly based upon them finally , the ministry of transport and public works considered in december 1969 that the broadcast of '' howl '' contravened the licence of operation of yleisradio : it was neither educational nor useful allen ginsberg.org the poetry archive : allen ginsberg allen ginsberg on poets.org with audio clips , poems , and related essays , from the academy of american poets full text of '' howl '' and '' footnote to howl '' at the poetry foundation allen ginsberg reads howl naropa audio archives : allen ginsberg class ( august 6 , 1976 ) streaming audio and 64 kbit/s mp3 zip naropa audio archives : anne waldman and allen ginsberg reading , including howl ( august 9 , 1975 ) streaming audio and 64 kbit/s mp3 zip allen ginsberg live in london -- live film from october 19 , 1995 after 50 years , ginsberg 's '' howl '' still resonates reading of howl and other poems at reed college , portland , oregon , february 1956 howls of anger , and of liberation by the nation '' howl for carl solomon '' , manuscript and typescript , with autograph corrections and annotations , stanford digital repository
