the most common minerals that are generally considered to be the most representative of marine evaporites are calcite , gypsum and anhydrite , halite , sylvite , carnallite , langbeinite , polyhalite , and kainite however , there are approximately 80 different minerals that have been reported found in evaporite deposits ( stewart , 1963 ; warren , 1999 ) , though only about a dozen are common enough to be considered important rock formers non-marine evaporites are usually composed of minerals that are not common in marine environments because in general the water from which non-marine evaporite precipitates has proportions of chemical elements different from those found in the marine environments non-marine deposits may also contain halite , gypsum , and anhydrite , and may in some cases even be dominated by these minerals , although they did not come from ocean deposits ( ed ) 1991 , evaporites , petroleum and mineral resources ; elsevier , amsterdam thick non-marine deposits that accumulate tend to form where evaporation rates will exceed the inflow rate , and where there is sufficient soluble supplies the inflow also has to occur in a closed basin , or one with restricted outflow , so that the sediment has time to pool and form in a lake or other standing body of water saline lakes includes things such as perennial lakes , which are lakes that are there year-round , playa lakes , which are lakes that appear only during certain seasons , or any other terms that are used to define places that hold standing bodies of water intermittently or year-round a.jorgensen and c.j.cleveland , national council for science and the environment , washington dc for a formation to be recognised as evaporitic it may simply require recognition of halite pseudomorphs , sequences composed of some proportion of evaporite minerals , and recognition of mud crack textures or other textures : \begin image : hanksite.jpg thumb hanksite , na 22 k ( so 4 ) 9 ( co 3 ) 2 cl , one of the few minerals that is both a carbonate and a sulfate halides : halite , sylvite ( kcl ) , and fluorite sulfates : such as gypsum , barite , and anhydrite nitrates : nitratine ( soda niter ) and niter borates : typically found in arid-salt-lake deposits plentiful in the southwestern us the minerals precipitate out of solution in the reverse order of their solubilities , such that the order of precipitation from sea water is : calcite ( caco 3 ) and dolomite ( camg ( co 3 ) 2 ) gypsum ( caso 4 and anhydrite ( caso 4 ) instead of water oceans , titan hosts lakes of titan ( mainly methane ) with many soluble hydrocarbons , such as acetylene , that can evaporate out of solution
