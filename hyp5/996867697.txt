in particular the distinction is important for sexual interests , which are the most obvious interests that group-entities can not have , having no sexual feelings , and able to deal in sex only as a commodity not as a direct organismic interest , e.g a response to this argument is that groups also do not feel hunger , but can act as a means for individuals to satisfy their hunger - this being the main motive for the corporation and collective economic effort , back to earliest systems of irrigation corporate mergers , for instance , are often presented as relationships of equals cooperating , but in fact usually one executive group or the other will be drastically reduced , the organizational structure and ethics of one of the two being obliterated an interesting question is whether a family which exists primarily or only to provide economic , infrastructural , instructional and emotional support to specific individuals who are related , is a group-entity distinct from feelings or methods of individual sexual animals the iks , a people he used as example , were not longer able to hunt and pursue their forest lifestyle , and when forced to become farmers were reduced to playing cruel practical jokes on each other , revelling in each other 's errors and misfortunes , and squabbling in ways that reminded thomas of the united nations , i.e accordingly , nationalism and the interaction between nation-states ( or the political party that control them ) might be the most appropriate or least controversial application of the theory of group-entities being malignant or inherently competitive and unable to cooperate for common benefit such bases for organization would seem , like that of the kin , clan , or family , to align biological and group interests , and therefore overcome the objections that group and individual entities have nothing in common accordingly , eco-anarchism and the looser green anarchisms , and related theories in green economics such as that of trustee stewardship of the commons , are more likely to perceive group-entity actions as benign if the group entity itself has a biological or ecological parameter , mission or scope for instance , watersheds as borders , or a migration corridors as a right of way , could align the interests of the biological creatures that rely on these to the group-entities that succeed via effective management of them
