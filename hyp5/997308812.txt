isotopic oxygen is incorporated into the body primarily through ingestion at which point it is used in the formation of , for archaeological purposes , bones and teeth the isotopic oxygen ratios , then , of teeth represent the ratios of the region in which the individual was born and raised breast milk production draws upon the body water of the mother , which has higher levels of 18 o due to the preferential loss of 16 o through sweat , urine , and expired water vapour carbon , nitrogen and zinc isotope ratios are used to investigate the diets of past people ; these isotopic systems can be used with others , such as strontium or oxygen , to answer questions about population movements and cultural interactions , such as trade carbon isotope ratios can be measured in bone collagen or bone mineral ( hydroxylapatite ) , and each of these fractions of bone can be analysed to shed light on different components of diet to obtain an accurate picture of palaeodiets , it is important to understand processes of diagenesis that may affect the original isotopic signal it is also important for the researcher to know the variations of isotopes within individuals , between individuals , and over time particularly in the bronze age mediterranean , lead isotope analysis has been a useful tool for determining the sources of metals and an important indicator of trade patterns all biologically active elements exist in a number of different isotopic forms , of which two or more are stable the ratio of the two isotopes may be altered by biological and geophysical processes , and these differences can be utilized in a number of ways by ecologists the main elements used in isotope ecology are carbon , nitrogen , oxygen , hydrogen and sulfur , but also include silicon , iron , and strontium the standard reference materials for carbon , nitrogen , and sulfur are δ13c limestone , nitrogen gas in the atmosphere , and cañon diablo meteorite respectively the main advantage to using stable isotope analysis as opposed to stomach content observations is that no matter what the status is of the animal 's stomach ( empty or not ) , the isotope tracers in the tissues will give us an understanding of its trophic position and food source the transfer of 13 c through trophic levels remains relatively the same , except for a small increase ( an enrichment 13 c between animals indicate that they have different food sources or that their food webs are based on different primary producers ( i.e ( 1997 ) found that when analyzing a variety of creatures ( such as particulate organic matter ( phytoplankton ) , zooplankton , mysids , sprat , smelt and herring , ) there was an apparent fractionation of 2.4‰ between consumers and their apparent prey analysis of the ratio of 18 o to 16 o in the shells of the colorado delta clam was used to assess the historical extent of the estuary in the colorado river delta prior to construction of upstream dams hydrogen isotope ratios in animal tissue reflect diet , including drinking water , and have been used to study bird migration and aquatic food webs the stable isotopic ratios of drinking water are a function of location , and the geology that the water percolates through most high explosives contain carbon , hydrogen , nitrogen and oxygen atoms and thus comparing their relative abundances of isotopes can reveal the existence of a common origin in isotope hydrology , stable isotopes of water ( 2 h and 18 o ) are used to estimate the source , age , and flow paths of water flowing through ecosystems variability in water isotopes is used to study sources of water to streams and rivers , evaporation rates , groundwater recharge , and other hydrological processes the ratio of 18 o to 16 o in ice and deep sea cores is temperature dependent , and can be used as a proxy measure for reconstructing climate change similarly , ice cores on land are enriched in the heavier 18 o relative to 16 o during warmer climatic phases ( interglacials ) as more energy is available for the evaporation of the heavier 18 o isotope oxygen isotopes preserve a record of the effects of the milankovitch cycles on climate change during the quaternary , revealing an approximately 100,000-year cyclicity in the earth 's climate .
