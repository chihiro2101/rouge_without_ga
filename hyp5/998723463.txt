some of the important factors are the volume of oxide relative to the volume of the parent metal , the mechanism of oxygen diffusion through the metal oxide to the parent metal , and the relative chemical potential of the oxide in the mid 1800s , christian friedrich schönbein discovered that when a piece of iron is placed in dilute nitric acid , it will dissolve and produce hydrogen , but if the iron is placed in concentrated nitric acid and then returned to the dilute nitric acid , little or no reaction will take place lillie measured the effect of an active piece of iron touching a passive iron wire and found that '' a wave of activation sweeps rapidly ( at some hundred centimeters a second ) over its whole length '' in the late 1950s , atalla further discovered that the formation of a thermally grown sio 2 layer greatly reduced the concentration of surface states , and discovered the important quality of sio 2 films to preserve the electrical characteristics of p–n junctions and prevent these electrical characteristics from deteriorating by the gaseous ambient environment atalla developed the surface passivation process , a new method of semiconductor device fabrication that involves coating a silicon wafer with an insulating layer of silicon oxide so that electricity could reliably penetrate to the conducting silicon below by growing a layer of silicon dioxide on top of a silicon wafer , atalla was able to overcome the surface states that prevented electricity from reaching the semiconducting layer he discovered that when a thin layer of silicon dioxide was grown on the surface of silicon where a p–n junction intercepts the surface , the leakage current of the junction was reduced by a factor from 10 to 100 according to fairchild semiconductor engineer chih-tang sah , the surface passivation process developed by atalla 's team '' blazed the trail '' that led to the development of the silicon integrated circuit atalla 's surface passivation method was the basis for several important inventions in 1959 : the mosfet ( mos transistor ) by atalla and dawon kahng at bell labs , the planar process by jean hoerni at fairchild semiconductor , and the monolithic integrated circuit chip by robert noyce at fairchild in 1959 in carbon quantum dot ( cqd ) technology , cqds are small carbon nanoparticles ( less than 10 & nbsp ; nm in size ) with some form of surface passivation aluminium naturally forms a thin surface layer of aluminium oxide on contact with oxygen in the atmosphere through a process called oxidation , which creates a physical barrier to corrosion or further oxidation in many environments chemical conversion coating on aluminum chromate conversion is a common way of passivating not only aluminium , but also zinc , cadmium , copper , silver , magnesium , and tin alloys ferrous materials , including steel , may be somewhat protected by promoting oxidation ( '' rust '' ) and then converting the oxidation to a metalophosphate by using phosphoric acid and further protected by surface coating one common mode of corrosion in corrosion-resistant steels is when small spots on the surface begin to rust because grain boundaries or embedded bits of foreign matter ( such as grinding swarf ) allow water molecules to oxidize some of the iron in those spots despite the alloying chromium however , proprietary passivation processes exist for martensitic stainless steel , which is difficult to passivate , as microscopic discontinuities can form in the surface of a machined part during passivation in a typical nitric acid bath the passivation process removes exogenous iron , creates/restores a passive oxide layer that prevents further oxidation ( rust ) , and cleans the parts of dirt , scale , or other welding-generated compounds ( e.g with citric acid , simply rinsing and drying the part and allowing the air to oxidise it , or in some cases the application of other chemicals , is used to perform the passivation of the surface
