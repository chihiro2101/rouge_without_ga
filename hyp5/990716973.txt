he has attributed his early interest in underwater exploration to reading the 1870 jules verne novel twenty thousand leagues under the sea , living by the ocean in san diego , and his fascination with the groundbreaking expeditions of the bathyscaphe trieste ballard began working for andreas rechnitzer 's ocean systems group at north american aviation in 1962 when his father , chet , the chief engineer at north american aviation 's lgm-30 minuteman program , helped him get a part-time job while a student in santa barbara , california , he joined sigma alpha epsilon fraternity , and also completed the us army 's rotc program , giving him an army officer 's commission in army intelligence his first graduate degree ( ms , 1966 ) was in geophysics from the university of hawaii 's institute of geophysics where he trained porpoises and whales ballard 's first dive in a submersible was in the ben franklin ( px-15 ) in 1969 off the coast of florida during a woods hole oceanographic institution expedition while ballard had been interested in the sea since an early age , his work at woods hole and his scuba diving experiences off massachusetts spurred his interest in shipwrecks and their exploration his work in the navy had involved assisting in the development of small , unmanned submersibles that could be tethered to and controlled from a surface ship , and were outfitted with lighting , cameras , and manipulator arms navy for secret reconnaissance of the wreckage of two navy nuclear powered attack submarines , the uss scorpion and the uss thresher , which sank in the 1960s , and not for the titanic back in 1982 , he approached the navy about his new deep sea underwater robot craft , the argo , and his search for the titanic the navy agreed it would finance his titanic search only if he first searched for and investigated the two sunken submarines , and found out the state of their nuclear reactors after being submerged for such a long time , and whether their radioactivity was impacting the environment he was placed on temporary active duty in the navy , in charge of finding and investigating the wrecks in 1988 , ballard published a book , discovery of the titanic : exploring the greatest of all lost ships , and he later recounted the specifics of the expedition for national geographic in a video ballard undertook an even more daunting task when he and his team searched off the coast of france for the german battleship bismarck in 1989 , using an ocean-crawling robot the actual cause of the sinking , however , was sabotage of the underwater valves by the onboard crew , according to ballard , who said , '' we found a hull that appears whole and relatively undamaged by the descent and impact '' ballard published a book about the discovery , exploring the lusitania : probing the mysteries of the sinking that changed history , also titled robert ballard 's lusitania in some markets , with co-author spencer dunmore in 1992 , ballard and his team visited the sites of many wrecks of world war ii in the pacific his book lost ships of guadalcanal locates and photographs many of the vessels sunk in the infamous ironbottom sound , the strait between guadalcanal island and the floridas in the solomon islands the visit also brought to light the identity of islanders biuku gasa and eroni kumana who had received little recognition for finding the shipwrecked crew after searching for days in their dugout canoe a tv special and a book were produced , and ballard spoke at the john f in 2003 , ballard started the center for ocean exploration and archaeological oceanography , a research program at the university of rhode island 's graduate school of oceanography in a series of expeditions , a team of marine archaeologists led by ballard identified what appeared to be ancient shorelines , freshwater snail shells , and drowned river valleys in roughly 300 feet ( 100 m ) of water off the black sea coast of modern turkey to the east of sinop , the team discovered a remarkably well-preserved wreck at a 320 m depth , in the black sea 's deep anoxic waters in 2000 , the team conducted an expedition that focused on the exploration of the sea bed about 15–30 & nbsp ; km west of sinop , and an additional deep-water survey east and north of the peninsula they sought to discover whether human habitation sites could be identified on the ancient submerged landscape , they examined the sea-bed for shipwrecks ( where they found sinop a-d ) , to test the hypothesis that the anoxic waters below 200 m would protect shipwrecks from the expected biological attacks on organic components , and to seek data about an ancient trade route between sinop and the crimea indicated by terrestrial archaeological remains although sinop served as a primary trade center in the black sea , the wrecks were located west of the trade route predicted by the prevalence of sinopian ceramics on the crimean peninsula the wreck found provided the team with vast information about both the technological changes and trade that occurred in the black sea during a period of political , social and economic transition through their study of the ship 's construction techniques , 2001 , black sea coastal cultures : trade and interaction , expedition 43 : 11–20 the examination of the four shipwrecks found by ballard and his team provide the direct evidence for black sea maritime trade so well attested by the distribution of ceramics on land the amphorae highest on the mound had fallen over without displacing those still standing in the rows beneath them , and it is likely that the ship settled upright on the sea-bed , gradually being both buried in and filled with sediment as exposed wood was devoured by the larva or the shipworm the angle of the mast and the lack of fittings on it suggest that a lateen sail is the most likely configuration for such a small vessel , and ward , cheryl , 2004 , deep-water archaeological survey in the black sea ;
