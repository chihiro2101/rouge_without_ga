cm ) measured diagonally , an av receiver or pre-amplifier ( surround processor ) and amplifier combination capable of at least stereo sound but preferably 5.1 channel dolby digital and dts audio , and something that plays or broadcasts movies in at least stereo sound such as a vhs hi-fi vcr , laserdisc player ( no new stand-alone models of either are available ; vhs vcrs are usually bundled in combo decks with dvd players ) , a dvd player , a blu-ray disc player , cable or satellite receiver , video game console , etc the audio system requires at least a stereo power amplifier and two speakers , for stereo sound ; most systems have multi-channel surround sound power amplifier and six or more speakers ( a 5.1 surround sound system has left and right front speakers , a centre speaker , left and right rear speakers and a low-frequency subwoofer speaker enclosure ) a more expensive home cinema set-up might include a blu-ray disc player , home theater pc ( htpc ) computer or digital media receiver streaming devices with a 10-foot user interface , a high-definition video projector and projection screen with over diagonal screen size ( or a large flatscreen hdtv ) , and a several-hundred-watt home theater receiver with five to eleven surround-sound speakers plus one or two powerful subwoofers beginning in the late 1990s , and continuing throughout much of the 2000s , home-theater technology progressed with the development of the dvd-video format ( higher resolution than vhs ) , dolby digital 5.1-channel audio ( '' surround sound '' ) speaker systems , and high-definition television ( hdtv ) , which initially included bulky , heavy cathode ray tube hdtvs and flat screen tvs the most-expensive home cinema set-ups , which can cost over 100,000 us , and which are in the homes of executives , celebrity and high-earning professionals , have expensive , large , high-resolution digital projectors and projection screens , and maybe even custom-built screening rooms which include cinema-style chairs and audiophile-grade sound equipment designed to mimic ( or sometimes even exceed ) commercial cinema performance a typical home cinema includes the following components : movie or other viewing content : as the name implies , one of the key reasons for setting up a home cinema is to watch movies on a large screen , which does a more effective job at reproducing filmed images of vast landscapes or epic battle sequences the most basic and economical system could be a dvd player , a standard definition ( sd ) large-screen television with at least a 27-inch ( 69 & nbsp ; cm ) diagonal screen size , and an inexpensive '' home theater in a box '' surround sound amplifier/speaker system with a subwoofer newer lossless audio from dolby digital plus , dolby truehd , digital theater system and dts-hd master audio and speaker systems with more audio channels ( such as 6.1 , 7.1 , 9.1 , 9.2 , 10.2 , and 22.2 ) were also introduced for a more cinematic feeling in the 2000s , developments such as high-definition video , blu-ray disc ( as well as the now-obsolete hd dvd format , which lost the format war to blu-ray ) and newer high-definition 3d display technologies enabled people to enjoy a cinematic feeling in their own home at a more-affordable price in some movie enthusiast 's home cinemas , this idea can go as far as completely recreating an actual small-scale cinema , with a projector enclosed in its own projection booth , specialized furniture , curtains in front of the projection screen , movie posters , or a popcorn or vending machine with snack food and candy as of 2016 , the days of the 100,000 and over home cinema system is being usurped by the rapid advances in digital audio and video technologies , which has spurred a rapid drop in prices , making a home cinema set-up more affordable than ever before by the mid-2010s , the blu-ray disc medium had become a common home media standard , and online video streaming sources such as netflix , hulu and youtube were offering a range of high definition content , including some 4k content ( although various compression technologies are applied to make this streamed content feasible ) in the late 1990s , a new wave of home-cinema interest was sparked by the development of dvd-video , dolby digital and dts 5.1-channel audio , and high-quality front video projectors that provide a cinema experience at a price that rivals a big-screen hdtv audio and video processing devices : input signals are processed by either a standalone av receiver or a preamplifier and sound processor for complex surround sound formats such as dolby pro-logic/and or pro-logic ii , x , and z , dolby digital , dts , dolby digital ex , dts-es , dolby digital plus , dolby truehd , dts-hd master audio , dolby atmos and dts x in the early to mid-1990s , a typical home cinema would have a laserdisc player or vhs vcr fed to a large screen : rear projection for the more-affordable setups , and lcd or crt front-projection in the more-elaborate systems the development of multi-channel audio systems and later laserdisc in the 1980s created a new paradigm for home video , as it enabled movie enthusiasts to add better sound and images to their setup in the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s , a typical home cinema in the united states would have a laserdisc or vhs player playing a movie , with the signal fed to a large rear-projection television set the benefit of purchasing separate components one by one is that consumers can attain improved quality in video or audio and better matching between the components and the needs of a specific room , or the consumer 's needs depending on the space available , it may simply be a temporary version with foldable screen , a video projector and couple of speakers , or a permanent fixture with a huge screen and dedicated audio set-up mounted in a weather-proof cabinet htib systems typically include a dvd or blu-ray player , a surround sound amplifier , five surround speakers , a subwoofer cabinet , cables and a remote ) or a by purchasing a htib ( home theater in a box ) package which includes all of components from a single manufacturer , with the exception of a tv or projector over the course of three days , retailers , manufacturers , and members of the consumer electronics press were exposed to the first '' home-like '' experience of combining a high-quality video source with multi-channel surround sound finally a set of speakers , at least two , are needed but more common are anywhere from six to eight with a subwoofer for bass or low-frequency effects for one user with a modest budget , '' good quality '' may mean a mainstream consumer electronics brand ;
