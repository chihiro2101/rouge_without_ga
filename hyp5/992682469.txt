joachim du bellay was born at the castle of la turmelière , not far from liré , near angers , being the son of jean du bellay , lord of gonnor , first cousin of the cardinal jean du bellay and of guillaume du bellay both his parents died while he was still a child , and he was left to the guardianship of his elder brother , rené du bellay , who neglected his education , leaving him to run wild at la turmelière it was probably in 1547 that du bellay met ronsard in an inn on the way to poitiers , an event which may justly be regarded as the starting-point of the french school of renaissance poetry the famous manifesto of the pléiade , the défense et illustration de la langue française ( defense and illustration of the french language , 1549 ) , was at once a complement and a refutation of sébillet 's treatise this book ( inspired in part by sperone speroni 's dialogo delle lingue , 1542 ) was the expression of the literary principles of the pléiade as a whole , but although ronsard was the chosen leader , its redaction was entrusted to du bellay du bellay maintained that the french language as it was then constituted was too poor to serve as a medium for the higher forms of poetry , but he contended that by proper cultivation it might be brought on a level with the classical tongues sébillet replied in the preface to his translation of the iphigenia of euripides ; guillaume des autels , a lyonnese poet , reproached du bellay with ingratitude to his predecessors , and showed the weakness of his argument for imitation as opposed to translation in a digression in his réplique aux furieuses defenses de louis meigret ( lyons , 1550 ) ; barthélemy aneau , regent of the collège de la trinité at lyons , attacked him in his quintil horatian ( lyons , 1551 ) , the authorship of which was commonly attributed to charles fontaine du bellay replied to his various assailants in a preface to the second edition ( 1550 ) of his sonnet sequence olive , with which he also published two polemical poems , the musagnaeomachie , and an ode addressed to ronsard , contre les envieux fioles du bellay did not actually introduce the sonnet into french poetry , but he acclimatized it ; and when the fashion of sonneteering became a mania he was one of the first to ridicule its excesses in 1559 du bellay published at poitiers la nouvelle manière de faire son profit des lettres , a satirical epistle translated from the latin of adrien turnèbe , and with it le poète courtisan , which introduced the formal satire into french poetry the nouvelle manière is believed to be directed at pierre de paschal , who was elected as royal historiographer , and who had promised to write latin biographies of the great , but who in fact never wrote anything of the sort a long and eloquent discours au roi ( detailing the duties of a prince , and translated from a latin original written by michel de l'hôpital , now lost ) was dedicated to francis ii in 1559 , and is said to have secured for the poet a tardy pension , although it was not published until 1567 , after his death du bellay 's health was weak ; his deafness seriously hindered his official duties ; and on 1 january 1560 he died at the age of 38 de la langue française ( 1905 ) , with biographical and critical introduction by léon séché , who also wrote joachim du bellay -- documents nouveaux et inédits ( 1880 ) , and published in 1903 the first volume of a new edition of the œuvres lettres de joachim du bellay ( 1884 ) , edited by pierre de nolhac walter pater , '' joachim du bellay '' , essay in the renaissance ( 1873 ) pp & nbsp ; 155–176 george wyndham , ronsard and la pléiade ( 1906 ) hilaire belloc , avril ( 1905 ) arthur tilley , the literature of the french renaissance ( 2 vols biography , bibliography , analysis university of virginia 's gordon project a 1569 edition of du bellay 's works and background information the first complete translation into english of du bellay 's antiquités de rome since spenser lyrics of the french renaissance : marot , du bellay , ronsard by norman r
