standard anatomy and zoology terms of location have been developed , usually based on latin and greek words , to enable all biological and medical scientists , veterinarians , doctors and anatomists to precisely delineate and communicate information about animal bodies and their organs , even though the meaning of some of the terms often is context-sensitive much of this information has been standardised in internationally agreed vocabularies for humans ( terminologia anatomica ) and animals ( nomina anatomica veterinaria ) for humans , one type of vertebrate , and other animals that stand on two feet ( bipeds ) , terms that are used are different from those that stand on four ( quadrupeds ) one reason is that humans have a different neuraxis and another is that unlike animals that rest on four limbs , humans are considered when describing anatomy as being in the standard anatomical position , which is standing up with arms outstretched thus , what is on '' top '' of a human is the head , whereas the '' top '' of a dog may be its back , and the '' top '' of a flounder could refer to either its left or its right side because animals can change orientation with respect to their environment , and because appendages like limbs and tentacles can change position with respect to the main body , terms to describe position need to refer to an animal when it is in its standard anatomical position for example , '' anterolateral '' indicates a position that is both anterior and lateral to the body axis ( such as the bulk of the pectoralis major muscle ) in radiology , an x-ray image may be said to be '' anteroposterior '' , indicating that the beam of x-rays passes from their source to patient 's anterior body wall through the body to exit through posterior body wall anatomical axes.svg anatomical axes in a human , similar for other orthograde posture vertebrates anatomical directions and axes.jpg anatomical axes and directions in a fish long and short axis.png spheroid or near-spheroid organs such as testis may be measured by '' long '' and '' short '' axis other terms are used as suffixes , added to the end of words : -ad and ab- are used to indicate that something is towards ( -ad ) or away from ( -ab ) something else for example , '' distad '' means '' in the distal direction '' , and '' distad of the femur '' means '' beyond the femur in the distal direction '' for example , in the anatomical position , the most superior part of the human body is the head and the most inferior is the feet for example , in a dog the nose is anterior to the eyes and the tail is considered the most posterior part ; in many fish the gill openings are posterior to the eyes but anterior to the tail for example , it is very confusing to say the dorsal fin of a dolphin is '' right of '' the left pectoral fin , but is '' left of '' the right eye , but much easier and clearer to say '' the dorsal fin is medial to the pectoral fins '' varus and valgus are terms used to describe a state in which a part further away is abnormally placed towards ( varus ) or away from ( valgus ) the midline the terms proximal and distal are used to describe parts of a feature that are close to or distant from the main mass of the body , respectively although the direction indicated by '' proximal '' and '' distal '' is always respectively towards or away from the point of attachment , a given structure can be either proximal or distal in relation to another point of reference these two terms , used in anatomy and embryology , describe something at the back ( dorsal ) or front/belly ( ventral ) of an organism to describe how close to the head of an animal something is , three distinct terms are used : rostral describes something situated toward the oral or nasal region , or in the case of the brain , toward the tip of the frontal lobe general zoology laboratory manual mcgraw-hill , and in humans , '' cranial '' and '' cephalic '' are used to refer to the skull , with '' cranial '' being used more commonly the term '' rostral '' is rarely used in human anatomy , apart from embryology , and refers more to the front of the face than the superior aspect of the organism structures may be described as being at the level of a specific spinal vertebra , depending on the section of the vertebral column the structure is at for example , structures at the level of the fourth cervical vertebra may be abbreviated as '' c4 '' , at the level of the fourth thoracic vertebra '' t4 '' , and at the level of the third lumbar vertebra '' l3 '' this is because although teeth may be aligned with their main axes within the jaw , some different relationships require special terminology as well ; for example , teeth also can be rotated , and in such contexts terms like '' anterior '' or '' lateral '' become ambiguous for example , the terms '' distal '' and '' proximal '' are also redefined to mean the distance away or close to the dental arch , and '' medial '' and '' lateral '' are used to refer to the closeness to the midline of the dental arch for example , the top of a dog 's paw is its dorsal surface ; the underside , either the palmar ( on the forelimb ) or the plantar ( on the hindlimb ) surface these terms are used to avoid confusion when describing the median surface of the hand and what is the '' anterior '' or '' posterior '' surface '' anterior '' can be used to describe the hand of the hand , and '' posterior '' can be used to describe the back of the hand and arm anteversion and retroversion are complementary terms describing an anatomical structure that is rotated forwards ( towards the front of the body ) or backwards ( towards the back of the body ) , relative to some other position two related terms , '' abaxial '' and '' adaxial '' , refer to locations away from and toward the central axis of an organism , respectively luminal : on the—hollow—inside of an organ 's lumen ( body cavity or tubular structure ) ; adluminal is towards , abluminal is away from the lumen different terms are used because of different body plans in animals , whether animals stand on one or two legs , and whether an animal is symmetrical or not , as discussed above humans do not have a beak , so a term such as '' rostral '' used to refer to the beak in some animals is instead used to refer to part of the brain ; humans do also not have a tail so a term such as '' caudal '' that refers to the tail end may also be used in humans and animals without tails to refer to the hind part of the body some such borrowed terms are widely applicable in most invertebrates ; for example proximal , meaning '' near '' refers to the part of an appendage nearest to where it joins the body , and distal , meaning '' standing away from '' is used for the part furthest from the point of attachment in organisms with a changeable shape , such as amoeboid organisms , most directional terms are meaningless , since the shape of the organism is not constant and no distinct axes are fixed in such organisms , the end with a mouth ( or equivalent structure , such as the cytostome in paramecium or stentor ) , or the end that usually points in the direction of the organism 's locomotion ( such as the end with the flagellum in euglena ) , is normally designated as the anterior end properly , this terminology would apply only to an organism that is always planktonic ( not normally attached to a surface ) , although the term can also be applied to one that is sessile ( normally attached to a surface ) the part of the organism attached to the substrate is usually referred to as the basal end , whereas the end furthest from the attachment is referred to as the apical end cnidarians ( jellyfish , sea anemones and corals ) have an incomplete digestive system , meaning that one end of the organism has a mouth , and the opposite end has no opening from the gut ( coelenteron ) for this reason , the end of the organism with the mouth is referred to as the oral end , and the opposite surface is the aboral end '' lateral '' , '' dorsal '' , and '' ventral '' have no meaning in such organisms , and all can be replaced by the generic term peripheral eyes are labelled according to their position as anterior and posterior lateral eyes ( ale ) and ( ple ) ;
