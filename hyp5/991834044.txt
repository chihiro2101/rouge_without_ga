in the mid-19th century , karl marx presented a schema of stages of historical development , by introducing the notion that human nature was not constant and was not determinative of the nature of the social system ; on the contrary , he made it a principle that human behavior was a function of the social and economic system in which it occurred ( 2005 ) comparing economic systems in the twenty-first century , seventh edition , south-western college publishing , at approximately the same time , charles darwin developed a general framework for comprehending any process whereby small , random variations could accumulate and predominate over time into large-scale changes that resulted in the emergence of wholly novel forms ( '' speciation '' ) this was followed shortly after by the work of the american pragmatic philosophers ( peirce , james , dewey ) and the founding of two new disciplines , psychology and anthropology , both of which were oriented toward cataloging and developing explanatory frameworks for the variety of behavior patterns ( both individual and collective ) that were becoming increasingly obvious to all systematic observers he began his career in the midst of this period of intellectual ferment , and as a young scholar came into direct contact with some of the leading figures of the various movements that were to shape the style and substance of social sciences into the next century and beyond veblen saw the need for taking account of cultural variation in his approach ; no universal '' human nature '' could possibly be invoked to explain the variety of norms and behaviors that the new science of anthropology showed to be the rule , rather than the exception he emphasised the conflict between '' industrial '' and '' pecuniary '' or ceremonial values and this veblenian dichotomy was interpreted in the hands of later writers as the '' ceremonial/instrumental dichotomy '' ( hodgson 2004 ) ; veblen saw that every culture is materially based and dependent on tools and skills to support the '' life process '' , while at the same time , every culture appeared to have a stratified structure of status ( '' invidious distinctions '' ) that ran entirely contrary to the imperatives of the '' instrumental '' ( read : '' technological '' ) aspects of group life arguably the most important works by veblen include , but are not restricted to , his most famous works ( the theory of the leisure class ; the theory of business enterprise ) , but his monograph imperial germany and the industrial revolution and the 1898 essay entitled why is economics not an evolutionary science have both been influential in shaping the research agenda for following generations of social scientists the translators of the day used the word '' development '' from the french '' d√©veloppement '' , as opposed to '' evolution '' as this was used by darwin one of the major contributions to the emerging field of evolutionary economics has been the publication of an evolutionary theory of economic change by richard nelson and sidney g if the change occurs constantly in the economy , then some kind of evolutionary process must be in action , and there has been a proposal that this process is darwinism in nature oded galor and omer moav advanced the hypothesis that evolutionary forces had a significant role in the transition of the world economy from stagnation to growth , highlighting the persistent effects that historical and prehistorical conditions have had on the evolution of the composition of human characteristics during the development process lineages whose traits were complementary to the economic environment had higher income , and therefore higher reproductive success , and the inevitable propagation of these traits fostered the growth process and ultimately contributed to the take-off from an epoch of stagnation to the modern era of sustained growth galor and moav hypothesize that during the malthusian epoch , natural selection has amplified the prevalence of traits associated with predispositions towards the child quality in the human population , triggering human capital formation , technological progress , the onset of the demographic transition , and the emergence of & nbsp ; sustained economic growth they theorize and confirm empirically that the evolution of loss aversion reflects an evolutionary process in which humans have gradually adapted the climatic shocks and their asymmetric effects on reproductive success in a period in which the available resource was very close to the subsistence consumption a different approach is to apply evolutionary psychology principles to economics which is argued to explain problems such as inconsistencies and biases in rational choice theory a basic economic concept such as utility may be better explained in terms of a set of biological preferences that maximized evolutionary fitness in the ancestral environment but not necessarily in the current one humans , therefore , may have poor intuitive understanding the benefits of free trade ( causing calls for protectionism ) , the value of capital goods ( making the labor theory of value appealing ) , and may intuitively undervalue the benefits of technological development there may be a tendency to see the number of available jobs as a zero-sum game with the total number of jobs being fixed which causes people to not realize that minimum wage laws reduce the number of jobs or to believe that an increased number of jobs in other nations necessarily decreases the number of jobs in their own nation this may easily cause poor economic policies , especially since individual voters have few incentives to make the effort of studying societal economics instead of relying on their intuitions since an individual 's vote counts for so little and since politicians may be reluctant to take a stand against intuitive views that are incorrect but widely held .
