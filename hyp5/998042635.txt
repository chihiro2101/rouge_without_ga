suppes 's §8.5 the problem of division by zero begins this way : '' that everything is not for the best in this best of all possible worlds , even in mathematics , is well illustrated by the vexing problem of defining the operation of division in the elementary theory of arithmetic '' ( p considering the example above , setting x , if x equals ten divided by zero , then x times zero equals ten , but there is no x that , when multiplied by zero , gives ten ( or any number other than zero ) the four basic operations – addition , subtraction , multiplication and division – as applied to whole numbers ( positive integers ) , with some restrictions , in elementary arithmetic are used as a framework to support the extension of the realm of numbers to which they apply loosely speaking , since division by zero has no meaning ( is undefined ) in the whole number setting , this remains true as the setting expands to the real or even complex numbers so , for dividing by zero , what is the number of cookies that each person receives when 10 cookies are evenly distributed amongst 0 people at a table ? certain words can be pinpointed in the question to highlight the problem on september 21 , 1997 , a division by zero error in the '' remote data base manager '' aboard uss yorktown ( cg-48 ) brought down all the machines on the network , causing the ship 's propulsion system to fail zero divided by a negative or positive number is either zero or is expressed as a fraction with zero as numerator and the finite quantity as denominator to be certain this definition does not lead to a contradiction , it should be preceded by the following theorem : there exists exactly one number x such that , for any number y , one has : y + x y '' & nbsp ; 189 ) wherein he asks for a proof of the following : '' in section 53 , the definition of the number ' 0 ' was stated by way of an example & nbsp ; 91–109 , a philosophy paper from 2005 , reintroduced the ( ancient indian ) idea of an applicable whole number equal to 1/0 , in a more modern ( cantorian ) style . in any integer partition of 5 things into 2 parts , either one of the parts of the partition will have more elements than the other , or there will be a remainder ( written as 2 r1 )
