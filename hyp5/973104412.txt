the methods employed by sedimentologists to gather data and evidence on the nature and depositional conditions of sedimentary rocks include ; measuring and describing the outcrop and distribution of the rock unit ; describing the rock formation , a formal process of documenting thickness , lithology , outcrop , distribution , contact relationships to other formations mapping the distribution of the rock unit , or units descriptions of rock core ( drilled and extracted from wells during hydrocarbon exploration ) sequence stratigraphy describes the progression of rock units within a basin describing the lithology of the rock ; petrology and petrography ; particularly measurement of texture , grain size , grain shape ( sphericity , rounding , etc the aim of sedimentology , studying sediments , is to derive information on the depositional conditions which acted to deposit the rock unit , and the relation of the individual rock units in a basin into a coherent understanding of the evolution of the sedimentary sequences and basins , and thus , the earth 's geological history as a whole art : marble , although a metamorphosed limestone , is an example of the use of sedimentary rocks in the pursuit of aesthetics and art architectural uses : stone derived from sedimentary rocks is used for dimension stone and in architecture , notably slate , a meta-shale , for roofing , sandstone for load-bearing buttresses ceramics and industrial materials : clay for pottery and ceramics including bricks ; cement and lime derived from limestone the scientific basis of this is the principle of uniformitarianism , which states that the sediments within ancient sedimentary rocks were deposited in the same way as sediments which are being deposited at the earth 's surface today the law of superposition is critical to the interpretation of sedimentary sequences , and in older metamorphic terrains or fold and thrust belts where sediments are often intensely folded or deformed , recognising younging indicators or graded bedding is critical to interpretation of the sedimentary section and often the deformation and metamorphic structure of the region sedimentological conditions are recorded within the sediments as they are laid down ; the form of the sediments at present reflects the events of the past and all events which affect the sediments , from the source of the sedimentary material to the stresses enacted upon them after diagenesis are available for study organic sedimentary rocks are important deposits formed from the accumulation of biological detritus , and form coal and oil shale deposits , and are typically found within basins of clastic sedimentary rocks carbonates are composed of various carbonate minerals ( most often calcium carbonate ( caco 3 ) ) precipitated by a variety of organic and inorganic processes tsujita , earth , an introduction to physical geology , national library of canada cataloguing in publication , 2005 , chemical sedimentary rocks , including some carbonates , are deposited by precipitation of minerals from aqueous solution economic geology : sedimentary rocks host large deposits of sedex ore deposits of lead-zinc-silver , large deposits of copper , deposits of gold , tungsten , uranium , and many other precious minerals , gemstones and industrial minerals including heavy mineral sands ore deposits energy : petroleum geology relies on the capacity of sedimentary rocks to generate deposits of petroleum oils
