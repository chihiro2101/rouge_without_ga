point of view , lüneburg heath is a specific natural region , that is an area distinguished by a specific combination of abiotic factors ( climate , relief , water resources , soil , geology ) and biotic factors ( flora and fauna ) lüneburg heath covers an area which includes the districts ( landkreise ) of celle , gifhorn , heidekreis , uelzen , lüneburg , lüchow-dannenberg , southeast rotenburg ( the town of visselhövede , fintel , part of the municipality of scheeßel and the eastern half of bothel ) and the landkreis harburg the easternmost fringes of the stade geest belonging to landkreis verden are called the linteln geest ( lintelner geest ) or verden heath ( verdener heide ) and form part of the municipality of kirchlinteln lüneburg heath lies between the rivers elbe to the north , the drawehn to the east , the aller to the south and southwest , the middle course of the wümme to the west and the harburg hills ( harburger berge ) to the northwest other hills over high are : falkenberg , near bergen , ahrberg , hakenberg , hoher mechtin , pampower berg , lüßberg , brunsberg , near sprötze , goldbockenberg , hingstberg , staffelberg , hengstberg , höpenberg near schneverdingen , haußelberg , breithorn , mützenberg , tellmer berg , wümmeberg , schiffberg , hummelsberg and wulfsberg ( each , drullberg and thonhopsberg ( each , kruckberg and wietzer berg ( each and höllenberg several of these hills - the wilseder berg , the falkenberg , the haußelberg and the breithorn - were used by the mathematician , carl friedrich gauss , as triangulation stations in his topographical surveys of the kingdom of hanover from 1821–1825 rivers in the area , beside the numerous small heathland streams , include the wümme , which rises on the western slopes of the wilseder berg , in the south the lachte with its tributary the lutter , and the aller , the vissel , the böhme , the grindau , the meiße and the örtze due to the lack of vegetation , the much more rugged terrain at that time was heavily eroded by water , wind and by soil fluction ; this resulted in valleys like the totengrund in contrast to the areas in the north of lüneburg heath , the landscape is very hilly , as it is placed on a terminal moraine lüneburg heath is divided into the following natural sub-divisions : hohe heide : the hohe heide ( '' high heath '' ) consists of a series of end moraines from the glaciers of the saalian glaciation ( 230,000–130,000 years ago ) with the wilseder berg at its heart thumb in the northwestern part of lüneburg heath is the lüneburg heath nature park which covers an area of at its heart , around the wilseder berg , is the lüneburg heath nature reserve ( naturschutzgebiet or nsg ) founded as long ago as 1921 with of land which is roughly 58 % woods and 20 % heathland the lüneburg heath nsg , together with the open heathland of the huge munster training area and the bergen-hohne training area , is the largest single area of heathland in central europe left image : lüneburger heide - 043.jpg thumb left path near undeloh image : bodenprofil heide.jpg thumb left soil profile of heath podsol showing the hardpan after the end of the weichselian ice age ( 115,000 to 10,000 years ago ) the first woods appeared in the area that now forms lüneburg heath which , following the natural ecological succession and encouraged by a gradual improvement in the climate , progressed from birch and pine trees through hazel woods to light woods of sessile oaks the heath and its surrounding area belong to those regions of the north german plain in which the hunter culture of the mesolithic era was superseded quite early on by neolithic farmers by about 3000 bc , during the neolithic , large open areas appeared on the lightly undulating , sandy stretches of geest on lüneburg heath over a long period of time the region of lüneburg heath alternated between periods when the heathlands spread and dominated the scene and times when it was largely covered with forest and only small areas of heath existed 721 image : steingrund 009.jpg thumb herd of heidschnucken ( moorland sheep ) not until after 1000 ad does the pollen analysis show a continuous reduction in the woodlands and a considerable increase in calluna the typical heath farming economy emerged : due to the poor soils the few available nutrients from a large area were concentrated on relatively small fields , from which grain , in particular , could be produced this was achieved by the regular removal of the turf ( a method known as plaggen ) , which was used as hay for the pens of the moorland sheep , the heidschnucken the oft-expressed view in the literature that the heath arose in the middle ages as a result of the demand for wood by the lüneburg salt pans is incorrect the amount required , even in the heyday of production , could have been continuously supplied by an area of woodland about 50 & nbsp ; km 2 in area , yet the heath covers over 7000 & nbsp ; km 2 in any case the wood certainly did not come from the heath , but via the waterways , especially from mecklenburg up the elbe and from the area of the schaalsee transportation overland would have been far too expensive ( apart from the river ilmenau which was navigable at the time , no rivers flow from the main areas of heathland to lüneburg ) , as can be seen not only from some of the delivery notes which still survive , but also from the fact that there are still large woods around lüneburg itself , such as the göhrde finally heathland has frequently developed in areas where there are no salt pans , such as the sheep-grazing regions on the coasts of norway to portugal and in scotland and ireland in order to prevent its semi-open heathland from being repopulated by trees , especially pines and , to a lesser extent , silver birches , which would cause the loss of this millennia-old environment and its many inhabitants , including often very rare animal and plant species , sheep are allowed to graze it regularly ; these are almost exclusively the local german moorland sheep , the heidschnucke in the 20th century , numerous conservation measures were implemented on lüneburg heath ; as a result , it is one of the best researched regions of central europe sand heaths form about 20 % of the lüneburg heath nature reserve and may be broken down into further sub-divisions , the most important being : thumb ; ordinary sand heath ( typische sandheide , genisto-callunetum ) in addition to the common heather ( calluna vulgaris ) only a few taller plants occur here , none of which can be classed as characteristic species this reduction in the variety of heathland types may be due to increasing nitrogen levels from the air , the increase in plant litter ( rohhumusauflagen ) and the natural ageing of the heathland 163ff image : lüneburger heide 057.jpg lichen-rich sand heath north of niederhaverbeck image : lüneburger heide 132.jpg clay heath south of

forests , which were planted in the second half of the 19th century on former heathland and drifting sand many species of animal live on lüneburg heath , particularly birds that are at home in the wide , open landscape , some of which are seriously threatened by the intensive-farming techniques in other areas these include the : black grouse ( tetrao tetrix ) , the nightjar ( caprimulgus europaeus ) , the woodlark ( lullula arborea ) , the great grey shrike ( lanius excubitor ) , the red-backed shrike ( lanius collurio ) , the northern wheatear ( oenanthe oenanthe ) , the wryneck ( jynx torquilla ) , the european green woodpecker ( picus viridis ) , the stonechat ( saxicola torquata ) , the eurasian curlew ( numenius arquata ) , the common quail ( coturnix coturnix ) and the black stork ( ciconia nigra ) after the withdrawal of the lombards in the migration period , from about 700 ad lüneburg heath belonged to the duchy of saxony , which was conquered by charlemagne in the 9th century and became part of the frankish empire image : dat ole hus 003.jpg thumb wilsede heath museum – a typical timber-framed hall house ( fachhallenhaus ) lüneburg heath was always relatively sparsely populated due to the poor soils in the area the region was dominated by heath farming which was a less intensive form of land usage necessary for its large areas of barren terrain and heathland today , by contrast the only large , continuous areas of heath remaining are in the lüneburg heath nature reserve and on a few military training areas as late as the turn of the 18th to the 19th century , the barren and almost treeless heathlands were still perceived as hostile and threatening environments , as evinced by two travel logs of journeys between 1799 and 1804 : : : : — charles gottlob küttner : travels through denmark , sweden , austria and part of italy , in 1798 & 1799 55 books.google the poem der heideknabe ( '' the heath lad '' ) from the year 1844 by friedrich hebbel stresses the unearthly atmosphere and the bleak solitude of the heaths : towards the middle of the 19th century the first positive descriptions of the heath emerged , initially inspired by the romantic movement his works were a source for heimatfilme that were shot on lüneburg heath , such as grün ist die heide ( '' the heath is green '' ) from 1932 and remade in 1951 and 1972 , as well as rot ist die liebe ( '' red is love '' ) from 1956 although plans to build a motorway through the park and for the heath to be used as a military training area were stopped , in 1933 the heidewacht was disbanded , mainly because it was made up of members of social democratic youth organisations thumb between 1891 and the second world war , large military training areas were established on lüneburg heath , including the largest one in europe , the bergen-hohne training area on the südheide a large area of the nature park belonging to the society near schneverdingen was taken over by the british army of the rhine in 1945 for use as a tank training area not until the soltau-lüneburg agreement , was signed in 1959 between the federal republic of germany , the united kingdom and canada , were the boundaries of the tank training area fixed in 1994 , the british returned the so-called '' red areas '' of the soltau-lüneburg training area to the nature park society who , with the help of money from the federal government , set about the work of renaturation the heath was the scene of the unconditional surrender of german forces in the netherlands , north west germany , including all islands , denmark and all naval ships in those areas to the allies under field marshal bernard montgomery , on 4 may 1945 , at the end of world war ii in europe it is also the area where the body of heinrich himmler , a leading figure in nazi germany and head of the ss , was secretly buried in an unmarked grave following his suicide three motorways ( autobahnen ) run across lüneburg heath , the a 7 , a 27 and a 250 , as well as various federal roads , the b 3 , b 71 , b 440 and others lüneburg heath is served by the following railway lines : the hanover–hamburg railway : hamburg–lüneburg–uelzen–celle–hanover the rollbahn : hamburg–buchholz in der nordheide–rotenburg ( wümme ) –bremen the heath railway ( heidebahn ) : ( hamburg ) –buchholz in der nordheide–soltau–bad fallingbostel–walsrode–bennemühlen–hanover the uelzen–langwedel railway : bremen–visselhövede–soltau–munster–uelzen the brunswick–uelzen railway : uelzen–wieren–wittingen–gifhorn–braunschweig the east hanoverian railways ( osthannoversche eisenbahnen or ohe ) maintains a railway network , the greater part of which lies in the lüneburg heath ( only for goods and museum services ) and sometimes the heath express ( heide-express ) contributing to this are the theme park , heidepark soltau , the walsrode bird park , the serengeti park at hodenhagen , snow dome bispingen , and a center parc as well as the many farms offering holiday stays , making the lüneburg heath especially popular for families
