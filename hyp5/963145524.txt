stamp gum is an item of importance for collectors , although its presence is rarely of use in differentiating between common and rare stamps , and being on the back of the stamp it is not usually visible to thematic collectors if the imprint is related to the occasion of the stamp issue , such as on the 1909 hudson-fulton celebration stamps of the united states some stamps have been issued without any gum at all , either due to a lack of materials , or ( in particular in tropical countries ) to avoid the risk of stamp sheets sticking together the greatest manufacturing problem of the gumming process is its tendency to make the stamps curl , due to the different reaction of paper and gum to varying moisture levels in such cases , stamp catalogs recommend to remove the gum to avoid further damage to the stamps the present work shows how readily bacteria can adhere to the surface of gummed paper which has been slightly moistened ; and the finger is a suitable source both of moisture and of bacterial contamination types of gum ( adhesive ) used on stamps include : dextrin , produced by heating starch gum arabic or acacia gum , derived from the acacia plant glue , from gelatin , rarely seen on stamps polyvinyl alcohol some stamps have had gum applied in a pattern resembling a watermark , presumably as an additional security device on swiss stamps of the 1930s , courvoisier used a gum-breaking machine that pressed a pattern of small squares into the gum , resulting in so-called grilled gum there was an official notice that stated that stamps were going to be prepared with 'hard ' gum , and were intended for use in the summer or humid season to prevent the premature sticking together of the stamps , or the sticking to the paraffin paper when in book form the appearance of the gum varies with the type and method of application , and may range from nearly invisible to dark brown globs on early issues , gum was applied by hand , using a brush or roller , but in 1880 de la rue came up with a machine gumming process using a printing press , and gum is now always applied by machine the episode has been linked anecdotally to an increase in worries about the health risks of licking gummed paper and it has been speculated that it may have contributed to the growing popularity of self-adhesive stamps , at least in the united states in germany in the 1930s and 1940s , had the gum broken by rollers , leading to its serration a 1965 british study of the transmission of bacteria and viruses on gummed paper found that '' although pathogenic bacteria and viruses were not isolated from sample envelopes obtained from various sources , the gums used in manufacture were found to exert a protective effect against death from desiccation on the bacteria and viruses which had been introduced into them '' and it was possible to demonstrate bacterial multiplication in the gum used for the manufacture of postage stamps this relatively new form of stamps has a smooth waxed or polymer-coated release carrier backing to which the pressure-adhesive adhesive of the stamp does not adhere as strongly as on paper the thick gum on some older stamps , namely on issues of austria-hungary , tends to break due to changes in air humidity and temperature due to shortages of material , such as in the situation following world war ii in germany , stamps may be gummed in an economy fashion in 1906 , trouble had constantly arisen due to the gum on the under face of the stamps originally , gumming took place after printing and before perforation , usually because the paper had to be damp for printing to work well , but in modern times most stamp printing is done dry on pre-gummed paper
