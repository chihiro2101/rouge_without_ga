) , madrid , spain when it transferred the assets and liabilities of its former freight transport division as part of the spin-off for the establishment of a new company , deutsche bahn ag acquired all of the company 's shares and is therefore the sole shareholder of db cargo ag otherwise , the supervisory board determines the number and identities of the members of the board of management the current members of the db cargo ag board of management are sigrid evelyn nikutta ( chairwoman ) , ursula biernert ( human resources ) , thorsten dieter ( service ) , ralf günter kloß ( production ) , martina niemann ( finance/controlling ) and pierre timmermans ( sales ) the german company db cargo ag is responsible for both operational services in the field of rail freight transport in germany and central functions such as production , sales , finance and human resources for the entire db cargo group within the scope of the reform , a precursor company was initially established in 1997 to facilitate a transformation of the rail freight transport division structured under public law into a private enterprise company before the company db cargo ag was ultimately founded on 1 january 1999 in 2001 , the danish state-owned rail company danske statsbaner ( dsb ) merged its rail freight transport activities into the joint venture as its third partner and received shares totalling 2 % in railion in return , thus causing the stake of deutsche bahn to decrease to 92 % in 2010 , deutsche bahn joined other rail companies in becoming a partner of the european , represented by its subsidiary db schenker rail ( now db cargo ) the company 's core products particularly include block train and single wagonload transport services , the combination of rail and road , and carbon-neutral transport , for example for audi in 2019 , the german federal ministry of transport and digital infrastructure ( bmvi ) responded to criticism by the bundesrechnungshof regarding the company 's lack of investments by arguing that db cargo and other segments had yet to exhaust their full potential to reflect the company 's focus on its core business activities in the domain of rail freight transport , it was again renamed and designated as db cargo ag in 2016 its corporate purpose covers rail and road services for the transportation of all kinds of goods and the procurement and operation of stationary and mobile means of transport such as locomotive , railcar , wagon and other containers when the competitive environment with other european providers became increasingly tough , deutsche bahn ( db ) and the dutch state-owned rail company nederlanse spoorwegen ( ns ) announced plans to merge their rail freight transport activities in 1998 to progress its developments in this area , db cargo played a leading role in the '' innovative freight wagons '' research project conducted on behalf of the federal ministry of transport and digital infrastructure ( bwvi ) between 2016 and 2019 in 2009 , deutsche bahn abandoned the railion brand and instead chose to consolidate all of its rail freight transport activities under the name db schenker rail the latter is becoming increasingly important given that rail transport currently has the lowest carbon emissions of all carriers and also achieved the largest savings in recent years ( 1995–2015 ) claus weselsky , chairman of the german train drivers ' union ( gdl ) , is another member of the supervisory board , which therefore contains representatives from the two leading trade unions for the rail industry in germany critics accuse deutsche bahn of having neglected the necessary maintenance work on and modernisation of the db cargo infrastructure and claim that the comparably high average age of its locomotives and wagons is a prime example of this problem db cargo , ns cargo and other railion companies subsequently solely focused on freight forwarding while stinnes and schenker took on central tasks in the fields of rail freight transport and sales given that the majority of freight is still transported by road , db cargo has recently attracted more attraction based on the fact that rail freight transport plays an essential role in achieving climate targets during the global outbreak of the novel respiratory disease covid-19 , which hindered cross-border logistics due to limitations in the area of passenger and cargo , the company was able to secure its transport operations successfully
