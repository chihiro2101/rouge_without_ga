kartomi ( 1990 ) on concepts and classifications of musical instruments , chicago : university of chicago press , xix + 329 pp with the invention of hydraulophone , the physics-based organology has been expanded to use solid , liquid , and gas , wherein the top-level category is the state-of-matter of the material that makes the sound one of the most important organologists of the 20th century was curt sachs , who , as well as writing real-lexicon der musikinstrumente ( 1913 ) and the history of musical instruments ( 1940 ) , devised with erich von hornbostel the hornbostel-sachs scheme of instrument classification , which was first published in 1914 in the zeitschrift für ethnologie ( hornbostel–sachs ) johnson states , “ ethnomusicology can… produce a study of the instruments that includes an examination of the interrelationship between the material object , its context and its music , together with an understanding of the meanings connected with each of these areas in specific and general environments ( i.e ivor darreg , microtonal instrument builder leo fender , innovator of several electric guitar constructions ( bridges and electronic configurations ) bart hopkin , founder of experimental musical instruments magazine erich von hornbostel , co-creator of the hornbostel-sachs musical instrument classification system victor-charles mahillon , organologist and museum curator bob moog harry partch , microtonal string division musical theorist curt sachs , musicologist and organologist andre schaeffner leon theremin anthony baines , historical organologist and early authority on bagpipes william waterhouse , author of the new langwill index , a dictionary of musical wind instrument makers and inventors margaret kartomi , professor and chairperson in the department of music at monash university in melbourne , approached the topic of musical instrument classification in 1990 with the intention of understanding how musical instruments are classified across cultures pp.172 sachs ' 1940 book , the history of musical instruments was meant to be a comprehensive compilation of descriptions of instruments from many cultures and their functions within their societies johnson published by the university of oxford , “ the universally used classification system established by musical instruments of hornbostel and sachs has become the paradigm of organology in many cultures ” his syntagma musicum ( 1618 ) is one of the most quoted works from that time on the subject , and is the source of much of what we know about renaissance musical instruments johnson defines four facets of the connection between ethnomusicology and organology- form , context , performance environment , and the interrelationship between instrument , performer and sound object pp.15 the applied branch is the aspects of organology that exist within the realm of museum work that involves the preservation of musical instruments , as well as instrument making pp.4 the word choice in this definition is very intentional- devale avoids the use of the term “ music ” or “ musical ” but rather '' sound '' because the function of some instruments , such as the balinese slit drum , serves to signal an event rather than aid in a musical performance pp.258 in 2012 , eliot bates of cornell university approached the topic of the ethnomusicological study of musical instruments by focusing specifically on what he terms “ the social life of musical instruments ” andre schaeffner introduced a system based on state-of-matter of the sound-producing mechanism , giving rise to two top-level categories : solid ( containing strings and percussion ) , and gas ( containing woodwind and brass ) pp.261 additionally , eliot bates states in a paper published in the journal of the society of ethnomusicology that “ the hornbostel-sachs system was not intended to classify the specificity of unique instruments , but rather to highlight commonalities across the world of instruments explorers returned to europe with instruments from different cultures , however , so that by the end of the 19th century , some musical instrument collections were quite large pp.6 the analytical branch contains the body of work done on analyzing specific aspects of sound instruments and the cultural context/implications of the instruments the first paper in the journal written by sue carole devale entitled “ organizing organology ” attempted to provide a more comprehensive system for defining the study of organology , particularly within the context of ethnomusicology pp.27 devale also emphasizes throughout the paper the importance of the connections which exist between the three branches , as it is often essential to consider aspects of organology within all of three branches when doing work or research of any kind within the field this approach was justified by her observation that the concepts upon which an outside european researcher might classify musical instruments of a particular culture are likely different from the way that those native to the culture choose to classify their musical instruments the first major documents on the subjects from the west , however , date from the 16th century , with works such as sebastian virdung 's musica getuscht und ausgezogen ( 1511 ) , and martin agricola 's musica instrumentalis deudsch ( 1529 ) a number of ancient cultures left documents detailing the musical instruments used and their role in society ; these documents sometimes included a classification system this paper sought to demonstrate the contribution that the field of ethnomusicology can make to the study of musical instruments
