the origins of the company go back to 1905 with the establishment in varel ( near bremen ) of hansa ( company ) and the foundation in bremen itself of namag , maker of the lloyd car the first '' automobile '' carl borgward designed was the 1924 blitzkarren ( lightning cart ) , a tiny three-wheeled van with , which was an enormous success in the market gap it filled after world war ii , in 1946 carl borgward used some of the brand names from businesses he had acquired over the years to found three separate companies : borgward , goliath and lloyd for many purposes the companies would be run as a single entity ; but in a business operated by a man to whom delegation did not come naturally , the proliferation of legal entities nevertheless added unhelpful layers of complexity through the 1950s and encouraged a broadening of the range which in the end proved financially unsustainable with the sales volumes achievable borgward introduced a line of 1500 & nbsp ; cc sports racers in the 1950s , with the 16-valve engine from these becoming a successful formula two power unit ( which was also used by some f1 privateers in 1961 ) the widest range of cars from any manufacturer in germany , produced by three till recently operationally autonomous companies ( borgward , goliath and lloyd ) was supporting a turnover of only 650 million marks , placing the overall sales value from the combined borgward auto businesses only in fifth position among germany 's auto-makers the 70-year-old carl borgward 's '' hands-on '' insistence on an increasingly manic proliferation of new and modified models featuring adventurous , but under-developed technological innovations ( fast manische konstruierwut ) gave rise to components which too often did not work , broke down or fell apart , resulting in massive bills for pre-delivery remediation and/or post delivery warranty work that found their way back to the company capital intensive businesses such as auto manufacturing use their expensive machines and tools most efficiently if they use them constantly at full capacity , but the car market in europe in the 1950s/60s was more seasonal than today , with sales diminishing in winter , then peaking in the early summer months : borgward 's inventory of unsold cars at the end of 1960 was higher than usual , reflecting ambitious growth plans , most obviously in respect of the united states market the december 1960 der spiegel article speculated that of the 15,000 borgward cars ordered by the north american dealers in 1960 ( and of the 12,000 delivered to them ) 6,000 might have to be taken back following a slump in north american demand '' ) at the end of december 1960 borgward approached the bank for a further one million marks of credit , the loan to be backed by a guarantee from the bremen ( state ) government which initially the bremen senators agreed to provide despite his hamburg origins , semler was by this time based in munich , with a network of contacts in the bavarian establishment that probably included fellow csu politician and the future german chancellor , ludwig erhard , who in 1948 had succeeded semler in a top administrative position within the bizone the appointment of johannes semler as the representative of the bremen senators to chair the borgward supervisory board would , in retrospect , contribute to the controversy that followed the borgward bankruptcy on 28 july 1961 , semler , as chairman of the supervisory board , joined the directors of the three companies borgward , goliath and lloyd to instigate proceedings for the establishment of a “ vergleichsverfahren ” , which would have provided for a court sanctioned administration ( law ) enabling the business to continue to trade while at the same time protecting the interests of creditors two months later , however , in september 1961 , the borgward and goliath businesses were declared bankrupt , followed in november by the lloyd business in the light of what was known at the time , and increasingly in the light of subsequent events , the argument that the business was not really insolvent at all has , if anything , gained support nevertheless , evaluation of the issues requires informed and careful judgement , and the opposite case can also be made , that had the company continued trading beyond 1961 there was no reasonable prospect that it would generate sufficient cash to repay existing debts within a contractually established or reasonable period nor , indeed , to repay all necessary subsequently incurred financing and other business debts in fact , the appointment of semler to the bmw board was one of several events which , in rapid succession , marked an improvement in the fortunes of bmw those who contend that semler 's role in the borgward bankruptcy was part of a conspiracy orchestrated on behalf of bmw to bring down borgward point out that the “ niche ” allegedly defined by the mid-weight bmws from 1961 bore an uncanny resemblance to the niche previously occupied by the borgward isabella during the 1950s in a period of boom there was little doubt that the affected workers would have found job opportunities with other german automakers , but they would have needed to relocate away from bremen , and the spiegel 's description of carl borgward 's implementation of the redundancies savagely implied a singular absence of human sensitivity in addition to various commercial vehicles , the 1961 passenger car range included the lloyd 600 , the lloyd arabella , the goliath 1100 ( rebadged in 1959 as the borgward 1100 ) , the borgward isabella and the borgward p100 the german magazine der spiegel published a thoughtful piece in 1966 , implying that with a little more support , and if the proprietor had been more willing to take advice from his own directors , the borgward company could have easily overcome its financial problems of 1961 the production of borgward isabella was carried out in cordoba city , by using argentine engines , local components ( glass , batteries , tires ) and other pieces from germany when the german parent company closed its doors in 1961 , the operation happened to have local control , and continued for a short time to complete the total manufacture of 1,050 cars during its short life in argentine territory as part of the bankruptcy process , in 1963 , all manufacturing equipment for the borgward isabella and p100 was sold to a buyer in monterrey , mexico borgward 2000 borgward 2300 lloyd arabella borgward hansa 1500 borgward hansa 1500 borgward hansa 1500 borgward
