by late 1836 , many recent latter day saint converts had gathered in missouri and kirtland , ohio the city of kirtland experienced a significant population increase , growing from approximately 1,000 people in 1830 to 3,000 in 1836 , with a similar increase in surrounding agricultural areas after some discussion by the leadership of the church , church apostle orson hyde went to the ohio legislature to request a bank charter while oliver cowdery went to philadelphia and acquired plates to print notes for the proposed kirtland safety society bank hyde returned to the ohio legislature in february with a petition , joined by several non-mormons , for a bank based on far less capital stock grandison newell , a professed antagonist to the latter day saints in general and its president in particular , instigated several lawsuits against the mormons in ohio due to their influence , the legislature refused all applications for bank charters but one during 1836 and 1837 , in part because of endemic nationwide problems with land speculation , wildcat banking and counterfeiting under the advice of non-mormon legal counsel , the kirtland safety society anti-banking company ( kssabc ) was formed under revised articles on january 2 , 1837 as a joint stock company to serve as a quasi-banking institution the proposed capitalization of the '' anti-bank '' greatly exceeded the resources that were available from its backers , as noted by historian , robert kent fielding : as it was projected , there was never the slightest chance that the kirtland safety society anti-bank-ing company could succeed even though their economy was in jeopardy , it could scarcely have suffered such a devastating blow as that which they were themselves preparing to administer to it its organizers launched , instead , a gigantic company capitalized at four million dollars , when the entire capitalization of all the banks in the state of ohio was only nine and one third million according to the articles of incorporation capital stock was to be paid in by subscription but that the amount of payments were left to the discretion of the company managers the kss failure , although unique in some ways , was part of a national bank crisis known as the panic of 1837 that began in may of that year the economic policies of the previous president andrew jackson , including the specie circular and the withdrawal of government funds from the second bank of the united states , also contributed to the crisis on may 10 , 1837 in new york , every chartered bank stopped payment in specie ( gold and silver coinage ) , leaving banks and local institutions like the kss holding notes without adequate liquid assets '' out of eight hundred and fifty banks in the united states , three hundred and forty-three closed entirely , sixty-two failed partially , and the system of state banks received a shock from which it never fully recovered smith appointed granger as his agent to clear up his kirtland affairs , as smith was named in seventeen lawsuits with claims totalling 30,206.44 over debts incurred in the failure of the kssabc according to lds church scholars , '' four of these suits were settled ; three were voluntarily discontinued by the plaintiffs ; and ten resulted in judgments against joseph smith and others after parrish started to stir up the latter day saint community , many church members ( including church leaders ) became disillusioned with the failure of the kssabc and left the church or were disfellowshipped or excommunicated shortly after his resignation from the kssabc in july he stated in the august 1837 messenger and advocate : i am disposed to say a word relative to the bills of the kirtland safety society bank i hereby warn them to beware of speculators , renegadoes defectors and gamblers , who are duping the unsuspecting and the unwary , by palming upon them , those bills , which are of no worth , here joseph smith , '' caution , '' latter day saints ' messenger and advocate 3/11 ( august 1837 ) , 560 on january 12 , 1838 , faced with a warrant for his arrest on a charge of illegal banking , smith fled with rigdon to clay county , missouri just ahead of an armed group out to capture and hold smith for trial according to smith , they left '' to escape mob violence , which was about to burst upon us under the color of legal process to cover the hellish designs of our enemies a kirtland safety society note bearing joseph smith 's signature can be quite valuable ; for example , in an auction in march 2006 , a 100 note sold for 11,500 ( about a 3 % per year gain )
