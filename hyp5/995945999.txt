this issue raises a number of extremely important questions around the validity of sweden 's accession to the eu ( on the basis of the 1994 referendum which was held using the earlier system as described above ) and , indeed , the validity of the eu itself , which not only allowed the accession of a state with serious deficiencies in its electoral system which blatantly transgressed the echr but also failed to address these deficiencies until a private citizen made a complaint almost 20 years later to vote in a swedish general election , one must be : swedish election authority , '' suffrage and electoral rolls '' a swedish citizen , at least 18 years of age on election day , and have at some point been a registered resident of sweden ( thus excluding foreign-born swedes who have never lived in sweden ) to vote in swedish local elections ( for the county councils and municipal assemblies ) , one must : be a registered resident of the county or municipality in question and be at least 18 years of age on election day fall into one of the following groups : swedish citizens citizens of iceland , norway , or any country in the european union citizens of any other country who have permanent residency in sweden and have lived in sweden for three consecutive years in order to vote in elections to the european parliament , one must be 18 years old , and fall into one of the following groups : swedish citizens who are or have been residents of sweden citizens of any other country in the european union who are currently residents of sweden ; such citizens , by choosing to vote in european parliamentary elections in sweden , become ineligible to vote in european parliamentary elections in any other eu member state in general , any person who is eligible to vote is also eligible to stand for election elections to the european parliament occur every five years in may or june throughout the entire european union ; the exact day of the election varies by country according to the local tradition , thus in sweden they happen on a sunday the ballot papers must be identical in size and material , and have different colors depending on the type of election : yellow for riksdag elections , blue for county council elections and white for municipal elections and elections to the european parliament earlier swedish election policy of always displaying the ballot papers for voters to select in public , making it impossible for many voters to vote secretly , has been criticised as undemocratic and is arguably in blatant contravention of protocol 1 , article 3 of the european convention on human rights ( echr ) which clearly stipulates that elections must be free and by secret ballot in riksdag elections , constituencies are usually coterminous with one of the swedish counties , though the counties of stockholm , skåne ( containing malmö ) , and västra götaland ( containing gothenburg ) are divided into smaller electoral constituencies due to their larger populations as mandated by swedish law , nine out of ten seats on each county council are permanent seats from a particular constituency ; the remaining seats are at-large adjustment seats , used to ensure county-wide proportionality with the vote , just as with general elections the remaining 39 seats in the riksdag are '' leveling seats , '' distributed amongst the parties in numbers that will ensure that the party distribution in the riksdag matches the distribution of the votes nationally ( in the previous election ) as closely as possible in national general elections , any candidates who receive a number of personal votes equal to eight percent or greater of the party 's total number of votes will automatically be bumped to the top of the list , regardless of their ranking on the list by the party in order to win seats in the riksdag , a party must win at least four percent of the vote nationally , or twelve percent of the vote in any electoral constituency for municipal elections , since the elections of 2018 there has been a minimum threshold of two percent in municipalities with only one constituency , and three percent in those with more than one because seats are allocated primarily to the parties and not candidates , the seat of an mp who resigns during their term in office can be taken by a replacement runner-up candidate from their own party ( unlike systems such as the united kingdom , a by-election is not triggered ) elections to sweden 's county councils occur simultaneously with the general elections on the second sunday of september
