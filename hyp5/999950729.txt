and john france , '' the election and title of godfrey de bouillon '' , canadian journal of history , 18:3 ( 1983 ) , 321–29 much of the evidence for this comes from william of tyre , whose account of these events is troublesome ; it is only william who tells us that dagobert forced godfrey to concede jerusalem and jaffa , while other writers such as albert of aix and ralph of caen suggest that both dagobert and his ally tancred had sworn an oath to godfrey to accept only one of his brothers or blood relations as his successor in reality , godfrey was only one of several leaders of the crusade , which also included raymond iv of toulouse , bohemond of taranto , robert of flanders , stephen of blois and baldwin of boulogne to name a few , along with papal legate adhemar of le puy , bishop of le puy , '' the army of godfrey of bouillon , 1096–1099 : structure and dynamics of a contingent on the first crusade '' ( pdf ) , revue belge de philologie et d'histoire 70 ( 2 ) , 1992 '' godfrey of bouillon '' , encyclopadeia britannica ( 11th edition ) , cambridge university press , cambridge , 1910 , volume 12 , pg it was an end to three years of fighting by the crusaders , but they had finally achieved what they had set out to do in 1096—to recapture the holy land and , in particular , the city of jerusalem and its holy sites , such as the holy sepulchre , the empty tomb of jesus although it is widely claimed that he took the title advocatus sancti sepulchri ( '' advocate '' or '' defender '' of the holy sepulchre ) , this title is only used in a letter which was not written by godfrey as was typical of godfrey 's christian ethics , he refused to be crowned king '' upon the plea that he would never wear a crown of gold where his saviour had worn a crown of thorns '' 25-26 ) followed earlier writers in suggesting that since the names godfrey and geoffrey shared a common origin , godfrey is identical to the geoffrey of boulogne who appears in english records , marrying beatrice , daughter of geoffrey de mandeville and that he left behind in england a son , william de boulogne ( adult by 1106 , died c godfrey of bouillon was born around 1060 as the second son of eustace ii , count of boulogne , and ida , daughter of the lotharingian duke godfrey the bearded and his first wife , doda godfrey , along with his two brothers , started in august 1096 at the head of an army from lorraine ( some say 40,000 strong ) along '' charlemagne 's road '' , as urban ii seems to have called it ( according to the chronicler robert the monk ) —the road to jerusalem natasha hodgson 'lions , tigers and bears : encounters with wild animals and bestial imagery in the context of crusading to the latin east ' viator ( 2013 ) in 1098 , godfrey took part in the siege of antioch , which fell in june of that year after long and bitter fighting he was depicted as the leader of the crusades , the king of jerusalem , and the legislator who laid down the assizes of jerusalem , and he was included among the ideal knights known as the nine worthies pierre desrey 's genealogie de godefroi de buillon , completed in 1499 , gives a complete history of the crusades , starting with the birth of the chevalier au cygne ( knight of the swan ) , the ancestor of godfrey , and ending after the accession of philip iv of france ( 1268–1314 ) in 1076 he had succeeded as designated heir to the lotharingian lands of his uncle , godfrey the hunchback , and godfrey was struggling to maintain control over the lands that henry iv had not taken away from him being at haifa at the time of godfrey 's death , he could do nothing to stop godfrey 's supporters , led by warner of grez , from seizing jerusalem and demanding that godfrey 's brother baldwin should succeed to the rule however his maternal uncle , godfrey the hunchback , died childless and named his nephew , godfrey of bouillon , as his heir and next in line to his duchy of lower lorraine most of the foot soldiers wanted to continue south to jerusalem , but raymond iv of toulouse , by this time the most powerful of the princes , having taken others into his employ , such as tancred , hesitated to continue the march before that time , he helped to relieve the vanguard at the battle of dorylaeum after it had been pinned down by the seljuk turks under kilij arslan i , with the help of the other crusader princes in the main force and went on to sack the seljuk camp however , his impressive victory in 1099 and his subsequent campaigning in 1100 meant that he was able to force akko , ascalon , arsuf , jaffa , and caesarea to become tributaries however , alan murray analyzed the argument in detail and concluded that contemporary documents clearly distinguish between the two names , and as there is no evidence for their identity and traditions of the crusade indicate godfrey was unmarried and childless , the two must be considered to have been distinct '' while he was besieging the city of acre , godfrey , the ruler of jerusalem , was struck by an arrow , which killed him '' , reports the arab chronicler ibn al-qalanisi bohemond decided to remain behind in order to secure his new principality ; and godfrey 's younger brother , baldwin , also decided to stay in the north in the crusader state he had established at edessa according to william of tyre , the later 12th-century chronicler of the kingdom of jerusalem , godfrey was '' tall of stature , not extremely so , but still taller than the average man in this he was joined by his older brother , eustace , and his younger brother , baldwin , who had no lands in europe during his short reign , godfrey had to defend the new kingdom of jerusalem against fatimids of egypt , who were defeated at the battle of ascalon in august godfrey was believed to have possessed immense physical strength ; it was said that in cilicia he wrestled a bear and won , and that he once beheaded a camel with one blow of his sword solomon bar simson asserted that godfrey claimed he had never intended to harm jews , but the jews in mainz and cologne each gave him a bribe of 500 silver marks , and godfrey '' assured them of his support and promised them peace '' '' after being notified of godfrey 's pledge by a messenger from kalonymus ben meshullam ( the jewish leader in mainz ) , emperor henry iv issued an order prohibiting any harm to the jewish communities in the paradiso segment of his divine comedy , dante alighieri sees the spirit of godfrey , together with roland 's , in the heaven of mars with the other '' warriors of the faith '' in the people 's crusade , beginning in the spring and early summer of 1096 , bands of peasants and low-ranking knights set off early for jerusalem on their own , and persecuted jews during the rhineland massacres
