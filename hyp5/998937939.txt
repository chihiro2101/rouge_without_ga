plesetsk cosmodrome was originally developed by the soviet union as a launch site for intercontinental ballistic missiles under the leadership and supervision of lieutenant general galaktion alpaidze the first soviet combat formation of intercontinental ballistic missiles r-7 of general designer sergei korolev had to be located in that place , in thick northern taiga to the south of arkhangelsk in january 1963 , a joint decision of the central committee of the communist party of the soviet union and the ussr council of ministers created the '' research proving ground missile and space weapons ussr ministry of defense '' near the ilez railway station , belsky district of arkhangelsk oblast in the summer of 1963 , the leadership of the state is decided on the use of launch facilities in plesetsk for launching spacecraft by 1997 , more than 1,500 launches to space had been made from the site , more than for any other launch facility , although the usage has declined significantly since the break-up of the soviet union because plesetsk was used primarily for military launches , especially zenit photoreconnaissance satellites , which were launched in large numbers during the 1970s-80s , the ussr did not admit to its existence , but it was discovered by british physics teacher geoffrey perry and his students at kettering grammar school , who carefully analysed the orbit of the kosmos 112 satellite in 1966 and deduced it had not been launched from baikonur cosmodrome after the end of the cold war , it was learned that the cia had begun to suspect the existence of an icbm launch site at plesetsk in the late 1950s the use of the cosmodrome will likely increase in the future since there are concerns with security in operating the baikonur cosmodrome in now-independent kazakhstan , which also demands rent for its continued use in may 2007 , a new icbm , called the rs-24 has been tested and launched there , and is seen as eventually replacing the aging rs-18/ur-100ns ( ss-19 stiletto ) and rs-20/r-36ms ( ss-18 satan ) that are the backbone of russia 's missile forces
