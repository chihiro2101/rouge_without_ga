this required some form of '' distributed arbitration '' to allow the various cards to gain access to the bus at any point , as opposed to vme , which put a single master in slot 0 with overall control it took another four years for the futurebus+ standard to be released by this time custom variation of futurebus took the lead in industry another problem that needed to be addressed was the ability to have several cards in the system as '' masters '' , allowing futurebus to build multiprocessor machines in order to do this the primary technology of futurebus was built using asynchronous links , allowing the devices plugged into it to talk at whatever speed they wished it was quite reasonable to connect a cpu and ram to vme on separate cards to build a computer to understand futurebus+ you need to read many ieee standards : 896.1-1991 ieee standard for futurebus+ — logical protocol specification 896.2-1991 ieee standard backplane bus specification for multiprocessor architectures : futurebus+ 896.3-1993 ieee recommended practice for futurebus+ 896.4-1993 ieee standard for conformance test requirements for futurebus+ 896.5-1993 ieee standard for futurebus+ , profile m ( military ) 896.6 futurebus+ telecommunications systems , profile t ( telecommunications ) 896.7 interconnect between futurebus+ systems 896.8 small computer expandibility module for futurebus+ systems , profile d ( desktop ) 896.9-1994 fault tolerant extensions to the futurebus+ architecture 896.10-1997 standard for futurebus+ spaceborne systems - profile s 896.11 standard for ieee 1355 links on futurebus+ backplane connector 896.12 standard for fault tolerance classification of computer-based systems 1194.1-1991 ieee standard for electrical characteristics of backplane transceiver logic ( btl ) interface circuits 1301 standard for metric equipment practice for microcomputers - coordination document 1301.1-1991 ieee standard for a metric equipment practice for microcomputers—convection-cooled with 2 & nbsp ; mm connectors 1156.1 standard microprocessor environmental specifications for computer modules eia is-64 ( 1991 ) 2 & nbsp ; mm two-part connectors for use with printed boards and backplanes 896.2 contains three profiles for target markets , a for general purpose systems , b for an i/o bus , and f for a futurebus+ will all the options that will make it go fast typical ieee standards start with a company building a device , and then submitting it to the ieee for the standardization effort meanwhile , the vme ecosystem had evolved to such a degree that it continues to be used today , another decade on that was just in time for the us navy who had been looking for a new high-speed system for the next generation computer resources ( ngcr ) project for passing sonar data around in their newly designed seawolf-class submarine , and they said they would standardize on futurebus if only a few more changes would be made futurebus is described in just a few ieee standards : 896.1-1987 ieee standard backplane bus specifications for multiprocessor architectures : futurebus 1101-1987 ieee standard for mechanical core specifications for microcomputers using iec 603-2 connectors futurebus systems were implemented with 9ux280 eurocard mechanics using 96-pin din connectors resulting in a backplane that supported both 16 and 32 bit bus widths in the case of futurebus this was reversed , the whole system was being designed during the standardization effort
