the flowers are formed from five petals ; four are upswept or fan-shaped with two per side , and there is one , broad , lobed lower petal pointing downward the shape of the petals and placement defines many species , for example , some species have a '' spur '' on the end of each petal while most have a spur on the lower petal the corolla ranges from white to yellow , orange or various shades of blue and violet or multicolored , often blue and yellow , with or without a yellow throat the nutlike seeds , which are obovoid to globose , are typically arillate ( with a specialized outgrowth ) and have straight embryos , flat cotyledons , and soft fleshy endosperm that is oily one characteristic of some viola is the elusive scent of their flowers ; along with terpenes , a major component of the scent is a ketone compound called ionone , which temporarily desensitizes the receptors of the nose , thus preventing any further scent being detected from the flower until the nerves recover however , in 1802 batsch had already established a separate family , which he called violariae based on viola as the type genus , with seven other genera although violariae continued to be used by some authors , such as bentham and hooker in 1862 ( as violarieae ) , most authors adopted the alternative name violaceae , first proposed by de lamarck and de candolle in 1805 , and gingins ( 1823 ) and saint-hilaire ( 1824 ) viola is one of about 25 genera and about 600 species in the large family eudicot family violaceae , divided into subfamilies and tribes while most genera are monotypic , viola is a very large genus , variously circumscribed as having between 500 and 600 species molecular phylogenetic studies show that viola occurs in clade i of the family , as viola , schweiggeria , noisettia and allexis , in which schweiggeria and noisettia are monotypic and form a sister group to viola however , the exact phylogenetic relationships remain unresolved , as a consequence many different taxonomic nomenclatures are in use , including groupings referred to as grex place the five s american sections , andinium , leptidium , tridens , rubellium and chilenium at the base of the phylogenetic tree , in that order these are followed by the single australian section , erpetion , as sister group to chilenium , the northern hemisphere sections and finally the single african section , v the genus includes dog violets , a group of scentless species which are the most common viola in many areas , sweet violet ( viola odorata ) ( named from its sweet scent ) , and many other species whose common name includes the word '' violet ''
