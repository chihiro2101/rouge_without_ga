in lapping the dust is removed to create a flat sheet or lap of fibres ; carding itself is the combing of the tangled lap into a thick rope or sliver of 1/2 inch in diameter , it can then be optionally combed , is used to remove the shorter fibres , creating a stronger yarn a fine web of more or less parallel fibre , a few fibres thick and as wide as the carder 's rollers , exits the carder at the fly comb by gravity or other mechanical means for storage or further processing . with woollen , two carding machines were used : the first or the scribbler opened and mixed the fibres , the second or the condenser mixed and formed the web these carders do not store fibre in the card cloth as the drum carder does but , rather , fibre passes through the workings of the carder for storage or for additional processing by other machines intermediate frames are used to repeat the slubbing process to produce a finer yarn , and then the roving frames reduces it to a finer thread , gives more twist , makes more regular and even in thickness , and winds onto a smaller tube the fancy 's card cloth is designed to engage with the swift 's card cloth so that the fibres are lifted to the tips of the swift 's card cloth and carried by the swift to the doffer as the swift carries the fibres forward , from the nippers , those fibres that are not yet straightened are picked up by a worker and carried over the top to its paired stripper the shape , length , diameter , and spacing of these wire pins are dictated by the card designer and the particular requirements of the application where the card cloth will be used these ordered fibres can then be passed on to other processes that are specific to the desired end use of the fibre : cotton , batting , felt , woollen or worsted yarn , etc the combination of these two inventions became the standard for the carding industry , using machines first built by parr , curtis and walton in ancoats , and from 1857 by jams walton & sons at haughton dale '' in the grease '' means that the lanolin that naturally comes with the wool has not been washed out , leaving the wool with a slightly greasy feel in-feed to the carder is usually accomplished by hand or by conveyor belt and often the output of the cottage carder is stored as a batt or further processed into roving and wound into bumps with an accessory bump winder a pair of cards is used to brush the wool between them until the fibres are more or less aligned in the same direction this attachment serves to condense the fibres already in the card cloth and adds a small amount of additional straightening to the condensed fibre small cards , called flick cards , are used to flick the ends of a lock of fibre , or to tease out some strands for spinning off the two rollers are connected to each other by a belt- or chain-drive so that their relative speeds cause the storage drum to gently pull fibres from the licker-in by 1838 , the river spen , centred on cleckheaton had at least 11 card clothing factories and by 1893 , it was generally accepted as the card cloth capital of the world , though by 2008 only two manufacturers of metallic and flexible card clothing remained in england , garnett wire ltd at the turn of the eighteenth century , wool in england was being carded using pairs of hand cards , in a two-stage process : 'working ' with the cards opposed and 'stripping ' where they are in parallel from the 1780s , the carding machines were set up in mills in the north of england and mid-wales
