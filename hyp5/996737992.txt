because of the large amount of energy already stored in the gain medium , the intensity of light in the laser resonator builds up very quickly ; this also causes the energy stored in the medium to be depleted almost as quickly the net result is a short pulse of light output from the laser , known as a giant pulse , which may have a very high peak intensity this may be a mechanical device such as a shutter , chopper wheel , or spinning mirror/prism placed inside the cavity , or ( more commonly ) it may be some form of modulator such as an acousto-optic device , a magneto-optic effect device or an electro-optic device â€” a pockels cell or kerr cell the material may be an ion-doped crystal like cr-yag , which is used for q-switching of nd-yag laser , a bleachable dye , or a passive semiconductor device jitter can be reduced by not reducing the q by as much , so that a small amount of light can still circulate in the cavity electro-optic modulators are normally used for this , since they can easily be made to function as a near-perfect beam '' switch '' to couple the beam out of the cavity the modulator that dumps the beam may be the same modulator that q-switches the cavity , or a second ( possibly identical ) modulator a dumped cavity is more complicated to align than simple q-switching , and may need a control loop to choose the best time at which to dump the beam from the cavity pulses of light from another laser ( the '' master oscillator '' ) are injected into the cavity by lowering the q to allow the pulse to enter and then increasing the q to confine the pulse to the cavity where it can be amplified by repeated passes through the gain medium large-scale laser systems can produce q-switched pulses with energies of many joules and peak powers in the gigawatt region on the other hand , passively q-switched microchip lasers ( with very short resonators ) have generated pulses with durations far below one nanosecond and pulse repetition rates from hundreds of hertz to several megahertz ( mhz ) q-switched lasers are often used in applications which demand high laser intensities in nanosecond pulses , such as metal cutting or pulsed holography however , q-switched lasers can also be used for measurement purposes , such as for distance measurements ( range finding ) by measuring the time it takes for the pulse to get to some target and the reflected light to get back to the sender
