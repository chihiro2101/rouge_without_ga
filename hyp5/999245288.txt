the enteric nervous system in humans consists of some 500 million neurons ; alternate source at website : ( including the various types of dogiel cells ) , 0.5 % of the number of neurons in the brain , five times as many as the one hundred million neurons in the human spinal cord , and about as many as in the whole nervous system of a cat the enteric nervous system is embedded in the lining of the gastrointestinal system , beginning in the esophagus and extending down to the anus auerbach 's plexus , also known as the myenteric plexus , is a collection of unmyelinated fibers and postganglionic autonomic cell bodies that lie between the circular and longitudinal layers of the muscularis externa in the gastrointestinal tract the plexus is the parasympathetic nucleus of origin for the vagus nerve , and communicate with the medulla oblongata through both the anterior and posterior vagal nerves the ens is capable of autonomous functions like the coordination of reflexes ; although it receives considerable innervation from the autonomic nervous system , it can and does operate independently of the brain and the spinal cord in vertebrates , the enteric nervous system includes efferent neurons , afferent neurons , and interneurons , all of which make the enteric nervous system capable of carrying reflexes and acting as an integrating center in the absence of cns input the enteric nervous system also makes use of more than 30 & nbsp ; neurotransmitters , most of which are identical to the ones found in cns , such as acetylcholine , dopamine , and serotonin in addition , ens contains support cells which are similar to astroglia of the brain and a diffusion barrier around the capillaries surrounding ganglia which is similar to the bloodâ€“brain barrier of cerebrum blood vessels working on the small intestines of dogs , they found that the response of increasing the pressure in the intestine caused the contraction of the muscle wall above the point of stimulation and the relaxation of the muscle wall below the point of stimulation hormone secretion is controlled by the vagovagal reflex , where the neurons in the digestive tract communicate through both afferent and efferent pathways with the vagus nerve specifically , neurogastroenterology focuses on the functions , malfunctions , and the malformations of the sympathetic , parasympathetic , and enteric divisions of the digestive tract
