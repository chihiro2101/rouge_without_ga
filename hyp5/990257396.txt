the first wave of follow-up bombers dropped high explosive bombs , the intent of which was to knock out the utilities ( the water supply , electricity network and gas mains ) , and to crater the road — making it difficult for the fire engines to reach fires started by the successive waves of bombers two particularly notable raids were the coventry blitz on 14 november 1940 , and the blitz on london on the night of 29 december/30 december 1940 , which was the most destructive raid on london during the war with much of the destruction caused by fires started by incendiary bombs lemay , usaf bombing of hamburg in world war ii bombing of dresden in world war ii bombing of london in world war ii coventry blitz bombing of tokyo in world war ii bombing of frampol in world war ii bombing of wieluń in world war ii bombing of warsaw in world war ii aerial bombing of cities roerich pact as sir arthur harris , commander of raf bomber command , wrote after the war : the military tactics of the bomber stream was developed by the raf to overwhelm the german aerial defenses of the kammhuber line during world war ii to increase the raf 's concentration in time over the target page 118 these were : the use of pathfinder aircraft with electronic aids to navigate , to mark the targets before the main bomber raid ; and the use of high explosive bombs and air-mines coupled with thousands of incendiary bombs intended to set the city ablaze changing to low-altitude night tactics to concentrate the fire damage while minimizing the effectiveness of fighter and artillery defenses , the operation meetinghouse raid carried out by 279 b-29s raided tokyo again on the night of 9/10 march , dropped 1,665 tons of incendiaries from altitudes of , mostly using the e-46 cluster bomb which released 38 m-69 incendiary cluster bomb at an altitude of the high-explosive bombs and the larger air-mines were not only designed to hamper the coventry fire brigade , they were also intended to damage roofs , making it easier for the incendiary bombs to fall into buildings and ignite them but after the lessons learned during the blitz , the tactic of dropping a high concentration of bombs over the target in the shortest time possible became standard in the raf as it was more effective than a longer raid
