mcmillan was also involved with the implosion as the head of the g-3 group within the g ( gadget ) division , which was responsible for obtaining measurements and timings on implosion , and served as the laboratory 's liaison with project camel , the aerial test program being carried out by caltech audio lecture by edwin mcmillan at los alamos national laboratory voices of the manhattan project audio lecture by elsie mcmillan at los alamos national laboratory voices of the manhattan project mcmillan 's nobel lecture : the transuranium elements : early history including the nobel lecture on december 12 , 1951 the transuranium elements : early history he served on the influential general advisory committee ( gac ) of the atomic energy commission from 1954 to 1958 , and the commission on high energy physics of the international union of pure and applied physics from 1960 to 1967 this proved to be far more difficult that doing so with radar , because of objects in the water and variations in water temperature that caused variations in the speed of sound the plutonium gun , codenamed thin man , needed a muzzle velocity of at least per second , which they hoped to achieve with a modified navy 3 '' /50 caliber gun in november he accompanied oppenheimer on a trip to new mexico on which the los alamos ranch school was selected as the site of the project 's weapons research laboratory , which became the los alamos laboratory '' the transuranium elements : early history ( nobel lecture ) '' , university of california radiation laboratory , lawrence berkeley national laboratory , united states department of energy ( through predecessor agency the atomic energy commission ) , ( december 12 , 1951 ) kistiakowsky joined the laboratory on february 16 , 1944 , and parsons 's e ( explosives ) division was divided in two , with mcmillan as deputy for the gun and kistiakowsky as deputy for implosion after his retirement from the faculty at berkeley in 1974 , he spent 1974â€“75 at cern , where he worked on the g minus 2 experiment to measure the magnetic moment of the muon flying over the naval submarine base new london with luis walter alvarez and air chief marshal hugh dowding , they showed that the radar was able to detect the conning tower of a partly submerged submarine his gold nobel prize medal is in the national museum of american history , a division of the smithsonian , in washington dc '' a thick target for synchrotrons and betatrons '' , university of california radiation laboratory , lawrence berkeley national laboratory , united states department of energy ( through predecessor agency the atomic energy commission ) , ( september 19 , 1950 ) in november 1940 , he began working at the mit radiation laboratory in cambridge , massachusetts , where he participated in the development and testing of airborne microwave radar during world war ii he dubbed this the '' phase stability principle '' , and the new design a '' synchrotron ''
