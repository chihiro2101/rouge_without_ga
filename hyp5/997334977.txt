buridan was born sometime before 1301 , perhaps at or near the town of béthune in picardy , france , zupko 2015 , §1 or perhaps elsewhere in the diocese of arras he received his education in paris , first at the collège du cardinal lemoine and then at the university of paris , receiving his master of arts degree and formal license to teach at the latter by the mid-1320s unusually , he spent his entire academic life in the faculty of arts , rather than obtaining the doctorate in law , medicine or theology that typically prepared the way for a career in philosophy indeed , he is listed in a document from 1350 as being among the teachers capable of supporting themselves without the need for financial assistance from the university zupko has speculated that buridan '' deliberately chose to remain among the 'artists artistae ' , '' possibly envisioning philosophy as a secular enterprise based on what is evident to both the senses and the intellect , rather than the non-evident truths of theology revealed through scripture and doctrine the last appearance of buridan in historical documents came in 1359 , where he was mentioned as the adjudicator in a territorial dispute between the england and picard nations thus , in the aristotelian view , a projectile moving through the air would owe its continuing motion to eddies or vibrations in the surrounding medium , a phenomenon known as antiperistasis zupko 1997 the major difference between buridan 's theory and that of his predecessor is that he rejected the view that the impetus dissipated spontaneously , instead asserting that a body would be arrested by the forces of air resistance and gravity which might be opposing its impetus after leaving the arm of the thrower , the projectile would be moved by an impetus given to it by the thrower and would continue to be moved as long as the impetus remained stronger than the resistance , and would be of infinite duration were it not diminished and corrupted by a contrary force resisting it or by something inclining it to a contrary motion ( questions on aristotle 's metaphysics xii.9 : 73ra ) because of his developments , historians of science pierre duhem and anneliese maier both saw buridan as playing an important role in the demise of on the heavens duhem 1906–13 zupko has disagreed , pointing out that buridan did not use his theory to transform the science of mechanics , but instead remained a committed aristotelian in thinking that motion and rest are contrary states and that the universe is finite in extent john buridan 's philosophy of mind : an edition and translation of book iii of his questions on aristotle 's de anima ( third redaction ) , with commentary and critical and interpretative essays the treatise on consequences and other writings a summary of the other logical writings buridan : editions , translations and studies on the manuscript tradition complete bibliography of the logical and metaphysical works
