the rgl would have been the first system in the netherlands where light rail vehicles shared heavy rail tracks with heavy rail trains , similar to the tram-train systems around karlsruhe and saarbrücken , germany with the route through the hooigracht/langegracht in leiden decided ( 2008 ) , and the decision of the provincial government on the western route , the future of the rgl was a little clearer , but that did not mean that all obstacles have been overcome in march 2003 test traffic was started between gouda and alphen aan den rijn with light rail equipment on existing rail tracks , largely using rgl vehicles in 2005 , an agreement was signed between all municipalities except the municipality of leiden to share the costs of the project , with the national government and province covering a large part of the construction cost , and the county bearing all risks for the operation of the line from 2003 to 2009 light rail vehicles were used on the existing railway between gouda and alphen aan den rijn from 2003 to 2009 there was test traffic with light rail vehicles on the heavy rail track from gouda to alphen aan den rijn for leiden , the plan was to have new track through the centre ( breestraat ) at street level ( alternatives that were proposed were around the centre on existing track , or in a tunnel through the centre ) in august 2009 it was announced that the proposed precursor of the rgl on the gouda-alphen route would disappear as of 13 december 2009 , because using only sprinter the train timetables could be improved according to the last urban vision , the tram would cross the railway in the rijnsbruger tunnel instead of the joop walenkamp tunnel , implying the removal of the bicycle lane and taxi stop the critics were in favour of extending the rail line from leiden to utrecht , and investment in dedicated bus lanes on the route from leiden to katwijk and noordwijk in one of those alternatives the rgl would follow the existing route of the railway line all the way to leiden centraal , or to a point near the station from transferium 't schouw a44 , the rgl would go as light rail to katwijk aan den rijn , then fork into branches to katwijk aan zee and noordwijk respectively the tram system was initially intended to be a much larger light rail network , with branches to leiderdorp , the district of ridderfeld in alphen and schiphol completion depended on financial support from the national government , and in the autumn of 2009 , state secretary of transport tineke huizinga indicated that the line to katwijk would cost €45 million there is a fence between the two separate tracks , to improve driver safety as the cab door opens directly onto the track , not on the platform in the beginning they were used on the regular railway service between gouda and alphen aan den rijn the province of south holland was in favour of this , but based on a referendum in march 2007 among the leiden population , the municipality was against it however the number of passengers per day , around 5,000 , during the period 2003-2009 was stable , despite a large increase in many other rail routes in the randstad these were bombardier a32s , a model that is also used on the tvärbanan light rail line in stockholm
