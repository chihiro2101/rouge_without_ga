many instruments ' frets are not spaced according to the semitones of equal temperament , including the appalachian dulcimer ( with frets in a diatonic scale ) , the turkish saz ( with frets spaced according to the makam system of turkish folk music ) , the arabic buzuq ( with frets spaced according to the arabic maqam system ) , and the persian setar and tar ( with frets spaced according to the persian dastgah system ) , and the turkish tanbur ( with as many as 5 frets per semitone , to cover all of the commas of the turkish makam system ) fan frets ( also fanned frets , slanted frets ) , or multi-scale : while frets are generally perpendicular to the instrument 's neck centerline and parallel to each other , on a '' fanned '' fretboard , the frets are angled ( spread like a fan ) with only one center fret perpendicular to the neck â€™ s centerline in some songs , such as '' my last serenade '' by killswitch engage , the guitars are tuned to dropped c and the low tension of the strings is used to create fret buzz by the bass player in order to create a dirty sound since the intonation of most modern western fretted instruments is equal tempered , the ratio of the distances of two consecutive frets to the bridge is \sqrt12 ( the twelfth root of two ) , or approximately 1.059463 when this happens , the instrument may need refretting ( the frets are removed and replaced ) or , in less severe cases , '' fret dressing '' ( the frets are leveled , polished , and possibly recrowned ) fat frets : on older guitars ( especially the fender stratocaster ) , frets were typically made out of thin wire , and some electric guitar players replaced that with thicker wire , for '' fat frets '' or '' jumbo frets '' a side effect of a thicker fret is a less precise note , since the string is held over a wider surface , causing a slight inaccuracy of pitch , which increases in significance as frets wear pressing the string against the fret reduces the vibrating length of the string to that between the bridge and the next fret between the fretting finger and the bridge image : saz frets.jpg thumb right frets tied on to the neck of a saz ; note microtone frets between semitones on instruments equipped with steel strings , such as folk guitars and electric guitars , frets are eventually bound to wear down as the strings cut grooves into them fret buzz can be caused by different things : low action improperly installed frets strings too loose improper relief of guitar neck fret buzz is evident in some famous recordings ; an example is '' friends '' by led zeppelin ( although this example is undoubtedly caused by alternate open tunings that reduce string tension )
