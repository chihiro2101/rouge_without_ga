it was found that this cloud , which as seen from earth is zodiacal light , was not centered on the sun , as previously thought , but on a place in space a few million kilometers away cobe would have to operate for a minimum of 6 months , and constrain the amount of radio interference from the ground , cobe and other satellites as well as radiative interference from the earth , sun and moon when these data were joined with 60 and 100 μm data taken from iras , it was found that the far-infrared luminosity arises from cold ( ≈17–22 k ) dust associated with diffuse hi cirrus clouds , 15-30 % from cold ( ≈19 k ) dust associated with molecular gas , and less than 10 % from warm ( ≈29 k ) dust in the extended low-density hii regions according to the model , if our sun is 8.6 kpc from the galactic center , then the sun is 15.6 pc above the midplane of the disk , which has a radial and vertical scale lengths of 2.64 and 0.333 kpc , respectively , and is warped in a way consistent with the hi layer the dmr was able to spend four years mapping the detectable anisotropy of cosmic background radiation as it was the only instrument not dependent on the dewar 's supply of helium to keep it cooled first , in 1981 , two teams of astronomers , one led by david wilkinson of princeton university and the other by francesco melchiorri of the university of florence , simultaneously announced that they detected a quadrupole distribution of cmb using balloon-borne instruments the overriding considerations were the need for full sky coverage , the need to eliminate stray radiation from the instruments and the need to maintain thermal stability of the dewar and the instruments the results of firas were startling in that they showed a perfect fit of the cmb and the theoretical curve for a black body at a temperature of 2.7 k , thus proving the berkeley-nagoya results erroneous second , in 1987 a japanese-american team led by andrew lange and paul richards of uc berkeley and toshio matsumoto of nagoya university made an announcement that cmb was not that of a true black body a direct measurement of the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) can also provide important constraints on the integrated cosmological history of star formation , metal and dust production , and the conversion of starlight into infrared emissions by dust a 900 & nbsp ; km altitude orbit with a 99° inclination was chosen as it fit within the capabilities of either a shuttle ( with an auxiliary propulsion on cobe ) or a delta rocket the need to control systematic error in the measurement of the cmb anisotropy and measuring the zodiacal cloud at different elongation angles for subsequent modeling required that the satellite rotate at a 0.8 rpm spin rate the cosmic microwave background radiation is a remnant of the big bang and the fluctuations are the imprint of density contrast in the early universe the spin axis is also tilted back from the orbital velocity vector as a precaution against possible deposits of residual atmospheric gas on the optics as well against the infrared glow that would result from fast neutral particles hitting its surfaces at extremely high speed
