roth wrote in the preface to the book 's 30th anniversary edition : '' with clarity and with crudeness , and a great deal of exuberance , the embryonic writer who was me wrote these stories in his early 20s , while he was a graduate student at the university of chicago , a soldier stationed in new jersey and washington , and a novice english instructor back at chicago following his army discharge.in the beginning it amazed him that any literate audience could seriously be interested in his story of tribal secrets , in what he knew , as a child of his neighborhood , about the rites and taboos of his clan—about their aversions , their aspirations , their fears of deviance and defection , their embarrassments and ideas of success the title functions as a trick : to tempt and enable a reader to simultaneously hear the point that is made by '' goodbye '' in each of the two songs ( two incompatible points ) , while watching neil ambivalently and uncomfortably tip back and forth between the two of them , and to simultaneously feel those attitudes and roth 's attitudes toward them , in order to see , among other things , the incompleteness and distortedness of each of the three goodbye-sayers ' view of what he is saying goodbye to we can safely assume that when roth decided on a title for it , he realized that the percentage of the subscribers to the paris review ( in which the novella came out in 1958 ) and the percentage of the readers of any book in which it would later be published who had heard the yiddish song—which is n't quoted or mentioned in the novella—in 1926 or later and also remembered its fourth stanza would be a very small minority of the novella ’ s audience thus , the alma mater nostalgia of the novella 's title can be heard as a choral parallel to neil 's saying goodbye to the affluent , assimilated world of the patimkins and , in his unreported future , remembering , re-evaluating and possibly , in low moments or periods , missing it and them the title story of the collection , goodbye , columbus , was an irreverent look at the life of middle-class jewish americans , satirizing , according to one reviewer , their '' complacency , parochialism , and materialism this song 's columbus is not a campus but rather the man who induced europeans to follow him to america , and its '' goodbye '' ( unlike the one in the college song ) is neither a sentimental summation nor a grateful or admiring one the title “ goodbye , columbus ” is a quote from a song that was sung by the departing seniors , including brenda 's brother , ron , at their graduation from the ohio state university at columbus ” the flair , high-hattiness and bite of some of the lyrics—especially , the line that became the title of the novella—would have appealed to neil klugman and the very young philip roth this short story , which first appeared in the paris review in 1958 , deals with the themes of questioning religion and being violent to one another because of it the title character goes through a crisis , feeling at age fifty-nine that by accepting the responsibilities of business , marriage , and parenthood , he has missed out on life , and starts an affair with another woman
