monocrystalline silicon ( mono-si ) grown by the czochralski method is often referred to as monocrystalline czochralski silicon ( cz-si ) it is the basic material in the production of integrated circuits used in computers , tvs , mobile phones and all types of electronic equipment and semiconductor devices dopant impurity atoms such as boron or phosphorus can be added to the molten silicon in precise amounts to dope the silicon , thus changing it into p-type or n-type silicon , with different electronic properties by precisely controlling the temperature gradients , rate of pulling and speed of rotation , it is possible to extract a large , single-crystal , cylindrical ingot from the melt occurrence of unwanted instabilities in the melt can be avoided by investigating and visualizing the temperature and velocity fields during the crystal growth process when the silicon is fully melted , a small seed crystal mounted on the end of a rotating shaft is slowly lowered until it dips just below the surface of the molten silicon the electrical characteristics of the silicon are controlled by adding material like phosphorus or boron to the silicon before it is melted this method is also used with semiconductor materials other than silicon , such as gallium arsenide image : silicon seed crystal puller rod.jpg thumb 240px a puller rod with seed crystal for growing single-crystal silicon by the czochralski method thumb thumb when silicon is grown by the czochralski method , the melt is contained in a silica ( quartz ) crucible it was experimentally shown in the 1990s that the high oxygen concentration is also beneficial for the radiation hardness of silicon particle detectors used in harsh radiation environment ( such as cern 's lhc/hl-lhc projects ) : k_o : segregation coefficient : v_0 : initial volume : i_0 : number of impurities : c_0 : impurity concentration in the melt : v_l : volume of the melt : i_l : number of impurities in the melt : c_l : concentration of impurities in the melt : v_s : volume of solid : c_s : concentration of impurities in the solid during the growth process , volume of melt dv freezes , and there are impurities from the melt that are removed
