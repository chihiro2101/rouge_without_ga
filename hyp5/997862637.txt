radio clocks synchronized to a terrestrial time signal can usually achieve an accuracy within a hundredth of a second relative to the time standard , generally limited by uncertainties and variability in radio propagation some timekeepers , particularly watches such as some casio wave ceptors which are more likely than desk clocks to be used when travelling , can synchronise to any one of several different time signals transmitted in different regions descriptions a current list of times signal stations is published by the bipm as an appendix to their annual report ; the appendix includes coordinates of transmitter sites , operating schedules for stations , and the uncertainty of the carrier frequency of transmitters many other countries can receive these signals ( jjy can sometimes be received in new zealand , western australia , tasmania , southeast asia , parts of western europe and the pacific northwest of north america at night ) , but success depends on the time of day , atmospheric conditions , and interference from intervening buildings a number of manufacturers and retailers sell radio clocks that receive coded time signals from a radio station , which , in turn , derives the time from a true atomic clock inexpensive clocks keep track of the time between updates , or in their absence , with a non-disciplined quartz-crystal clock , with the accuracy typical of non-radio-controlled quartz timepieces ; attached to other broadcast stations : broadcast stations in many countries have carriers precisely synchronized to a standard phase and frequency , such as the bbc radio 4 longwave service on 198 & nbsp ; khz , and some also transmit sub-audible or even inaudible time-code information , like the radio france longwave transmitter on 162 & nbsp ; khz dab systems can equal gps stratum 2 accuracy ( short term clock discipline ) and stratum 1 ( long term clock discipline ) provided the transmitter site ( or network ) supports that level of functionality ; digital radio mondiale : drm is able to send a clock signal , but one not as precise as navigation satellite clock signals analog radio clock in 201704.jpg a low frequency ( lf ) radio clock low cost dcf77 receiver.jpg lf time signal receiver junghans mega.jpg world 's first radio clock wrist watch , junghans mega ( analog model ) citizen attesa eco-drive atv53-3023 01.jpg citizen attesa eco-drive atv53-3023 analog-digital chronograph with 4 area radio controlled reception ( north america , europe , china , japan ) file : funkuhr.jpg radio controlled analog wall clock file : dcf77 controlled alarmclock.jpg radio controlled alarm clock file : bahnsteiguhr.jpg the dcf77 time signal is used by organizations like the deutsche bahn railway company to synchronize their station clocks gps , galileo and glonass satellite navigation systems have one or more caesium , rubidium or hydrogen maser atomic clocks on each satellite , referenced to a clock or clocks on the ground many modern radio clocks use the global positioning system to provide more accurate time than can be obtained from terrestrial radio stations no gps receiver directly computes time or frequency , rather they use gps to discipline an oscillator that may range from a quartz crystal in a low-end navigation receiver , through oven-controlled crystal oscillators ( ocxo ) in specialized units , to atomic oscillators ( rubidium ) in some receivers used for synchronization in telecommunications although any satellite navigation receiver that is performing its primary navigational function must have an internal time reference accurate to a small fraction of a second , the displayed time is often not as precise as the internal clock
