major developments and innovations include : norfolk four-course crop rotation : fodder crops , particularly turnips and clover , replaced leaving the land fallow enclosure : the removal of common rights to establish exclusive ownership of land development of a national market free of tariffs , tolls and customs barriers transportation infrastructures , such as improved roads , canals , and later , railways land conversion , land drains and reclamation increase in farm size selective breeding one of the most important innovations of the british agricultural revolution was the development of the norfolk four-course rotation , which greatly increased crop and livestock yields by improving soil fertility and reducing fallow crop rotation is the practice of growing a series of dissimilar types of crops in the same area in sequential seasons to help restore plant nutrients and mitigate the build-up of pathogens and pests that often occurs when one plant species is continuously cropped the norfolk system , as it is now known , rotates crops so that different crops are planted with the result that different kinds and quantities of nutrients are taken from the soil as the plants grow during the middle ages , the open field system had initially used a two-field crop rotation system where one field was left fallow or turned into pasture for a time to try to recover some of its plant nutrients over the following two centuries , the regular planting of legumes such as peas and beans in the fields that were previously fallow slowly restored the fertility of some croplands the planting of legumes helped to increase plant growth in the empty field due to the ability of the bacteria on legume roots to fix nitrogen ( n 2 ) from the air into the soil in a form that plants could use the farmers in flanders ( in parts of france and current day belgium ) discovered a still more effective four-field crop rotation system , using turnips and clover ( a legume ) as forage crops to replace the three-year crop rotation fallow year fallow land was about 20 % of the arable area in england in 1700 before turnips and clover were extensively grown in the 1830s the addition of clover and turnips allowed more animals to be kept through the winter , which in turn produced more milk , cheese , meat and manure , which maintained soil fertility the mix of crops also changed : the area under wheat rose by 1870 to 3.5 & nbsp ; million acres ( 1.4m ha ) , barley to 2.25m acres ( 0.9m ha ) and oats less dramatically to 2.75m acres ( 1.1m ha ) , while rye dwindled to 60,000 acres ( 25,000 ha ) , less than a tenth of its late medieval peak grain yields benefited from new and better seed alongside improved rotation and fertility : wheat yields increased by a quarter in the 18th century and nearly half in the 19th , averaging 30 bushels per acre ( 2,080 & nbsp ; kg/ha ) by the 1890s the plough was easy for a blacksmith to make , but by the end of the 18th century it was being made in rural foundries some practices of enclosure were denounced by the church , and legislation was drawn up against it ; but the large , enclosed fields were needed for the gains in agricultural productivity from the 16th to 18th centuries by the 19th century , marketing was nationwide and the vast majority of agricultural production was for market rather than for the farmer and his family the next stage of development was trading between markets , requiring merchants , credit and forward sales , knowledge of markets and pricing and of supply and demand in different markets due to the large and dense population of flanders and holland , farmers there were forced to take maximum advantage of every bit of usable land ; the country had become a pioneer in canal building , soil restoration and maintenance , soil drainage , and land reclamation technology with the development of regional markets and eventually a national market , aided by improved transportation infrastructures , farmers were no longer dependent on their local market and were less subject to having to sell at low prices into an oversupplied local market and not being able to sell their surpluses to distant localities that were experiencing shortages in england , robert bakewell and thomas coke introduced selective breeding as a scientific practice , mating together two animals with particularly desirable characteristics , and also using inbreeding or the mating of close relatives , such as father and daughter , or brother and sister , to stabilise certain qualities in order to reduce genetic diversity in desirable animal programmes from the mid-18th century the lincoln ( sheep ) was improved by bakewell , and in turn the lincoln was used to develop the subsequent breed , named the new ( or dishley ) leicester previously , cattle were first and foremost kept for pulling ploughs as oxen or for dairy uses , with beef from surplus males as an additional bonus , but he crossed long-horned heifers and a westmoreland bull to eventually create the english longhorn the average weight of a bull sold for slaughter at smithfield was reported around 1700 as 370 pounds ( 170 & nbsp ; kg ) , though this is considered a low estimate : by 1786 , weights of 840 pounds ( 380 & nbsp ; kg ) were reported , john r higher yield per acre crops were also planted as potatoes went from about 300,000 acres in 1800 to about 400,000 acres in 1850 with a further increase to about 500,000 in 1900 with more capital invested , more organic and inorganic fertilisers , and better crop yields increased the food grown at about 0.5 % /year—not enough to keep up with population growth great britain contained about 10.8 & nbsp ; million people in 1801 , 20.7 & nbsp ; million in 1851 and 37.1 & nbsp ; million by 1901 this corresponds to an annual population growth rate of 1.3 % in 1801-1851 and 1.2 % in 1851–1901 , twice the rate of agricultural output growth in addition to land for cultivation there was also a demand for pasture land to support more livestock the growth of arable acreage slowed from the 1830s and went into reverse from the 1870s in the face of cheaper grain imports , and wheat acreage nearly halved from 1870 to 1900 the recovery of food imports after the napoleonic wars ( 1803–1815 ) and the resumption of american trade following the war of 1812 ( 1812–1815 ) led to the enactment in 1815 of the corn laws ( protective tariffs ) to protect cereal grain producers in britain against foreign competition though the blight also struck scotland , wales , england , and much of continental europe , its effect there was far less severe since potatoes constituted a much smaller percentage of the diet than in ireland hundreds of thousands died in the famine and millions more emigrated to england , wales , scotland , canada , australia , europe , and the united states , reducing the population from about 8.5 & nbsp ; million in 1845 to 4.3 & nbsp ; million by 1921 at the same time , large amounts of cheap corned beef started to arrive from argentina , and the opening of the suez canal in 1869 and the development of refrigerator ships ( reefers ) in about 1880 opened the british market to cheap meat and wool from australia , new zealand , and argentina it hit the agricultural sector hard and was the most severe in europe and the united states , which had been experiencing strong economic growth fuelled by the second industrial revolution in the decade following the american civil war before the introduction of the seed drill , the common practice was to plant seeds by broadcasting ( evenly throwing ) them across the ground by hand on the prepared soil and then lightly harrowing the soil to cover the seed the agricultural revolution was part of a long process of improvement , but sound advice on farming began to appear in england in the mid-17th century , from writers such as samuel hartlib , walter blith and others , thirsk 'walter blith ' in oxford dictionary of national biography online edn , jan 2008 and the overall agricultural productivity of britain started to grow significantly only in the period of the agricultural revolution despite its name , the agricultural revolution in britain did not result in overall productivity per hectare of agricultural area as high as in china , where intensive cultivation ( including multiple annual cropping in many areas ) had been practiced for many centuries the agricultural revolution in britain proved to be a major turning point in history , allowing the population to far exceed earlier peaks and sustain the country 's rise to industrial pre-eminence towards the end of the 19th century , the substantial gains in british agricultural productivity were rapidly offset by competition from cheaper imports , made possible by the exploitation of new lands and advances in transportation , refrigeration , and other technologies
