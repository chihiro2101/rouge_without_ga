claudius ' family kept him out of public life until his sudden coronation at the age of fifty because of his persistent stammer , limp , and other nervous tics , which caused others to perceive him as mentally deficient and not a threat to his ambitious relatives even as his symptoms began to wane in his teenage years , he ran into trouble as a budding historian ; his work on a history of the roman civil wars was too truthful and too critical of the reigning emperor augustus , and his mother antonia minor and grandmother livia quickly put a stop to it claudius was portrayed this way by scholars for most of history , and graves uses these peculiarities to develop a sympathetic character whose survival in a murderous dynasty depends upon his family 's incorrect assumption that he is a harmless idiot i , claudius is written as a first-person narrative of roman history from claudius ' perspective , covering the reigns of augustus , tiberius , and caligula ; claudius the god is written as a later addition documenting claudius ' own reign the real claudius was a trained historian and is known to have written an autobiography ( now lost ) in eight books that covered the same period graves provides a theme for the story by having the fictional claudius describe a visit to cumae , where he receives a prophecy in verse from the sibyl and an additional prophecy contained in a book of '' sibylline curiosities '' claudius believes this means that his secret memoirs will one day be found and that he , having written the truth , will speak clearly , while his contemporaries , who had to distort their histories to appease the ruling family , will seem like stammerers since he wishes to record his life for posterity , claudius explains that he chooses to write in greek , which he believes will remain '' the chief literary language of the world '' writing in the first-person ( from an unspecified time period , presumably late in his own reign as emperor ) , claudius establishes himself as the author of this history of his family and insists on writing the truth , which includes harsh criticisms of the deified augustus and especially of livia the narrative begins prior to his own birth , as he describes many of the events leading to the foundation of the roman principate and the increasingly firm emplacement of augustus as emperor despite augustus ' own publicly expressed intention to eventually restore the former republic claudius reveals that these untimely deaths are all the machinations of augustus ' third wife livia ( who is also claudius ' paternal grandmother ) , a calculating murderess who seeks to make her son tiberius ( claudius ' uncle ) succeed augustus as the next emperor as tiberius becomes more hated by the public , he increasingly relies on his praetorian captain sejanus to administer his edicts and punishments , who is able to manipulate tiberius into suspecting that germanicus ' wife agrippina and his own son castor are plotting to usurp the monarchy she privately admits to claudius to having ordered the poisonings and assassinations of many people , and then begs claudius to swear to deify her as a goddess , believing it will grant her a blissful afterlife , to which he agrees tiberius is soon alerted to sejanus ' treachery by a letter from antonia minor and allies himself with caligula , despite his awareness of caligula 's growing wickedness and narcissism , and transfers control of rome to the even more despotic naevius sutorius macro he sadly accepts for the sake of his wife and unborn child , and for the access the emperorship will give him to valuable historical documents , on a whim deciding that as emperor he will finally be able to demand that people read his books the story begins with an apology by claudius for having ended his first history on a dramatic point and continues with a brief history of his friend herod agrippa he applies himself to the law courts , demonstrates his intelligence in being able to locate one of augustus ' lost eagles , and orders the building of a harbour in ostia to help preserve the roman food supply on being relieved of the '' olympian mixture '' , claudius is crushed and decides that the only way the republic can be restored is by having a true mad monarch rather than the reign of a benevolent one they remain graves ' best known work , aside from his myth essay the white goddess , his english translation of the golden ass , and his own autobiography good-bye to all that he collaborated with translator hans rothe and they jointly produced a shortened edition which left out the many digressions which were incorporated into the english original , with the aim of presenting claudius ' story in a clearer and more effective way graves ' own preface to the german edition as published by paul list , münchen ( 1947 ) – the book is published as ich claudius , kaiser und gott ( i claudius , emperor and god ) with graves being styled robert von ranke graves , which is how he is credited in all german editions of his works in 1976 , bbc television adapted the book and its sequel into the popular tv serial i , claudius , starring derek jacobi , siân phillips , brian blessed , and john hurt in november and december 2010 , as part of the classic serial strand , bbc radio 4 broadcast a series of six hour-long episodes of a dramatisation of both novels , adapted by robin brooks and directed by jonquil panting an episode from '' claudius the god '' was adapted for comics in the ec comics two-fisted tales 36 , in a story titled '' battle !
