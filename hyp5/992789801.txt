points j , k , and l are the midpoints of the line segments between each altitude 's vertex intersection ( points a , b , and c ) and the triangle 's orthocenter ( point s ) for an acute triangle , six of the points ( the midpoints and altitude feet ) lie on the triangle itself ; for an obtuse triangle two of the altitudes have feet outside the triangle , but these feet still belong to the nine-point circle although he is credited for its discovery , karl wilhelm feuerbach did not entirely discover the nine-point circle , but rather the six-point circle , recognizing the significance of the midpoints of the three sides of the triangle and the feet of the altitudes of that triangle in 1822 karl feuerbach discovered that any triangle 's nine-point circle is externally tangent to that triangle 's three excircles and internally tangent to its incircle ; this result is known as feuerbach 's theorem the circle which passes through the feet of the altitudes of a triangle is tangent to all four circles which in turn are tangent to the three sides of the triangle figure 4 the center n of the nine-point circle bisects a segment from the orthocenter h to the circumcenter o ( making the orthocenter a center of dilation to both circles ) : posamentier , alfred s the nine-point circle of a reference triangle is the circumcircle of both the reference triangle 's medial triangle ( with vertices at the midpoints of the sides of the reference triangle ) and its orthic triangle ( with vertices at the feet of the reference triangle 's altitudes ) furthermore because of the feuerbach conic theorem mentioned above , there exists a unique rectangular circumconic , centered at the common intersection point of the four nine-point circles , that passes through the four original arbitrary points as well as the orthocenters of the four triangles furthermore the cyclic quadrilateral formed from the four nine-pont centers is homothetic to the reference cyclic quadrilateral abcd by a factor of & nbsp ; & minus ; 1 / 2 & nbsp ; and its homothetic center ( n ) lies on the line connecting the circumcenter ( o ) to the anticenter ( m ) where : :on 2nm the circle is an instance of a conic section and the nine-point circle is an instance of the general nine-point conic that has been constructed with relation to a triangle abc and a fourth point p , where the particular nine-point circle instance arises when p is the orthocenter of abc the conic is an ellipse when p is interior to abc or in a region sharing vertical angles with the triangle , but a nine-point hyperbola occurs when p is in one of the three adjacent regions , and the hyperbola is rectangular when p lies on the circumcircle of abc
