its basin includes much of china , eastern and southeastern russia , japan , the korean peninsula , most of indochina , indonesia and malaysia , the philippines , all of the pacific islands , the northeast coast of australia , and canada and the united states west of the continental divide ( including most of alaska ) , as well as western central america and south america west of the andes other endorheic regions include the great basin in the united states , much of the sahara desert , the drainage basin of the okavango river ( kalahari basin ) , highlands near the african great lakes , the interiors of australia and the arabian peninsula , and parts in mexico and the andes the arctic ocean drains most of western and northern canada east of the continental divide , northern alaska and parts of north dakota , south dakota , minnesota , and montana in the united states , the north shore of the scandinavian peninsula in europe , central and northern russia , and parts of kazakhstan and mongolia in asia , which totals to about 17 % of the world 's land in hydrology , the drainage basin is a logical unit of focus for studying the movement of water within the hydrological cycle , because the majority of water that discharges from the basin outlet originated as precipitation falling on the basin in the thiessen polygon method , the drainage basin is divided into polygons with the rain gauge in the middle of each polygon assumed to be representative for the rainfall on the area of land included in its polygon the five largest river basins ( by area ) , from largest to smallest , are the basins of the amazon ( 7m km , the congo ( 4m km , the nile ( 3.4m km , the mississippi ( 3.22m km , and the r√≠o de la plata ( 3.17m km , international treaty and , within the us , interstate compacts ) or other political entities in a particular drainage basin to manage the body or bodies of water into which it drains in north america , surface water drains to the atlantic via the saint lawrence river and great lakes basins , the eastern seaboard of the united states , the maritimes , and most of newfoundland and labrador the mediterranean sea basin includes much of north africa , east-central africa ( through the nile river ) , southern , central , and eastern europe , turkey , and the coastal areas of israel , lebanon , and syria a portion of the water that enters the groundwater system beneath the drainage basin may flow towards the outlet of another drainage basin because groundwater flow directions do not always match those of their overlying drainage network with the water , they are transported towards the outlet of the basin , and can affect the ecological processes along the way as well as in the receiving water source interior between the appalachian and rocky mountains , a small part of the canadian provinces of alberta and saskatchewan , eastern central america , the islands of the caribbean and the gulf , and a small part of northern south america nearly all of south america east of the andes also drains to the atlantic , as does most of western and central europe and the greatest portion of western sub-saharan africa , as well as western sahara and part of morocco a drainage basin is the source for water and sediment that moves from higher elevation through the river system to lower elevations as they reshape the channel forms isochrone maps can be used to show the time taken for runoff water within a drainage basin to reach a lake , reservoir or outlet , assuming constant and uniform effective rainfall
