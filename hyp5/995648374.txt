many history of technology consider that true machine tools were born when the toolpath first became guided by the machine itself in some way , at least to some extent , so that direct , freehand human guidance of the toolpath ( with hands , feet , or mouth ) was no longer the only guidance used in the cutting or forming process in this view of the definition , the term , arising at a time when all tools up till then had been hand tools , simply provided a label for '' tools that were machines instead of hand tools '' early lathes , those prior to the late medieval period , and modern woodworking lathes and potter 's wheels may or may not fall under this definition , depending on how one views the headstock spindle itself ; but the earliest historical records of a lathe with direct mechanical control of the cutting tool 's path are of a screw-cutting lathe dating to about 1483 the process of feature replication allows the flatness and squareness of a milling machine or the roundness , lack of taper , and squareness of the two axes of a lathe machine to be transferred to a machined work piece with accuracy and precision better than a thousandth of an inch , not as fine as millionths of an inch as the fit between sliding parts of a made product , machine , or machine tool approaches this critical thousandth of an inch measurement , lubrication and capillary action combine to prevent van der waals force from welding like metals together , extending the lubricated life of sliding parts by a factor of thousands to millions ; the disaster of oil depletion in the conventional automotive engine is an accessible demonstration of the need , and in aerospace design , like-to-unlike design is used along with solid lubricants to prevent van der waals welding from destroying mating surfaces matter-additive , matter-preserving , and matter-subtractive '' manufacturing '' can proceed in 16 ways : the work may be held in a hand or a clamp ; the tool may be held in a hand ( the other hand ) or a clamp ; the power can come from the hand ( s ) holding the tool and/or the work , or from some external source , including a foot treadle by the same worker , or a motor without limitation ; and the control can come from the hand ( s ) holding the tool and/or the work , or from some other source , including computer numerical control the value that machine tools added to these human talents is in the areas of rigidity ( constraining the toolpath despite thousands of newtons ( pounds ) of force fighting against the constraint ) , accuracy and precision , efficiency , and productivity with a machine tool , toolpaths that no human muscle could constrain can be constrained ; and toolpaths that are technically possible with freehand methods , but would require tremendous time and skill to execute , can instead be executed quickly and easily , even by people with little freehand talent ( because the machine takes care of it ) the latter aspect of machine tools is often referred to by historians of technology as '' building the skill into the tool '' , in contrast to the toolpath-constraining skill being in the person who wields the tool national bureau of economic research ( nber ) referenced the definition of a machine tool as '' any machine operating by other than hand power which employs a tool to work on metal '' however , economists use a slightly broader sense that also includes metal deformation of other types that squeeze the metal into shape without cutting off swarf , such as rolling , stamping with dies , shearing , swaging , riveting , and others which is also a history of the machine tool industry in general from the 1940s through the 1980s ; he was reflecting the sense of the term used by houdaille itself and other firms in the industry the many more recently developed processes labeled '' machining '' , such as electrical discharge machining , electrochemical machining , electron beam machining , photochemical machining , and ultrasonic machining , or even plasma cutting and water jet cutter , are often performed by machines that could most logically be called machine tools in addition , some of the newly developed additive manufacturing processes , which are not about cutting away material but rather about adding it , are done by machines that are likely to end up labeled , in some cases , as machine tools many speakers resist using the term '' machine tool '' to refer to woodworking machinery ( joiners , table saws , routing stations , and so on ) , but it is difficult to maintain any true logical dividing line , and therefore many speakers accept a broad definition usually the mass noun '' machinery '' encompasses them , but sometimes it is used to imply only those machines that are being excluded from the definition of '' machine tool '' this is why the machines in a food-processing plant , such as conveyors , mixers , vessels , dividers , and so on , may be labeled '' machinery '' , while the machines in the factory 's tool and die department are instead called '' machine tools '' in contradistinction regarding the 1930s nber definition quoted above , one could argue that its specificity to metal is obsolete , as it is quite common today for particular lathes , milling machines , and machining centers ( definitely machine tools ) to work exclusively on plastic cutting jobs throughout their whole working lifespan and its specificity to '' operating by other than hand power '' is also problematic , as machine tools can be powered by people if appropriately set up , such as with a treadle ( for a lathe ) or a hand lever ( for a shaper ) thus one can question whether power source is truly a key distinguishing concept ; but for economics purposes , the nber 's definition made sense , because most of the commercial value of the existence of machine tools comes about via those that are powered by electricity , hydraulics , and so on . but it was not until the later middle ages and the age of enlightenment that the modern concept of a machine tool—a class of machines used as tools in the making of metal parts , and incorporating machine-guided toolpath—began to evolve during the 18th and 19th centuries , and even in many cases in the 20th , the builders of machine tools tended to be the same people who would then use them to produce the end products ( manufactured goods ) in order of historical emergence , they have been firearms ( small arms and artillery ) ; clocks ; textile machinery ; steam engines ( stationary , marine , rail , and otherwise ) ( the story of how watt 's need for an accurate cylinder spurred boulton 's boring machine is discussed by roe ) ; sewing machines ; bicycles ; automobiles ; and aircraft in his paper presented to the british association for the advancement of science at glasgow in 1840 , whitworth pointed out the inherent inaccuracy of grinding due to no control and thus unequal distribution of the abrasive material between the plates which would produce uneven removal of material from the plates human and animal power ( via cranks , treadles , treadmills , or treadwheels ) were used in the past , as was water power ( via water wheel ) ; however , following the development of high-pressure steam engines in the mid 19th century , factories increasingly used steam power examples of machine tools are : broaching machine drill press gear shaper hobbing machine hone lathe screw machines milling machine shear ( sheet metal ) shaper planer stewart platform mills grinding machines multitasking machines ( mtms ) —cnc machine tools with many axes that combine turning , milling , grinding , and material handling into one highly automated machine tool when fabricating or shaping parts , several techniques are used to remove unwanted metal
