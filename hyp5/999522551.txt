eventually the reel-to-reel recorder was completely displaced , in part because of the usage constraints presented by their large size , expense , and the inconvenience of threading and rewinding the tape reels - cassettes are more portable and can be stopped and immediately removed in the middle of playback without rewinding however , systems such as xdr , along with the adoption of higher-grade tape ( such as chromium dioxide , but typically recorded in such a way as to play back at the normal 120 Î¼s position ) , and the frequent use of dolby hx pro , meant that cassettes became a viable high-fidelity option , one that was more portable and required less maintenance than records today , cassette decks are not considered by most people to be either the most versatile or highest fidelity sound recording devices available , as even very inexpensive cd or digital audio players can reproduce a wide frequency range with no speed variations in later years , an '' auto reverse '' feature appeared that allowed the deck to play ( and , in some decks , record ) on both sides of the cassette without the operator having to manually remove , flip , and re-insert the cassette analog cassette deck sales were expected to decline rapidly with the advent of the compact disc and other digital recording technologies such as digital audio tape ( dat ) , minidisc , and the cd-r recorder drives in addition , cover art , which had generally previously been restricted to a single image of the lp cover along with a minimum of text , began to be tailored to cassettes as well , with fold-out lyric sheets or librettos and fold-out sleeves becoming commonplace tape recorder audio-quality had improved by the mid-1970s , and a cassette deck with manual level controls and vu meters became a standard component of home high-fidelity systems cassette equipment needs regular maintenance , as cassette tape is a magnetic medium which is in physical contact with the tape head and other metallic parts of the recorder/player mechanism the inclusion of logic gate and solenoid into the transport and control mechanisms of cassette decks , often referred to '' logic control , '' contrasts with earlier '' piano-key '' transport controls and mechanical linkages both rca and bell sound attempted to commercialize the cartridge format , but a few factors stalled adoption , including lower-than-advertised availability of selections in the prerecorded media catalog , delays in production setup , and a stand-alone design that was not considered by audiophiles to be truly hi-fi ( such machines can be identified by the presence of a '' monitor '' switch with positions for '' tape '' and '' source '' , or similar a high-quality recording on cassette could rival the sound of an average commercial cd , though the quality of pre-recorded cassettes has been regarded by the general public as lower than could be achieved in a quality home recording with an estimated 15 % of the chain 's total tape business now generated by the sales of blanks , '' it would appear our added tape sales are going to tdk , maxell and sony , not you '' by the provision of a logical circuit in the control circuit for a magnetic recorder , even when the keys of the key board are actuated in any desired sequence , the magnetic recorder and its associated devices can be promptly and precisely controlled without causing any damages thereon he used this technique to demonstrate what he called '' the tunnel effect '' in the audio range of pre-recorded cassettes and commented to the reporter sam sutherland , who wrote a news article printed in billboard magazine : '' the buyer who is aware of sound quality is making his own philips responded with the digital compact cassette , a system which was backward-compatible with existing analog cassette recordings for playback , but it failed to garner a significant market share and was withdrawn by the late 1980s , thanks to such improvements in the electronics , the tape material and manufacturing techniques , as well as dramatic improvements to the precision of the cassette shell , tape heads and transport mechanics , sound fidelity on equipment from the top manufacturers far surpassed the levels originally expected of the medium the metal capstan and the rubber pinch roller can become coated with these particles , leading them to pull the tape less precisely over the head ; this in turn leads to misalignment of the tape over the head azimuth , producing noticeably unclear high tones , just as if the head itself were out of alignment a major boost to the cassette 's popularity came with the release of the sony walkman '' personal '' cassette player in 1979 , designed specifically as a headphone-only ultra-compact '' wearable '' music source later nakamichi auto-reverse models , the rx series , was essentially a single-directional deck , but with an added mechanism that physically removed the cassette from the transport , flipped it over , and re-inserted it a contributing factor may have been the inability of early cd players to reliably read discs with surface damage and offer anti-skipping features for applications where external vibration would be present , such as automotive and recreation environments even in a machine with a four channel head , slight asymmetries in the cassette shell make it difficult to align the head perfectly for both directions some cd recorders , particularly those intended for business use , incorporate a cassette deck to allow both formats for recording meetings , church sermons , and books on tape cassette decks soon came into widespread use and were designed variously for professional applications , home audio systems , and for mobile use in cars , as well as portable recorders dolby b was designed to address the high-frequency noise inherent in cassette tapes , and along with improvements in tape formulation it helped the cassette win acceptances as a high-fidelity medium many home and portable entertainment systems supported both formats and commonly allowed the cd playback to be recorded on cassette tape the first consumer tape recorder to employ a tape reel permanently housed in a small removable cartridge was the rca tape cartridge , which appeared in 1958 as a predecessor to the cassette format however , in many especially cheaper decks , this filter can not be disabled , and because of that record/playback frequency response in those decks typically is limited to 16 & nbsp ; khz the application of such digital electronics to cassette decks provides an early example of mechatronic design , which aims to enhance mechanical systems with electronic components in order to improve performance , increase system flexibility , or reduce cost although the vast majority of such players eventually sold were not sony products , the name '' walkman '' has become synonymous with this type of device a variety of noise reduction and other schemes are used to increase fidelity , with dolby b being almost universal for both prerecorded tapes and home recording
