in an interview conducted in 2005 , williams ' former promoter , pak-man , who worked on over half of the album with the rapper , spoke on the record , with his explanation leaning toward the album being intended as satire : '' at that time canibus was in the studio recording a lot of songs and i mean a lot , but he did n't want to make the fans wait no more so he did c true hollywood stories and he wanted to have fun wit , so thats what we did we had fun wit '' because wyclef produced the majority of the tracks on can-i-bus , williams blamed him for the general dissatisfaction with can-i-bus and cut ties with him , going as far as to diss wyclef , most notably on the title track of his second album ( '' you mad at the last album ? i apologize for it / yo , i ca n't call it , motherfucking wyclef spoiled it ! '' ) of note was the inclusion of '' poet laureate ii '' , a song exceeding seven minutes in length and lacking a chorus , with several changes of beat throughout ; the track was frequently singled out as one of the strongest in canibus ' career and the album as a whole convinced listeners and the industry alike that the rapper had not lost his potential featured the first collaboration between canibus and kurupt , ras kass and killah priest , a rap supergroup collectively known as the hrsmn ( referring to the four horsemen of the apocalypse ) , on the track '' horsementality '' in an interview on allhiphop.com posted on april 8 , 2005 , williams was asked what direction he was trying to take with that album ; in his response , he stated '' that album depicts the state of affairs in my life at the time – nothing more , nothing less '' the production on hip-hop for sale was handled in part by virginia-based producer nottz , with several relatively unknown producers handling the remaining tracks after nottz had cut ties with canibus due to the appearance of the vitruvian man.the day of hip-hop for sales release , mic club master volume one , a separate mixtape , appeared in stores , many of the songs receiving more praise than those present on the full-length album the track has 1,000 bars , in the form of five 200 bar verses , and is layered in such a way that '' when you mix it and spread it throughout five channels , you have the ability to mix the track differently every time '' his very next album , mind control , would receive him no acclaim whatsoever and was seen as a huge step backwards for the rapper , and would be the start of what is considered to be a downward slope for him also in 2005 , a collaboration between williams and underground rapper phoenix orion , who had also been known for scientific lyrics , yielded the album def con zero , released on the independent head trauma records label , owned by k-1 kickboxer dewey cooper additionally , due to the earlier release of mind control and the leaking of most of the material in the form of a mixtape entitled the vitruvian man , the release date had been pushed back to november , the original date having been may most explanations since the album 's release seem to lean towards the latter ; when canibus ' new official website , micclub.net , appeared online towards the end of 2002 , the summary of c true hollywood stories in the '' merchandise '' section called it '' an introspective look into the ultimate fan '' stan 's '' take on the current state of hip hop '' since 2000 , however , the members of the group have worked together on various songs and rumors of a full-length hrsmn album have persisted and include speculation about collaborations with pharoahe monch , common and rakim , among others a collection of previously recorded material ( with only three of the songs being unreleased ) produced entirely by mark sparks , the album failed to chart and is rarely considered an official canibus release by the rapper 's fans though much bitterness between canibus and wyclef jean remained for a period of time , the two artists finally settled their differences at the end of 2004 ; they have since worked together on two remixes of the machel montano song '' carnival survivors '' a pair of mixtapes , titled nothing to prove and nothing to lose , were slated for release in march 2007 , but were eventually scrapped ; instead , canibus decided to use the best material from each mixtape to create a new full-length album entitled for whom the beat tolls after the critical failure of c true hollywood stories , canibus was subject to criticism and ridicule from the rap industry until the release of mic club : the curriculum , his fourth full-length album , towards the end of 2002 before commencing his work with the military , however , he recorded a number of tracks which he intended to be released on his next album , entitled rip the jacker '' for whom the beat tolls '' was originally set for release in may 2007 , but was pushed back one month , and a released on june 12 , 2007 ( though it was not distributed by universal as previously reported ) he began rhyming in the early '90s and by 1992 under the name canibus sativa , and formed a duo called t.h.e.m an open letter , originally thought to have been written by canibus on tumblr , explaining his performance about the battle surfaced online , though it was later debunked by his manager as fake , saying that canibus will make an official statement when the time is right phoenix rise ( 2015 ) ( with bronze nazareth ) full spectrum dominance ep ( 2018 ) full spectrum dominance 2 ep ( 2018 ) full spectrum dominance 3 ep ( 2019 ) full spectrum dominance : repolarization ep ( 2019 ) hrsmn ( canibus with killah priest , kurupt & ras kass ) historic ep ( 2014 ) the undergods ( canibus with keith murray ) canibus & keith murray are the undergods ( 2009 ) in gods we trust – crush microphones to dust ( 2011 ) other collaborations def con zero ( 2005 ) ( with phoenix orion , as cloak-n-dagga ) lyrical warfare ( 2011 ) ( with webb , as t.h.e.m the other , titled '' lyrical law vs royce da 5 ' 9 '' '' was a length of audio in which he goes in depth about his perception of the situation and further insults royce da 5 ' 9 '' many listeners interpreted it as canibus ' botched attempt at becoming a commercial and mainstream artist and wrote him off as a one-hit wonder , while others have called it a concept album in which the rapper satirized the mainstream hip-hop scene canibus 's verse began with the line '' yo ll , is that a mic on your arm ? let me borrow that , '' referring to the microphone tattoo on ll cool j 's arm which ll cool j interpreted as canibus insulting him upon release , rip the jacker received rave reviews from the majority of critics , who noted that williams ' largely scientific lyrics and distinctive , rough delivery was finally matched by equally fine production , as canibus had a history of working with badly selected producers canibus had never planned for it to be compiled as a separate record , but agreed to release it through the independent gladiator music label as part of a contractual agreement ; most of the vocals for mind control had been recorded prior to the release of c true hollywood stories the following month , after numerous delays , canibus ' seventh solo album , hip-hop for sale , was released , but was panned by critics , who dismissed it as yet another failed attempt to gain mainstream recognition
