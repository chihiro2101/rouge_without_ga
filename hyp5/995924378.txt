scholars generally agree that tyrtaeus was a native of laconia for several reasons : the use of the first personal plural to include himself among the heraclidae whom zeus had given to sparta in fragment 2 ; the presence of occasional doric words in his vocabulary ; and his tone of authority when addressing spartan warriors , which would have been tolerated only if delivered by a spartan-born poet according to gerber ( 1997 ) , however , '' that skepticism has now largely disappeared '' , and disagreements among scholars now essentially revolves around the version of fragment 4 that should be accepted as genuine ( plutarch 's or diodorus ' version , or a combination of the two ) , and about the dating of fragment 12 , which some critics have assigned to the time of xenophanes ( c according to pausanias , the athenians sent the lame , mentally defective teacher-poet to sparta as a compromise , wishing to obey the oracle which had demanded an athenian , but unwilling to help the spartans in their war with a more capable individual it has been suggested that the depictions of tyrtaeus as a lame schoolmaster from athens were invented to denigrate sparta , which in the views of athenians could not have had a talented poet of its own '' iliad 13.130â€“33 , translated by r.lattimore , the iliad of homer , university of chicago press ( 1951 ) there is an important difference : homer describes the advance of one side in close formation , whereas tyrtaeus describes two sides meeting in the hoplite style of fighting modern scholars are less specific and provide instead date ranges for the second messenian war ( and thus for tyrtaeus ' life ) such as '' the latter part of the 7th century '' , v during the 19th and early 20th centuries , the picture of tyrtaeus ' life has been complicated by doubts about the authenticity of many of his verses , dated by various scholars to the 5th or 4th century bc traditional accounts of his life were almost entirely deduced from his poetry or were simply fiction , such as the account by pausanias of his supposed transformation from a lame and stupid school teacher in athens to the mastermind of spartan victories against the messenians locking spear by spear , shield against shield at the base , so buckler/ leaned on buckler , helmet on helmet , man against man , and the horse-hair crests along the horns of their shining helmets/ touched as they bent their heads , so dense were they formed on each other , the conquest of messenia in the eighth century , by the grandfathers of tyrtaeus 's generation , provided the foundation for a sophisticated and cultivated lifestyle he wrote a constitution for the lacedaemonians , precepts in elegiac verse , and war songs , in five books the continuance of those luxuries was '' dearly purchased '' in blood and toil by tyrtaeus 's generation when the messenians revolted , and the ensuing war and civil strife inspired his entire poetic work
