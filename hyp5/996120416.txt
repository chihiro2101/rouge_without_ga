finally , a further development leads to the so-called profiles-and-trends approach , at the core of which is an analysis of the relations between mental and behavioural variables , bearing in mind that socio-cultural trends influence both the diffusion of various lifestyles within a population and the emerging of different modalities of interaction between thought and action georg simmel carries out formal analysis of lifestyles , at the heart of which can be found processes of individualisation , identification , differentiation , and recognition , understood both as generating processes of , and effects generated by , lifestyles , operating '' vertically '' as well as '' horizontally '' initially , starting with alfred adler , a lifestyle was understood as a style of personality , in the sense that the framework of guiding values and principles which individuals develop in the first years of life end up defining a system of judgement which informs their actions throughout their lives subsequently , the perspective broadened to focus more generally on the level of daily life , concentrating – as in authors such as joffre dumazedier and anthony giddens – on the use of time , especially loisirs , and trying to study the interaction between the active dimension of choice and the dimension of routine and structuration which characterize that level of action then with daniel yankelovich and william wells we move on to the so-called aio approach in which attitudes , interests and opinions are considered as fundamental lifestyles ' components , being analysed from both synchronic and diachronic points of view and interpreted on the basis of socio-cultural trends in a given social context ( as , for instance , in bernard cathelat 's work ) later , particularly in milton rokeach 's work , arnold mitchell 's vals research and lynn kahle 's lov research , lifestyles ' analysis developed as profiles of values , reaching the hypothesis that it is possible to identify various models of scales of values organized hierarchically , to which different population sectors correspond max weber intends lifestyles as distinctive elements of status groups strictly connected with a dialectic of recognition of prestige : the lifestyle is the most visible manifestation of social differentiation , even within the same social class , and in particular it shows the prestige which the individuals believe they enjoy or to which they aspire finally , pierre bourdieu renews this approach within a more complex model in which lifestyles , made up mainly of social practices and closely tied to individual tastes , represent the basic point of intersection between the structure of the field and processes connected with the habitus adorno noted that there is a '' culture industry '' in which the mass media is involved , but that the term '' mass culture '' is inappropriate : adorno 1963 p.98 : the media culture of advanced capitalism typically creates new '' life-styles '' to drive the consumption of new commodities :
