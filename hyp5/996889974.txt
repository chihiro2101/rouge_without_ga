smith was born at baddarroch , dalmally , argyll , the eldest of three children of sarah cameron , née scott ( 29 july 1910 – 11 january 1997 ) , and archibald leitch smith ( 18 june 1907 – 1981 ) at the time of smith 's birth , his father was schoolmaster at portnahaven , islay ; however , two years later he became the headmaster of the primary school at ardrishaig , argyll , which smith went on to attend as it was a safe seat for the unionist party ( who at the time ran in place of the conservatives ) , smith came second by some distance on both occasions when callaghan became prime minister , smith became a minister of state at the privy council office , serving with labour 's deputy leader , michael foot , the lord president of the council and leader of the house of commons smith was named as parliamentarian of the year twice : first in november 1986 for his performances during the westland affair during which leon brittan resigned , and the second time in november 1989 for taking nigel lawson to task over the state of the economy and over his difficult relationship with sir alan walters , the prime minister 's economic adviser following labour 's fourth consecutive defeat at the general election of april 1992 , neil kinnock resigned as leader and smith was elected labour leader they had cut the conservative majority from 102 seats to 21 , and for most of the three years leading up to the election , opinion polls had indicated that labour were more likely to win the election than the conservatives the resignation of long-serving but increasingly unpopular conservative prime minister margaret thatcher , and the well-received election of john major as her successor , had seen the comfortable labour lead in the opinion polls wiped out and in the 17 months leading up to the election , its outcome had become much harder to predict much of the blame had been placed on labour 's '' shadow budget '' drawn up by smith , which included raising the top rate of income tax from 40p in the pound to 50p , and the conservative election campaign was centred on warning voters that they would face higher taxes under a labour government in september 1992 , smith made his maiden speech as party leader , in which he attacked the government 's erm debacle eight days earlier – an event which was seen by many observers as playing a large part in determining the outcome of the next general election , long before it was even on the political horizon , as from that point onwards the labour party was ascendant in the opinion polls , winning several seats from the conservatives in by-elections ( eventually even attracting a conservative mp to defect to labour ) and trouncing them in local council elections this echoed his attacks on major 's government made before the 1992 election ( while he was still shadow chancellor ) , most memorably when he labelled '' irresponsible '' conservative plans for cutting income tax to 20 per cent , and joked at a labour party rally in sheffield that the conservatives would have a box-office disaster with '' honey , i shrunk the economy '' – in reference to the recent disney motion picture honey , i shrunk the kids – mocking the recession which was plaguing the british economy at the time it is no wonder that we live in a country where the grand national does not start and hotels fall into the sea '' ( in reference to the 1993 grand national , which was cancelled after a false start , and to holbeck hall hotel in scarborough , which had recently collapsed off a cliff ) during the same debate , smith commented on a recent government defeat in the newbury by-election to the liberal democrats , a poor showing in the local elections and a subsequent cabinet reshuffle by saying that '' if we were to offer that tale of events to the bbc light entertainment department as a script for a programme , i think that the producers of yes minister would have turned it down as hopelessly over the top in the same speech , smith also attacked the conservatives ' broken election promises ( in particular lamont 's recent budget decision to impose vat on domestic energy bills ) – claiming he possessed the last copy of a 1992 policy document '' to escape the central office shredder '' despite his dispatch box successes ( smith was always more effective in the house of commons than on platforms or at prime minister 's questions , though he began to improve at the latter towards the end of his life ) , tony blair and gordon brown were , under smith 's leadership , restless and privately anxious that the party had adopted a '' one more heave '' approach and had become over-cautious in tackling the legacy of '' tax and spend '' despite this , during his time as leader of the labour party , smith abolished the trade union block vote at labour party conference and replaced it with '' one member , one vote '' at the 1993 party conference during smith 's tenure as leader the labour party gained a significant lead in the polls over the conservatives ; on 5 may 1994 , one week before smith 's death , the conservatives suffered a major defeat in the british council elections , their worst in over 30 years in response to his death , john major paid tribute in the house of commons to smith , culminating in the now well-known line that he and smith '' would share a drink : sometimes tea , sometimes not tea '' on 20 may 1994 , after a public funeral service in cluny parish church , edinburgh , which was attended by almost 1,000 people , smith was buried in a private family service on the island of iona , at the sacred burial ground of reilig odhráin , where many early scottish and norse kings are said to be buried tony blair , smith 's successor as leader of the labour party , was an effective campaigner who capitalised on public mistrust of the conservative party to win a landslide victory at the 1997 general election stuart argues that the lack of a '' blair effect '' would have meant that the conservative party would have held slightly over 200 seats ( rather than the 165 it actually won ) in the house of commons , leaving the conservatives in a position similar to that of labour after the 1983 general election
