the us navy used a separate designation system and at the time preferred to call similar aircraft scout bombers ( sb ) or torpedo bombers ( tb or bt ) it was not until 1946 , when the us navy and us marine corps started using the '' attack '' ( a ) designation , when it renamed bt2d skyraider and btm mauler to , respectively , ad skyraider and am mauler designation system , an attack aircraft ( a ) is designed primarily for air-to-surface ( attack : aircraft designed to find , attack , and destroy land or sea targets ) designating and naming defense military aerospace vehicles 2005 missions ( also known as '' attack missions '' ) , while a fighter category f incorporates not only aircraft designed primarily for air-to-air combat , but additionally multipurpose aircraft designed also for ground-attack missions but later they were usually classified as fighters ( '' f '' ) —possibly because ( since sukhoi su-7 ) they were similar in size and visual appearance to soviet fighters , or were simply derivatives of such other roles , including those of light bombers , medium bombers , dive bombers , reconnaissance , fighters , fighter-bombers , could and did perform air strikes on battlefields close support ground strafing ( machine gun ) and tactical bombing of infantry ( especially when moving between trenches and along roads ) , machine gun posts , artillery , and supply formations was a part of the allied armies ' strength in holding german attacks and supporting allied counter-attacks and offensives after world war i , it was widely believed that using aircraft against tactical targets was of little use other than in harassing and undermining enemy morale ; attacking combatants was generally much more dangerous to aircrews than their targets , a problem that was continually becoming more acute with the ongoing refinement of anti-aircraft weapons nevertheless , during the 1920s , the us military , in particular , procured specialized '' attack '' aircraft and formed dedicated units , that were trained primarily for that role the 1920 boeing ga-1 was an armoured twin-engine triplane for ground strafing with eight machine guns and about a ton of armour plate , and the 1922 aeromarine pg-1 was a combined pursuit ( fighter ) and ground attack design with a 37mm gun the united states army air corps was notable for its creation of a separate '' a- '' designation for attack types , distinct from and alongside '' b- '' for bomber types and '' p- '' for pursuit ( later replaced by '' f- '' for fighter ) aircraft during the 1930s , nazi germany had begun to field a class of schlacht ( '' battle '' ) aircraft , such as the henschel hs 123 though equipped with generally unsuitable designs such as the henschel hs 123 and cannon-armed versions of the heinkel he 112 , their armament and pilots proved that aircraft were a very effective weapon , even without bombs this led to some support within the luftwaffe for the creation of an aircraft dedicated to this role , resulting in tenders for a new '' attack aircraft '' this led to the introduction ( in 1942 ) of a unique single-seat , twin-engine attack aircraft , the slow-moving but heavily armored and formidably armed henschel hs 129 panzerknacker ( '' safecracker '' / '' tank cracker '' ) as world war ii approached , the concept of an attack aircraft was not well defined , and various air services used many different names for widely differing types , all performing similar roles ( sometimes in tandem with non-attack roles of bombers , fighters , reconnaissance and other roles ; army co-operation the british concept of a light aircraft mixing all the roles that required extensive communication with land forces : reconnaissance , liaison , artillery spotting , aerial supply , and , last but not least , occasional strikes on the battlefield ; light bomber during the inter-war period , the british considered that in a future war it would be france that would be the enemy in nazi germany , the luftwaffe distinguished between the stuka ( sturzkampf- , '' dive bombing '' ) units , equipped with junkers ju 87 from schlacht ( '' battle '' ) units , using strafing/low-level bombing types such as the henschel hs 123 ) ; fighter-bomber although not a synonymous class with ground-attack aircraft , fighter-bombers were usually used for the role , and proved to excel at it , even when they were only lightly armored the united states navy , in distinction to the usaaf , preferred the older term '' scout-bomber '' , under a '' sb- '' designation , such as the curtiss sb2c helldiver the british commonwealth 's desert air force , led by arthur tedder , became the first allied tactical formation to emphasise the attack role , usually in the form of single-engine hawker hurricane and curtiss p-40 fighter-bombers or specialized '' tank-busters '' , such as the hurricane mk iid , armed with two 40 & nbsp ; mm vickers s guns ( notably no nevertheless , skilled crews could be highly successful in those types , such as the leading stuka ace , hans-ulrich rudel , who claimed 500 tanks , a battleship , a cruiser , and two destroyers in 2,300 combat missions the bristol beaufighter , based on an obsolescent raf bomber , became a versatile twin-engine attack aircraft and served in almost every theatre of the war , in the maritime strike and ground attack roles as well as that of night fighter likewise the p-47 was designed and intended for use as a high altitude bomber escort , but gradually found that role filled by the north american p-51 mustang ( because of its much longer range and greater manoeuvrability ) the only other aircraft to be factory-equipped with similar guns were the 1,420 maritime strike variants of the north american b-25 mitchellg/h , which mounted either a m4 cannon , or light-weight t13e1 or m5 versions of the same gun ( except for versions of the piaggio p.108 armed with a 102mm anti-ship cannon , the bk 7,5 was unsurpassed as an aircraft-fitted gun until 1971 , when the four-engine lockheed ac-130e spectre ; equipped with a 105 & nbsp ; mm m102 howitzer & ndash ; entered service with the us air force the higher powered piston engine types that had been too late for world war ii were still capable of holding their own against the jets as they were able to both out accelerate and out manoeuver the jets although close air support and interdiction remain crucial to the modern battlefield , attack aircraft are less glamorous than fighters , while air force pilots and military planners have a certain well-cultivated contempt for '' mud-movers '' jet attack aircraft were designed and employed during the cold war era , such as the carrier-based nuclear strike douglas a-3 skywarrior and north american a-5 vigilante , while the grumman a-6 intruder , f-105 thunderchief , f-111 , f-117 nighthawk , ltv a-7 corsair ii , sukhoi su-25 , a-10 thunderbolt , panavia tornado , amx , dassault étendard , super étendard and others were designed specifically for ground-attack , strike , close support and anti-armor work , with little or no air-to-air capability ground attack has increasingly become a task of converted trainers , like the bae systems hawk or aero l-39 albatros , and many trainers are built with this task in mind , like the casa c-101 or the aermacchi mb-339 such counter-insurgency aircraft are popular with air forces which can not afford to purchase more expensive multirole aircraft , or do n't wish to risk the few such aircraft they have on light ground attack missions a proliferation of low intensity conflicts in the post-world war ii era has also expanded need for these types of aircraft to conduct counter-insurgency and light ground attack operations air force was that latter had generally been allocated all fixed-wing aircraft , while helicopters were under control of the former ; this was governed by the 1948 key west agreement the army , wishing to have its own resources to support its troops in combat and faced with a lack of air force enthusiasm for the ground-attack role , developed the dedicated attack helicopter the army is shifting its doctrine to favour ground-attack aircraft over attack helicopters for deep strike attack missions because ground-attack helicopters have proved to be highly vulnerable to small-arms fire ; the u.s in the late 1960s the united states air force requested a dedicated close air support ( cas ) plane that became the fairchild republic a-10 thunderbolt ii
