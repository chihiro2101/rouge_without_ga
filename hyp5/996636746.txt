this resulted in the entire rout of the army following his meeting with the spy and fearing that the austrian general might try to escape , bonaparte spread his army out in a wide net by sending louis desaix with divisional general jean boudet 's division ( 6,000 men ) south to novi ligure and divisional general jean françois cornu de la poype ( 3,500 men ) north on the other bank of the po the 1,200-man austrian advance guard , under colonel ( oberst ) johann maria philipp frimont and a division of 3,300 men under fml o'reilly , pushed the french outposts back and deployed to become the austrian right wing , driving the enemy from pedrabona farm , then heading south to tackle the french at la stortiglione farm 607 melas also committed a serious tactical blunder , detaching generalmajor ( gm ) nimptsch 's brigade of 2,300 hussars and two artillery batteries back over the bormida bridge to block the corps of general louis gabriel suchet , which was mistakenly reported around 9 & nbsp ; am from acqui terme to be approaching alessandria from the south the spy would advise bonaparte to march via sale on the northern side of the plain , so that he could be engaged by the austrian left wing ; meanwhile the main force would move through marengo village in the centre , turn north and fall into the french left flank the austrians planned to fight their way out eastward but—using a local double agent , usually known by his cover of françois toli—attempted to deceive bonaparte into thinking they would try to march north , cross the po and head for milan , joined by the remaining troops marching up from genoa finally , as the french position was reinforced by françois étienne de kellermann 's cavalry and jean lannes 's formation was on the way , fml ferdinand johann von morzin 's elite grenadier division was sent in to attack marengo village moreau 's victory at hohenlinden , which was the one that in reality had put an end to the war , was minimised by bonaparte who , from then on , would pose as a saviour of the fatherland , and even of the republic melas , trapped in alessandria with his hopes of breaking through to the east shattered , sent the same evening to vienna a message in which he explained that the '' charge of kellermann had broken the soldiers and this sudden and terrible change of fortunes finished by smashing the courage of the troops 63 with his army of the reserve ( officially commanded by louis alexandre berthier ) in mid-may 1800 almost before the passes were open , bonaparte ( who crossed on a mule ) had threatened melas ' lines of communications in northern italy a small part of the 6 ème légère ( 6 th light infantry regiment ) occupied castel ceriolo to the north , but soon ott 's lead units took it around 11:30 & nbsp ; am and began putting pressure on the french right flank then , chasseloup gave napoleon the founding stone , on which was inscribed : '' napoleon , emperor of the french and king of italy , to the manes of the defenders of the fatherland who perished on the day of marengo the french army then seized milan on 2 june , followed by pavia , piacenza and stradella , lombardy , cutting the main austrian supply route eastward along the south bank of the po river several participants to the fighting reveal the precarious condition of the army throughout the day , including marmont in his memoirs , captain coignet : '' we were retreating in good order but all ready to start running at the earliest sign of danger '' , captain gervais : '' in this battle , we were many times on the verge of being defeated napoleon sought to ensure that his victory would not be forgotten , so , besides the propaganda campaign , he entrusted general chasseloup with the construction of a pyramid on the site of the battle austrian headquarters debated building a bridge to the north to outflank the french , but the lack of pontoons and time forced the austrians to cross the river bormida and then launch a single , direct assault across the fontanone bridge berthier suggests that time had to be given to desaix and boudet 's division to occupy their positions : '' the enemy general misinterpreted this maneuver and thought the army was in full retreat , while in reality it was only executing a movement of conversion the three main sites of the battle formed a triangle , with marengo in the west , castel ceriolo in the north and san giuliano vecchio in the east as other french forces closed from the west and south , the austrian commander had withdrawn most of his troops from their positions near nice and genoa to alessandria on the main turin-mantua road 607–608 the second grenadier brigade under gm karl philippi von weidenfeld and some unpanicked cavalry delayed boudet 's advance long enough for o ’ reilly 's cavalry to return , and together with frimont , they mounted a last defense around marengo village as night fell , allowing the austrian centre to reach safety behind the bormida however , desaix , in charge of the force bonaparte had detached southwards , had hastened his advance and reached a small road junction north of cascina grossa ( 3 km west of san giuliano ) first , at 8 & nbsp ;

pm , and in the north , ott prepared to send fml joseph von schellenberg ’ s column to support gottesheim ott could not see any sign of the expected main french advance from sale ( to the northeast ) , so he sent gm friedrich heinrich von gottesheim ’ s reinforced advance guard to outflank lannes north of marengo kellermann 's heavy cavalry brigade and the 8 th dragoons took up a covering position on the left , smashing an attempt by gm giovanni pilatti 's light dragoon brigade which attempted to cross the steep-sided fontanone at its southern end to envelop victor 's flank boudet and the 9 ème légère ( 9th light infantry regiment ) were quickly moved on to the exit from the main vine belt , where they surprised the head of saint-julien 's column within 24 hours of the battle , melas entered into negotiations ( the convention of alessandria ) which led to the austrians evacuating northwestern italy west of the ticino river , and suspending military operations in italy lacking the large superiority in infantry and artillery enjoyed in many republican campaigns , the core of bonaparte 's reserve was 30,000 men , mostly from the batavian republic , who had been used under guillaume marie anne brune to crush the rebellion in the vendée 149 on the austrian left , 7,500 men under fml peter ott waited for the road to clear before heading for the village of castel ceriolo well to the north of the french positions 146 the movement began about 6 & nbsp ;
