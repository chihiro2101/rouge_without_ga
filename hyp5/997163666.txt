by this , hobbes does not mean hell ( he did not believe in hell or purgatory ) chapter xlvi : lastly , for the errors brought in from false or uncertain history , what is all the legend of fictitious miracles in the lives of the saints ; and all the histories of apparitions and ghosts alleged by the doctors of the roman church , to make good their doctrines of hell and purgatory , the power of exorcism , and other doctrines which have no warrant , neither in reason nor scripture ; as also all those traditions which they call the unwritten word of god ; but old wives ' fables ? , but the darkness of ignorance as opposed to the light of true knowledge hobbes finishes by inquiring who benefits from the errors he diagnoses : : cicero maketh honourable mention of one of the cassii , a severe judge amongst the romans , for a custom he had in criminal causes , when the testimony of the witnesses was not sufficient , to ask the accusers , cui bono ; that is to say , what profit , honour , or other contentment the accused obtained or expected by the fact there is no doubt but they were made laws by god himself : but because a law obliges not , nor is law to any but to them that acknowledge it to be the act of the sovereign , how could the people of israel , that were forbidden to approach the mountain to hear what god said to moses , be obliged to obedience to all those laws which moses propounded to them ? '' and concludes , as before , that '' making of the scripture law , belonged to the civil sovereign the need ( as hobbes saw it ) for the civil sovereign to be supreme arose partly from the many sects that arose around the civil war , and to quash the pope of rome 's challenge , to which hobbes devotes an extensive section hobbes then goes on to criticize what he sees as many of the practices of catholicism : '' now for the worship of saints , and icons , and relics , and other things at this day practiced in the church of rome , i say they are not allowed by the word of god '' and therefore '' the question truly stated is : by what authority they are made law ? '' unsurprisingly , hobbes concludes that ultimately there is no way to determine this other than the civil power : he discusses the ten commandments , and asks '' who it was that gave to these written tables the obligatory force of laws '' however , hobbes is quite happy for the truth to be suppressed if necessary : if '' they tend to disorder in government , as countenancing rebellion or sedition ? then let them be silenced , and the teachers punished '' – but only by the civil authority '' finally : '' we are to consider now what office in the church those persons have who , being civil sovereigns , have embraced also the christian faith ? '' to which the answer is : '' christian kings are still the supreme pastors of their people , and have power to ordain what pastors they please , to teach the church , that is , to teach the people committed to their charge so , hobbes says , we need a test : and the true test is established by examining the books of scripture , and is : '' seeing therefore miracles now cease '' means that only the books of the bible can be trusted the purpose of a commonwealth is given at the start of part ii : the commonwealth is instituted when all agree in the following manner : i authorise and give up my right of governing myself to this man , or to this assembly of men , on this condition ; that thou give up , thy right to him , and authorise all his actions in like manner however , the succession is definitely in the gift of the monarch : but , it is not always obvious who the monarch has appointed : however , the answer is : and this means : note that ( perhaps rather radically ) this does not have to be any blood relative : however , practically this means : ( due to disagreements over the precise location of the chapters and verses when they were divided in the late middle ages , the verse hobbes quotes is usually given as job 41:33 in modern christian translations into english , job 41:25 in the masoretic text , septuagint , and the luther bible ; it is job 41:24 in the vulgate the second law of nature is that one ought to be willing to renounce one 's right to all things where others are willing to do the same , to quit the state of nature , and to erect a commonwealth with the authority to command them in all things given human nature , the variability of human desires , and need for scarce resources to fulfill those desires , the state of nature , as hobbes calls this anarchic condition , must be a war of all against all hobbes has little time for the various disputing sects of philosophers and objects to what people have taken '' from aristotle 's civil philosophy , they have learned to call all manner of commonwealths but the popular ( such as was at that time the state of athens ) , tyranny '' in contrast to the simply informative titles usually given to works of early modern political philosophy , such as john locke 's two treatises of government or hobbes 's own earlier work the elements of law , hobbes selected a more poetic name for this more provocative treatise because the covenant forming the commonwealth results from social contract , the sovereign can not possibly breach the covenant ; and therefore the subjects can never argue to be freed from the covenant because of the actions of the sovereign the giant holds the symbols of both sides , reflecting the union of secular , and spiritual in the sovereign , but the construction of the torso also makes the figure the state '' samuel mintz suggests that these connotations lend themselves to hobbes 's understanding of political force since both '' leviathan and hobbes 's sovereign are unities compacted out of separate individuals ; they are omnipotent ; they can not be destroyed or divided ; they inspire fear in men ; they do not make pacts with men ; theirs is the dominion of power '' on pain of death the leviathan in the state theory of thomas hobbes – meaning and failure of a political symbol , chicago : the university of chicago press , 2008 ( earlier : greenwood press , 1996 ) the equality of taxes does n't depend on equality of wealth , but on the equality of the debt that every man owes to the commonwealth for his defence and the maintenance of the rule of law hobbes presents his own religious theory but states that he would defer to the will of the sovereign ( when that was re-established : again , leviathan was written during the civil war ) as to whether his theory was acceptable lexicography in the early modern period believed that the term '' leviathan '' was associated with the hebrew words lavah , meaning '' to couple , connect , or join '' , and thannin , meaning '' a serpent or dragon '' hobbes concludes part one by articulating an additional seventeen laws of nature that make the performance of the first two possible and by explaining what it would mean for a sovereign to represent the people even when they disagree with the sovereign in it , a giant crowned figure is seen emerging from the landscape , clutching a sword and a crosier , beneath a quote from the book of job— '' non est potestas super terram quae comparetur ei leviathan : or the matter , forme , and power of a commonwealth ecclesiasticall and civill , ed because the purpose of the commonwealth is peace , and the sovereign has the right to do whatever he thinks necessary for the preserving of peace and security and prevention of discord he presents an image of man as matter in motion , attempting to show through example how everything about humanity can be explained materialistically , that is , without recourse to an incorporeal , immaterial soul or a faculty for understanding ideas that are external to the human mind however , once hobbes ' initial argument is accepted ( that no-one can know for sure anyone else 's divine revelation ) his conclusion ( the religious power is subordinate to the civil ) follows from his logic
