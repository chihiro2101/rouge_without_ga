the house was then owned by thomas fitton , who had inherited it by marriage in 1316 , and it remained in the possession of the fitton family until 1611 it is considered by the architectural historians peter de & nbsp ; figueiredo and julian treuherz that the site of the house was originally moated , and that its plan was that of a quadrangle , forming a courtyard house sir edward iii was the father of mary fitton , a maid of honour to queen elizabeth and a candidate for the '' dark lady '' of shakespeare 's sonnets following the death of sir & nbsp ; edward fitton , 2nd & nbsp ; baronet in 1643 , the estate passed to sir & nbsp ; charles gerard , later the first earl of macclesfield there was a dispute about the legal ownership of the estate between sir & nbsp ; charles and his cousin alexander fitton , which was resolved in sir charles 's favour in 1663 demolition of parts of the house took place in about 1700 , and it is thought by de & nbsp ; figueiredo and treuherz that the west range was removed , possibly including the gatehouse at the beginning of the 18th & nbsp ; century the dispute between the fittons and the gerards resurfaced , culminating in a duel in hyde park , london , in 1712 between the rival claimants : lord mohun , from the gerard family , and the 4th & nbsp ; duke of hamilton , from the fittons the estate remained with the gerards , until it was bought by william stanhope , who later became the first earl of harrington , and it remained with this family until 1935 richards collected items from historic buildings that were being demolished in the 1960s , either incorporating them into the house or displaying them in the grounds the long hall was originally the great hall , and was open to the roof , but is now divided into two floors de & nbsp ; figueiredo and treuherz are of the opinion that this was originally a larger , separate structure , probably a barn , and incorporated into the main building when the east range was built it contains the coat of arms of the richards family and items of weaponry , including a decorative suit of armour dating from the 19th & nbsp ; century and moved here from scarisbrick hall to the west of this is the drawing room , the principal living room of the hall , which has been little altered since the middle of the 16th & nbsp ; century a staircase from the east of the guard room leads to the gallery on the upper floor , to the south side of which is the solar , containing a 16th-century four-poster bed known as the boswell bed it contains a four-poster bed from the era of william and mary and a portrait by zuccaro of members of the fitton family , which was formerly in brereton hall a room next to the hall room has been converted into a modern bathroom , next to which is mary fitton 's bedroom , which contains an old plaster frieze associated with the house is an inner garden of about surrounded by a parkland of about ; both are enclosed by walls that claim is repeated in the hall 's official guidebook , which goes on to suggest that it was created in the hope that elizabeth i of england would visit the hall on her royal entry , but she never did so there is some doubt regarding the dating of the creation of the garden , but it is generally accepted that it comprised an elizabethan pleasure garden four structures in the grounds around the hall are recorded in the national heritage list for england as a designated grade & nbsp ; ii listed buildings ; grade & nbsp ; ii listing means that a building or structure is considered to be '' of special interest '' in nearby woodland are the grave and memorial to samuel '' maggoty '' johnson , a playwright said to have been the last professional jester in england , who lived in the hall and died in 1773 aged 82 immediately to the west is the grade & nbsp ; i listed church of st james , to the north beyond a fish pond is the grade & nbsp ; ii listed gawsworth new hall , and nearby is the grade & nbsp ; i listed gawsworth old rectory grade & nbsp ; i listing is granted to buildings of '' exceptional interest , sometimes considered to be internationally important '' , and encompasses only 2.5 & nbsp ; percent of all listed buildings the grounds have been designated grade & nbsp ; ii in the national register of historic parks and gardens
