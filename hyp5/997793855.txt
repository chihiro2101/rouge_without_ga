the world health organization definition of diabetes ( both type & nbsp ; 1 and type & nbsp ; 2 ) is for a single raised glucose reading with symptoms , otherwise raised values on two occasions , of either : fasting plasma glucose ≥ 7.0 & nbsp ; mmol/l ( 126 & nbsp ; mg/dl ) : or with a glucose tolerance test , two hours after the oral dose a plasma glucose ≥ 11.1 & nbsp ; mmol/l ( 200 & nbsp ; mg/dl ) a random blood sugar of greater than 11.1 & nbsp ; mmol/l ( 200 & nbsp ; mg/dl ) in association with typical symptoms or a glycated hemoglobin ( hba 1c ) of ≥ & nbsp ; 48 & nbsp ; mmol/mol ( ≥ & nbsp ; 6.5 dcct % ) is another method of diagnosing diabetes if the diagnosis is in doubt antibody testing may be useful to confirm type & nbsp ; 1 diabetes and c-peptide levels may be useful to confirm type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes , with c-peptide levels normal or high in type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes , but low in type & nbsp ; 1 diabetes type & nbsp ; 1 and type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes were identified as separate conditions for the first time by the indian physicians sushruta and charaka in 400–500 & nbsp ; ad with type & nbsp ; 1 associated with youth and type & nbsp ; 2 with being overweight other potentially important mechanisms associated with type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes and insulin resistance include : increased breakdown of lipids within fat cells , resistance to and lack of incretin , high glucagon levels in the blood , increased retention of salt and water by the kidneys , and inappropriate regulation of metabolism by the central nervous system in 2009 an international expert committee that included representatives of the american diabetes association ( ada ) , the international diabetes federation ( idf ) , and the european association for the study of diabetes ( easd ) recommended that a threshold of ≥ & nbsp ; 48 & nbsp ; mmol/mol ( ≥ & nbsp ; 6.5 dcct % ) should be used to diagnose diabetes the goal of treatment is typically an hba 1c of 7 to 8 % or a fasting glucose of less than 7.2 & nbsp ; mmol/l ( 130 & nbsp ; mg/dl ) ; however these goals may be changed after professional clinical consultation , taking into account particular risks of hypoglycemia and life expectancy this is in contrast to type 1 diabetes in which there is an absolute insulin deficiency due to destruction of islet cells in the pancreas and gestational diabetes that is a new onset of high blood sugars associated with pregnancy the five countries with the greatest number of people with diabetes as of 2000 are india having 31.7 & nbsp ; million , china 20.8 & nbsp ; million , the united states 17.7 & nbsp ; million , indonesia 8.4 & nbsp ; million , and japan 6.8 & nbsp ; million this is partly due to a number of complications with which it is associated , including : two to four times the risk of cardiovascular disease , including ischemic heart disease and stroke ; a 20-fold increase in lower limb amputations , and increased rates of hospitalizations high-risk groups in the united states include : those over 45 years old ; those with a first degree relative with diabetes ; some ethnic groups , including hispanics , african-americans , and native-americans ; a history of gestational diabetes ; polycystic ovary syndrome ; excess weight ; and conditions associated with metabolic syndrome globally as of 2015 it was estimated that there were 392 & nbsp ; million people with type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes making up about 90 % of diabetes cases a small number of people with type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes can develop a hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state ( a condition of very high blood sugar associated with a decreased level of consciousness and hypotension ) lifestyle factors are important to the development of type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes , including obesity and being overweight ( defined by a body mass index of greater than 25 ) , lack of physical activity , poor diet , stress , and urbanization rates of diabetes in 1985 were estimated at 30 & nbsp ; million , increasing to 135 & nbsp ; million in 1995 and 217 & nbsp ; million in 2005 self-monitoring of blood glucose for people with newly diagnosed type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes may be used in combination with education , although the benefit of self-monitoring in those not using multi-dose insulin is questionable despite guidelines recommending that intensive blood sugar control be based on balancing immediate harms with long-term benefits , many people & nbsp ; – for example people with a life expectancy of less than nine years who will not benefit , are over-treated the proportion of insulin resistance versus beta cell dysfunction differs among individuals , with some having primarily insulin resistance and only a minor defect in insulin secretion and others with slight insulin resistance and primarily a lack of insulin secretion excess body fat is associated with 30 % of cases in those of chinese and japanese descent , 60–80 % of cases in those of european and african descent , and 100 % of cases in pima indians and pacific islanders 2015 american diabetes association recommendations for aspirin use ( based on expert consensus or clinical experience ) are that low-dose aspirin use is reasonable in adults with diabetes who are at intermediate risk of cardiovascular disease ( 10-year cardiovascular disease risk , 5–10 % ) insulin resistance , which is the inability of cells to respond adequately to normal levels of insulin , occurs primarily within the muscles , liver , and fat tissue more than 36 & nbsp ; genes and 80 & nbsp ; single-nucleotide polymorphism ( snps ) had been found that contribute to the risk of type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes there are a number of rare cases of diabetes that arise due to an abnormality in a single gene ( known as monogenic forms of diabetes or diabetes mellitus other types ) in the developed world , and increasingly elsewhere , type & nbsp ; 2 & nbsp ; diabetes is the largest cause of nontraumatic blindness and kidney failure while some of these factors are under personal control , such as diet and obesity , other factors are not , such as increasing age , female gender , and genetics a 2016 systematic review found potential harm to treating to targets lower than 140 mmhg , and a subsequent review in 2019 found no evidence of additional benefit from blood pressure lowering to between 130 - 140mmhg , although there was an increased risk of adverse events type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes is now diagnosed as frequently as type & nbsp ; 1 diabetes in teenagers in the united states in those with impaired glucose tolerance , diet and exercise either alone or in combination with metformin or acarbose may decrease the risk of developing diabetes the classic symptoms of diabetes are frequent urination ( polyuria ) , increased thirst ( polydipsia ) , increased hunger ( polyphagia ) , and weight loss threshold for diagnosis of diabetes is based on the relationship between results of glucose tolerance tests , fasting glucose or hba 1c and complications such as retinopathy management of type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes focuses on lifestyle interventions , lowering other cardiovascular risk factors , and maintaining blood glucose levels in the normal range 2015 american diabetes association recommendations are that people with diabetes and albuminuria should receive an inhibitor of the renin-angiotensin system to reduce the risks of progression to end-stage renal disease , cardiovascular events , and death there is some evidence that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors ( aceis ) are superior to other inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system such as angiotensin receptor blockers ( arbs ) , or aliskiren in preventing cardiovascular disease the long acting insulins glargine and detemir are equally safe and effective , and do not appear much better than neutral protamine hagedorn nph insulin , but as they are significantly more expensive , they are not cost effective as of 2010
