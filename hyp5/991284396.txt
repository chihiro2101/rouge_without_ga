petroleum prehistoric to petrochemicals , g.a.purdy 1957 , copp clark publishing company , vancouver , toronto , montreal , p.312 and 342 the particular mixtures in use today are the same as when they were first developed in the 1940s , and were used in airline and military aero engines with high levels of supercharger ; notably the rolls-royce merlin engine used in the spitfire and hurricane fighters , mosquito fighter-bomber and lancaster heavy bomber ( the merlin ii and later versions required 100-octane fuel ) , as well as the liquid-cooled allison v-1710 engine , and air-cooled radial engines from pratt & whitney , wright , and other manufacturers on both sides of the atlantic ) because tetraethyllead is a toxic additive , the minimum amount needed to bring the fuel to the required octane rating is used ; actual concentrations are often lower than the permissible maximum historically , many post-wwii developed , low-powered 4- and 6-cylinder piston aircraft engines were designed to use leaded fuels ; a suitable unleaded replacement fuel has not yet been developed and certified for most of these engines however , all of their engines require that an oil additive be used when unleaded fuel is used : '' when using the unleaded fuels identified in table 1 , lycoming oil additive p/n lw-16702 , or an equivalent finished product such as aeroshell 15w-50 , must be used '' lycoming also notes that the octane rating of the fuel used must also meet the requirements stated in the fuel specification , otherwise engine damage may occur due to detonation meanwhile , teledyne continental motors indicates ( in document x30548r3 most recently revised in 2008 ) that leaded avgas is required in their engines : '' current aircraft engines feature valve gear components which are designed for compatibility with the leaded astm d910 fuels however , prices are so high that there have been efforts to convert to diesel fuel , which is more readily available , less expensive , and has advantages for aviation use the first number indicates the octane rating of the fuel tested to '' aviation lean '' standards , which is similar to the anti-knock index or '' pump rating '' given to automotive gasoline in the us the second number indicates the octane rating of the fuel tested to the '' aviation rich '' standard , which tries to simulate a supercharged condition with a rich mixture , elevated temperatures , and a high manifold pressure for example , 100/130 avgas has an octane rating of 100 at the lean settings usually used for cruising and 130 at the rich settings used for take-off and other full-power conditions the 100ll phase-out has been called '' one of modern ga 's most pressing problems '' , because 70 % of 100ll aviation fuel is used by the 30 % of the aircraft in the general aviation fleet that can not use any of the existing alternatives in february 2008 , teledyne continental motors ( tcm ) announced that the company is very concerned about future availability of 100ll , and as a result , they would develop a line of diesel engines in a february 2008 interview , tcm president rhett ross indicated belief that the aviation industry will be '' forced out '' of using 100ll in the near future , leaving automotive fuel and jet fuel as the only alternatives in june 2010 , clubs such as the american bonanza society , the malibu mirage owners and pilots association , and the cirrus owners and pilots association collectively formed the clean 100 octane coalition to represent them on this issue and push for unleaded 100 octane avgas ul94 is not intended to be a full replacement for 100ll but rather is designed to be a drop-in replacement for aircraft with lower-octane-rated engines , such as those that are approved for operation on grade 80 avgas ( or lower ) , ul91 , or mogas ul94 has a minimum motor octane number ( mon , which is the octane rating employed for grading aviation gasoline ) of 94.0 automotive gasoline ( typical values at the pump can include 87 , 89 , 91 , and 93 ) , and also the 93ul fuel from airworthy autogas concurrent with the addition of ul94 to astm d7547 , the faa published special airworthiness information bulletin ( saib ) hq-16-05 , which states that '' ul94 meets the operating limitations or aircraft and engines approved to operate with grade ul91 avgas , '' meaning that '' grade ul94 avgas that meets specification d7547 is acceptable to use on those aircraft and engines that are approved to operate with.grade ul91 avgas that meets specification d7547 '' in august 2016 , the faa revised saib hq-16-05 to include similar wording regarding the acceptability of using ul94 in aircraft and engines that are approved to operate with avgas that has a minimum motor octane rating of 80 or lower , including grade 80/87 the publication of the saib , especially the august 2016 revision , eliminated the need for many of the ul94 stcs being sold by swift fuels , as the majority of the aircraft on the stc 's approved model list are type-certified to use 80-octane or lower avgas on april 6 , 2017 , lycoming engines published service instruction 1070v , which adds ul94 as an approved grade of fuel for dozens of engine models , 60 % of which are carbureted engines the faa found swift fuel to have a motor octane number of 104.4 , 96.3 % of the energy per unit of mass , and 113 % of the energy per unit of volume as 100ll , and to meet most of the astm d910 standard for leaded aviation fuel the united states environmental protection agency ( epa ) has noted that exposure to even very low levels of lead contamination has been conclusively linked to loss of iq in children 's brain function tests , thus providing a high degree of motivation to eliminate lead and its compounds from the environment the new standard requires the 16,000 remaining usa sources of lead , which include lead smelting , airplane fuels , military installations , mining and metal smelting , iron and steel manufacturing , industrial boilers and process heaters , hazardous waste incineration , and production of batteries , to reduce their emissions by october 2011 at an epa public consultation held in june 2008 on the new standards , andy cebula , the aircraft owners and pilots association 's executive vice president of government affairs , stated that general aviation plays a valuable role in the usa economy and any changes in lead standards that would change the current composition of avgas would have a '' direct impact on the safety of flight and the very future of light aircraft in this country '' the epa indicated : '' this action will describe the lead inventory related to use of leaded avgas , air quality and exposure information , additional information the agency is collecting related to the impact of lead emissions from piston-engine aircraft on air quality and will request comments on this information '' despite assertions in the media that leaded avgas will be eliminated in the us by 2017 at the latest date , the epa confirmed in july 2010 that there is no phase-out date and that setting one would be an faa responsibility as the epa has no authority over avgas in april 2011 at sun ' n fun , pete bunce , head of the general aviation manufacturers association ( gama ) , and craig fuller , president and ceo of the aircraft owners and pilots association , indicated that they both are confident that leaded avgas will not be eliminated until a suitable replacement is in place
