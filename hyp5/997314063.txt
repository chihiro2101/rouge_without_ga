battalions and 58 squadrons organized into five divisions under prince von fürstemberg , johann mészáros von szoboszló , johann sigismund riesch , karl von riese , and sztáray with desaix on the left and saint-cyr on the right , moreau pressed north up the east bank of the rhine to the murg river the french thrust severed austrians under fröhlich and french royalists under louis joseph , prince of condé from the remainder of latour 's army despite having won the battle on his right flank , charles feared saint-cyr 's advance might cut him off from his supply base at heilbronn so the archduke ordered a retreat to the east the swabians and bavarian began negotiations with the french to quit the war while the saxons marched away to the north to join wartensleben 's army when charles left the banks of the rhine he left behind 30,000 troops in garrisons at mannheim , philippsburg , mainz , königstein im taunus and ehrenbreitstein fortress on 13 july in desaix 's left wing , the division of

line archduke charles wished to prevent the army of moreau from joining with his colleague jean-baptiste jourdan and the army of sambre-et-meuse the austrian commander hoped to withdraw to the south bank of the danube but the army of rhin-et-moselle was following too closely by attacking moreau , the archduke hoped to push the french back in order to prevent their two armies from merging and to give his own troops enough room to cross the danube safely also , he wanted to lure moreau into crossing the danube and separating himself from jourdan he sent one column to cross to the north bank of the danube at günzburg to get behind the french right flank on the left flank , fröhlich was in charge of the force that would cross the danube behind the french right flank 323 once they crushed the french right flank , 3,000 men under karl mercandin were to attack dischingen while the rest were supposed to circle behind moreau 's army and keep it from escaping saint-cyr 's light cavalry , led by étienne marie antoine champion de nansouty , lost heart at seeing the heavy cavalry fleeing and fell back , leaving the french infantry at eglingen without support before riding off to consult with desaix , the french army commander placed bourcier 's division in support nearby and agreed to have the left wing attack the austrian right flank though saint-cyr was in a tight spot , in fact , charles became anxious about moreau 's commitment of the french reserve charles hoped that moreau might concede defeat , but the morning of 12 august found the french army still in position according to one source that called the battle a french victory , the austrians lost 1,100 killed and wounded plus 500 captured while the french suffered 1,200 killed and wounded plus 1,200 captured the austrian retreat was not molested by the french , which was one of the reasons why charles fought the battle charles entertained a desire to combine forces with wartensleben at the earliest opportunity in order to defeat jourdan 's army when charles withdrew to the south bank of the danube , he left moreau free to stay on the north bank and join with jourdan on 18 and 19 august moreau 's army finally crossed to the south bank of the danube leaving latour with 30,288 troops plus condé 's 5,000-6,000 men , charles and 28,000 troops recrossed to the north bank , heading for a rendezvous with wartensleben 296 the next actions were the battle of amberg and the battle of friedberg , both on 24 august 1796
