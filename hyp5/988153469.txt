'' finally , it stipulated that neither signatory would ever '' occupy , or fortify , or colonize , or assume or exercise any dominion over nicaragua , costa rica , the mosquito coast or any part of central america '' , nor make use of any protectorate or alliance , present or future , to such ends the treaty was signed on april 19 , 1850 , and was ratified by both governments , but before the exchange of ratifications the british prime minister lord palmerston , on june 8 , directed bulwer to make a '' declaration '' that the british government did not understand the treaty '' as applying to her majesty 's settlement at honduras , or its dependencies nor the small islands in the neighborhood of that settlement which may be known as its dependencies '' ; that the treaty 's engagements did apply to all the central american states , '' with their just limits and proper dependencies '' ( referring to the mosquito coast and the bay islands ) ; and that these declarations , not being submitted to the united states senate , would in no way affect the legality of the treaty the phraseology reflects the effort made by the united states to render impossible ownership of the canal by the united kingdom through the territory held by the british at its mouth , just as the explicit prohibitions of the treaty rendered impossible such control politically by either power the united kingdom contended that the excepted '' settlement '' at honduras was the '' belize '' covered by the furthest british claim ; that the bay islands were a dependency of belize ; and that , as for the mosquito coast , the abnegatory clauses being wholly prospective in intent , britain was not required to abandon her protectorate the united states asserted that the bay islands were not the '' dependencies '' of belize , which were the small neighboring islands mentioned in the same treaties , and nothing else ; that the excepted '' settlement '' was the british-honduras of definite extent and narrow purpose recognized in british treaties with spain ; that the united states had not confirmed by recognition the large , indefinite and offensive claims whose dangers the treaty was primarily designed to lessen ; and that , as to the mosquito coast , the treaty was retrospective , and mutual in the rigor of its requirements the claims to a part of belize and the bay islands were very old in origin , but were heavily clouded by interruptions of possession , contested interpretations of spanish-british treaties , and active controversy with the central american states binding both nations not to '' occupy '' any part of central america or the mosquito coast necessitated the abandonment of british colonies and protectorates in central america , and the united states government demanded the british completely abandon their central american colonies and protectorates , which britain demurred in doing so in regards to belize , the american diplomatic arguments were stronger ; as regards to the mosquito coast , disregard the fact that the protectorate was recognized by the treaty , do demand its absolute abandonment was unwarranted , although to satisfy the treaty britain was bound materially to weaken it and also to give grant to the hay–sasha treaty 1923 the arguments advanced on its behalf were quite indefensible in law and history , and although the position of the united states in 1850–1860 was in general the stronger in history , law and political ethics , that of the united kingdom was even more conspicuously the stronger in the years 1880–1884
