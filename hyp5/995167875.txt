prior to the introduction of the bulletin board system ( bbs ) , modems typically operated on direct-dial telephone lines that always began and ended with a known modem at each end when automation was required , it was commonly only needed on the answer side & nbsp ; — for instance , a bank might need to take calls from a number of branch offices for end-of-day processing another solution would have been to use a separate set of '' command pins '' dedicated to sending and receiving commands , another could have used a signal pin indicating that the modem should interpret incoming data as a command the pause at the end of the escape sequence was required to reduce the problem caused by in-band signaling : if any other data was received within one second of the three plus signs , it was not the escape sequence and would be sent as data in actual use many of the commands automatically switched to the online mode after completion , and it is rare for a user to use the online command explicitly this had a major denial of service security implication in that it would lead to the modem hanging up the connection should the computer ever try to transmit the byte sequence '' +++ath0 '' in data mode for any computer connected to the internet through such a modem , this could be easily exploited by sending it a ping of death request containing the sequence '' +++ath0 '' in the payload it also includes various controls to set up the modem , including a set of register commands which allowed the user to directly set the various memory locations in the original hayes modem the command set was copied largely verbatim , including the meaning of the registers , by almost all early 300 baud modem manufacturers , of which there were quite a few the expansion to 1200 and 2400 baud required the addition of a small set of new commands , some of them prefixed with an ampersand ( '' & '' ) to denote those dedicated to new functionality frank durda iv , '' the at command set reference - history '' , 1993 essentially by accident , this allowed users of existing 1200 baud modems to use the new hayes 2400 models without changing their software the hayes command set can subdivide into four groups : basic command set & nbsp ; – a capital character followed by a digit extended command set & nbsp ; – an '' & '' ( ampersand ) and a capital character followed by a digit register commands & nbsp ; – sr n where r is the number of the register to be changed , and n is the new value that is assigned the normal escape sequence is three plus signs ( '' +++ '' ) , and to disambiguate it from possible real data , a guard timer is used : it must be preceded by a pause , not have any pauses between the plus signs , and be followed by a pause ; by default , a '' pause '' is one second and '' no pause '' is anything less in at commands which do not store the values of any of their subparameters , and so have not a read command , which are called action type commands , the action should be done on the basis of the recommended default setting of the subparameter some recent high speed modems provide a virtual ethernet interface instead of using a point-to-point protocol ( ppp ) for the data connection because of performance reasons ( ppp connection is only used between the computer and the modem , not over network ) list of at commands : basic ( hayes ) , extended , proprietary hayes at command reference manual a list of hayes at commands 3gpp.org , 3gpp at command set for user equipment modem initialisation string extended hayes at command parameters for sms ( dead ) determining your class of fax / modem openmoko : at commands cell modem commands itu standard v.250 at commands reference guide from telit ( dead )
