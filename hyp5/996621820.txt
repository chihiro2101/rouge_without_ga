curry 's paradox uses a particular kind of self-referential conditional sentence , as demonstrated in this example : even though germany does not border china , the example sentence certainly is a natural-language sentence , and so the truth of that sentence can be analyzed because the proof uses only well-accepted methods of deduction , and because none of these methods appears to be incorrect , this situation is paradoxical the standard method for proving conditional sentences ( sentences of the form '' if a , then b '' ) is called a '' conditional proof '' in this method , in order to prove '' if a , then b '' , first a is assumed and then with that assumption b is shown to be true to produce curry 's paradox , as described in the two steps above , apply this method to the sentence '' if this sentence is true , then germany borders china '' therefore , in assuming a , we have assumed both a and '' if a , then b '' now , because we have proved '' if this sentence is true , then 'germany borders china ' is true '' , then we can again apply modus ponens , because we know that the claim '' this sentence is true '' is correct in this context , it shows that if we assume there is a formal sentence ( x → y ) , where x itself is equivalent to ( x → y ) , then we can prove y with a formal proof therefore , if y is an unprovable statement in a formal system , there is no statement x in that system such that x is equivalent to the implication ( x → y ) even if the underlying mathematical logic does not admit any self-referential sentences , certain forms of naive set theory are still vulnerable to curry 's paradox when translating expressions from mathematics to lambda calculus , the domain of lambda calculus terms is not always isomorphic to the domain of the mathematical expressions the translation of eval ( s ) into mathematics is so where s '' eval ( s ) → y '' , if y is false , then the x x → y is false , but this is a falsehood , not a paradox the following theorem is easily proved and represents such a naming : in the above statement the formula a is named as x the order of the quantifiers may be reversed using skolemization : however , now instantiation gives which is not the starting point for the proof and does not lead to a contradiction russell 's paradox girard 's paradox kleene–rosser paradox liar paradox list of paradoxes richard 's paradox zermelo–fraenkel set theory fixed-point combinator deductive lambda calculus let expression
