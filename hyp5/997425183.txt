one way to search for a fifth force is with tests of the strong equivalence principle : this is one of the most powerful tests of einstein 's theory of gravity : general relativity this is because gravitational interactions , in theories other than general relativity , have degrees of freedom other than the '' metric '' , which dictates the curvature of space , and different kinds of degrees of freedom produce different effects another kind of fifth force , which arises in kaluza–klein theory , where the universe has extra dimensions , or in supergravity or string theory is the yukawa force , which is transmitted by a light scalar field ( i.e the above experiments search for a fifth force that is , like gravity , independent of the composition of an object , so all objects experience the force in proportion to their masses such forces may depend , for example , on the ratio of protons to neutrons in an atomic nucleus , nuclear spin , or the relative amount of different kinds of binding energy in a nucleus ( see the semi-empirical mass formula ) searches have been done from very short ranges , to municipal scales , to the scale of the earth , the sun , and dark matter at the center of the galaxy they point out that dark matter and dark energy are unexplained by the standard model of particle physics and suggest that some modification of gravity is necessary , possibly arising from modified newtonian dynamics or the holographic principle most physicists , however , think that dark matter and dark energy are not ad hoc , but are supported by a large number of complementary experiments and described by a very simple model excess decays were observed at an opening angle of 140° between the e + and e − , and a combined energy of 17 & nbsp ; mev , which indicated that a small fraction of beryllium-8 will shed excess energy in the form of a new particle this was reported through science journalism , focusing largely on the implications that the existence of the x17 particle and a corresponding fifth force would have in the search for dark matter speaking to the independent , krasznahorkay said '' if the particle ’ s existence is confirmed , it means physicists will have to finally reassess the interactions of the existing four fundamental forces of particle physics and make space for a fifth
