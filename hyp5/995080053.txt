the trent and mersey canal ( t & m ) was built to link the river trent at derwent mouth in derbyshire to the river mersey , and thereby provide an inland route between the major ports of hull and liverpool in 1760 , lord gower , a local businessman and brother-in-law of the duke of bridgewater , drew up a plan for the trent and mersey canal james brindley , the engineer behind many of the canals in england , did his first canal work on the trent and mersey , though his first job in charge of construction was on the bridgewater canal john gilbert 's plan for the '' grand trunk '' canal met opposition at the eastern end where , in burton on trent , the locals objected to the canal passing parallel to the upper trent navigation '' six years before the complete opening of the trent and mersey canal in 1771 , wedgwood built the factory village of etruria on the outskirts of stoke-on-trent , close to the canal the grand trunk was a part of a larger scheme of james brindley 's to link the four main rivers of england ( trent , mersey , severn and thames ) in a project known as the '' grand cross '' the trent and mersey canal provided the northwestern arm of the cross ( to the mersey ) , and the northeastern arm ( to the trent ) on the cheshire stretch of the canal , between middlewich and the northern end of the canal in preston brook tunnel , is the victorian anderton boat lift , which lowers boats fifty feet from the t & m to the river weaver the northern end of the canal makes an end-on junction with the bridgewater canal within preston brook tunnel , from which one can access runcorn ( but no longer the mersey or ship canal ) in one direction and manchester ( with its many canal links ) in the other direction after anderton , the next major destination is middlewich , where a junction with the wardle canal leads to the middlewich branch of the shropshire union canal which gives access to chester , llangollen and ( heading south on the shropshire union ) a parallel route to birmingham via wolverhampton south of middlewich , having passed through wheelock , the t & m climbs out of the cheshire plain via the 'heartbreak hill ' locks ( more traditionally known as the 'cheshire locks ' ) to the summit-level and the junction with the hall green branch , leading to the macclesfield canal at red bull kidsgrove the boater can use the macclesfield canal to head for marple , and the junction with the peak forest canal ( and hence , via the ashton , rochdale and bridgewater canal ) to complete the 'cheshire ring ' after the harecastle tunnel ( one way , alternating roughly every two hours ) , the canal emerges in the outskirts of stoke-on-trent , and is soon in the middle of the city and then at etruria , and the junction with the caldon canal the coventry soon leads to the birmingham and fazeley canal and branches off to birmingham or ( via another stretch of the coventry canal ) to coventry and a junction with the oxford canal and thence to the thames and the 'southern half ' of the english canals the canal now heads directly to its terminus , passing through burton upon trent , mercia marina at findern , the largest inland waterway marina in the united kingdom , and then through wide locks ( the first being at stenson ) to shardlow and finally derwent mouth it is not far from derwent mouth , via the river trent , to trentlock , the four-way junction with the erewash canal ( dead end at great northern basin , formerly a link with the cromford canal ) , cranfleet cut ( bypassing thrumpton weir to continue navigation towards nottingham ) and the river soar navigation ( linking via leicester to the grand union canal )
