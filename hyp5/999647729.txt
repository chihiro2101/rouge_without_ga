from july 1824 to september 1825 , the last surviving french general of the revolutionary war , the marquis de lafayette , made a famous tour of the 24 states in the united states shortly before she was to be launched in the spring of 1825 , president john quincy adams decided to have an american warship carry the marquis de lafayette back to europe , in the wake of his visit to the land he had fought to free almost 50 years before adams selected susquehanna for this honor , and accordingly—as a gesture of the nation 's affection for lafayette—the frigate was renamed brandywine to commemorate the battle of brandywine , in which lafayette was wounded fighting with american forces as an honor to the marquis , officers were selected from as many states as possible and , where practicable , from descendants of persons who had distinguished themselves in the american revolution after a stormy three weeks at sea , the warship arrived off le havre , france , early in october ; and , following some initial trepidation about the government 's attitude toward lafayette 's return to a france now ruled by the ultra-reactionary king charles x , brandywines passenger and her captain disembarked , the former to return home and the latter to tour the country for six months to study shipyards , ship design and other naval matters at the end of a fortnight in port , brandywine sailed for the balearic islands in company with the ship of the line and sloop of war after passing the rest of spring and much of the summer in repairs and outfitting for duty in the pacific ocean , brandywine departed new york city on september 3 , 1826 as the flagship of commodore jacob jones who was sailing around cape horn for the pacific coast of south america to take over command of the american squadron in the region from commodore isaac hull and his flagship , uss united states joyner library , east carolina university , greenville , north carolina , usa spain had abandoned her efforts to re-conquer her empire in the western hemisphere , so brandywines tour of duty in the pacific proved far less troubled than that of her predecessor while napoleon 's brother , joseph bonaparte , sat on the throne there , naples had seized several american merchantmen ; and the most recent successor to the throne , king ferdinand ii , had repudiated the debts not a shot was fired and no explicit reference to the squadron was made during the negotiations ; nevertheless , the unspoken message of power helped the king to see the justice of the american claims and prompted him to sign a treaty promising to pay 2,100,000 ducats to the u.s her remaining months in the mediterranean proved less dramatic ; and brandywine sailed for the united states late in the spring of 1833 , returning to new york on july 9 and going out of commission two days later on november 3 , 1836 , she collided with the peruvian ship limena off callao , peru , while limena was on a voyage from callao to igargue , peru ; limena suffered severe damage and put back into callao for repairs finally , expiring enlistments signaled the time for brandywine to sail for home , and she departed callao in january 1837 , bringing commodore wadsworth back home at the conclusion of his own tour of duty after being laid up for more than two years , the frigate was recommissioned on august 2 , 1839 , william compton bolton in command ; and , once outfitted , sailed for the mediterranean on october 22 in 1837 , when many people in the united states had sympathized with canadian rebels , some canadian loyalists had captured the steamboat caroline from the american side of the niagara river in november 1840 , a canadian had been arrested and charged with murder in lewiston , new york , after drunkenly boasting that he had taken part in the cutting out of caroline and had killed an american feelings on both sides of the atlantic deepened during the spring of 1841 , and the american minister to the court of st after rounding the cape of good hope , she reached bombay , india on october 24 to pick up the special envoy to china , caleb cushing , and took him to macau where he went ashore and began negotiations for a treaty brandywine , on the other hand , remained in the orient until departing macau for honolulu , hawaii on december 2 , carrying word of the chinese privy council 's approval of the treaty at the end of a long and successful cruise , brandywine stood into norfolk , virginia on september 17 , 1845 , and was decommissioned there eight days later brandywine is notable as the final evolution of the 44-gun frigate design that began by and her sisters a quarter-century earlier ; while ships such as were launched in the 1840s and differed in details , their basic design was identical to brandywine brandywine was also the very first warship ever built with an innovative stern which reduced the chronic vulnerability of the traditional square stern ship to enemy fire and allowed her to carry stern-mounted guns
