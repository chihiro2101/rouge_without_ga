in the 1708 commencement speech de nostri temporis studiorum ratione ( on the order of the scholarly disciplines of our times ) , vico said that whoever '' intends a career in public life , whether in the courts , the senate , or the pulpit '' should be taught to '' master the art of topics and to defend both sides of a controversy , be it on nature , man , or politics , in a freer and brighter style of expression , so he can learn to draw on those arguments which are most probable and have the greatest degree of verisimilitude '' ; yet , in scienza nuova , vico denounced defending both sides in controversies as false eloquence his wording was '' verum et factum reciprocantur seu convertuntur '' ( '' the true and the made are convertible into each other '' ) , an idea which can be found also in occasionalism and scotism scholasticism the principle states that truth is verified through creation or invention and not , as per descartes , through observation : '' the criterion and rule of the true is to have made it the new science ( 1725 , scienza nuova ) is his major work and has been highly influential in the philosophy of history , and for historicists such as isaiah berlin and hayden white in the tradition of socrates and cicero , vico 's true orator will be midwife to the birth of '' the true '' ( as an idea ) from '' the certain '' , the ignorance in the mind of the student rediscovery of '' the most ancient wisdom '' of the senses , a wisdom that is humana stultitia ( '' human foolishness '' ) , vico 's emphases on the importance of civic life and of professional obligations are in the humanist tradition vico is best known for his verum factum principle , first formulated in 1710 as part of his de antiquissima italorum sapientia , ex linguae latinae originibus eruenda ( 1710 ) ( '' on the most ancient wisdom of the italians , unearthed from the origins of the latin language '' ) as royal professor of latin eloquence , vico prepared students for higher studies in the fields of law and of jurisprudence ; thus , his lessons were about the formal aspects of the canon of rhetoric , including the arrangement and the delivery of an argument '' as a humanist and early philologist , vico represented '' a different , alternative model that has been extremely important to me in my work '' , which differed from mainstream western prejudice against the orient and the dominating '' standardization '' that came with modernity and culminated in national socialism throughout his academic career , vico would aspire to , but never attain , the more respectable chair of jurisprudence ; however , in 1734 , he was appointed historiographer royal , by charles iii , king of naples , at a salary greater than he had earned as a university professor he would call for a maieutic ( jurisprudential ) oratory art against the grain of the modern privilege of the dogmatic form of reason , in what he called the '' geometrical method '' of rené descartes and the logicians at the port-royal-des-champs abbey one of the clearest and earliest forms of this argument is available in the de italorum sapientia , where vico argues that vico 's position here and in later works is not that the cartesian method is irrelevant , but that its application can not be extended to the civic sphere '' this criterion for truth would later shape the history of civilization in vico 's opus , the scienza nuova ( the new science , 1725 ) , because he would argue that civil life—like mathematics—is wholly constructed ῥητορική , rhētorikē ) is the orderly link between common sense and an end commensurate with oratory ;
