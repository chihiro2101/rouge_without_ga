calibration is like characterization , except that it can include the adjustment of the device , as opposed to just the measurement of the device color management is sometimes sidestepped by calibrating devices to a common standard color space such as srgb ; when such calibration is done well enough , no color translations are needed to get all devices to handle colors consistently image formats themselves ( such as tiff , jpeg , png , eps , pdf , and svg ) may contain embedded icc profile but are not required to do so by the image format color transformation , or color space conversion , is the transformation of the representation of a color from one color space to another it makes it easier to convert colors from one device to a selected standard color space and from that to the colors of another device in this process there are approximations involved which make sure that the image keeps its important color qualities and also gives an opportunity to control on how the colors are being changed in the terminology of the international color consortium , a translation between two color spaces can go through a profile connection space ( pcs ) : color space 1 → pcs ( cielab or ciexyz ) → color space 2 ; conversions into and out of the pcs are each specified by a profile it is a useful tool as it predicts the outcome of the colors and is available as an application in many color management systems : in practice , photographers almost always use relative or perceptual intent , as for natural images , absolute causes color cast , while saturation produces unnatural colors color matching module ( also -method or -system ) is a software algorithm that adjusts the numerical values that get sent to or received from different devices so that the perceived color they produce remains consistent the key issue here is how to deal with a color that can not be reproduced on a certain device in order to show it through a different device as if it were visually the same color , just as when the reproducible color range between color transparencies and printed matters are different macos has added automatic color management ( assuming srgb for most things ) automatically in the os , and applications have to work around this to provide more accurate color management operating systems that use the x window system for graphics can use icc profiles , and support for linux color management , still less mature than on other platforms , is coordinated through openicc at freedesktop.org and makes use of littlecms some image software ( such as photoshop ) perform automatic color separation to maintain color information in cmyk mode using a specified icc profile such as us web coated ( swop ) v2 , notable browser support for color management is : firefox : from version 3.5 enabled by default for icc v2 tagged images , version 8.0 has icc v4 profiles support , but it needs to be activated manually internet explorer : version 9 is the first microsoft browser to partly support icc profiles , but it does not render images correctly according to the windows icc settings ( it only converts non-srgb images to the srgb profile ) and therefore provides no real color management at all google chrome : uses the system provided icc v2 and v4 support on macos , and from version 22 supports icc v2 profiles by default on other platforms
