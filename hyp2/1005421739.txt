the name '' avon '' is a cognate of the welsh word afon '' river '' , both being derived from the common brittonic , '' river '' the avon ( county ) that existed from 1974 to 1996 was named after the river , and covered bristol , bath , and the lower avon valley the avon rises east of the town of chipping sodbury in south gloucestershire , just north of the village of acton turville at malmesbury it joins up with its first major tributary , the tetbury avon , which rises just north of tetbury in gloucestershire upstream of this confluence the river is sometimes referred to as the 'river avon ( sherston branch ) ' to distinguish it from the tetbury branch ordnance survey 1:25,000 scale explorer map series sheet no 168 stroud , tetbury & malmesbury after the two rivers merge , the avon then turns south east away from the cotswolds and then quickly south into the clay dauntsey vale , where it is joined by the river marden , until it reaches the biggest town so far , chippenham the wide vale is now known as the avon vale , and the river flows on via lacock to melksham , then turns north-west through bradford on avon , where the centre of the town grew up around the ford across the river avon , hence the origin of the town 's name ( '' broad-ford '' ) the avon valley between bradford on avon and bath is a classic geographical example of a valley where four forms of ground transport are found : road , rail , river , canal the stretch of river below and above the aqueduct , where it is joined by midford brook , has been used by rowing crews from monkton combe school since at least the beginning of the 1900s named after the 3rd duke of cleveland , it spans the river avon at bathwick , and enabled further development of georgian bath to take place on the south side of the river in the centre of bath it passes under various bridges including the midland bridge which was originally built by the midland railway company to allow the somerset and dorset joint railway access to and from its green park terminus station weston cut is a man made channel , opened in 1727 , for boats to approach and pass through weston lock , which created an island between the cut and the river weir , which became known as dutch island after the owner of the brass mill established on the riverside in the early 18th century in its heyday , between 1709 and 1859 swineford had an active brass and copper industry around the swineford lock which were served by the river which also provided water power for the cloth industry , as did the river boyd , a tributary which flows into the avon near bitton netham lock is the point at netham in bristol at which boats from the river avon , gain access to bristol 's bristol harbour construction started in 1804 to build the tidal new cut , where it is joined by the river malago , and divert the avon along the feeder canal to the harbour ; a system designed and built by william jessop and later improved by isambard kingdom brunel access to the harbour is only possible during the day when the lock keeper will open the gates unless the water level in the river between netham and hanham is above or below the level of the harbour in central bristol , where the river is tide , it is diverted from its original course into the new cut , a channel dug between 1804 and 1809 at a cost of £600,000 this unusual dock has a tentacled plan resulting from its origins as the natural river course of the avon and its tributary , the river frome and siston brook , and is intimately entwined with bristol 's city centre as few docks are as a result of this , the floating harbour is one of the more successful pieces of dockland regeneration , with much of the dockside now occupied by residential , office and cultural premises , and the water area heavily used by leisure craft downstream of central bristol the river passes through the deep avon gorge , spanned by brunel 's clifton suspension bridge , the river is tide and is navigable by seagoing vessels at high tide but drying to a steep sided muddy channel at low tide it was largely the challenge of navigating this section that sealed the fate of the floating harbour as commercial docks and saw them replaced by docks at avonmouth where the avon joins the severn estuary shortly after , it passes the village of pill on the south bank where the pill hobblers were based in order to tow ships up the river to bristol and where yachts and other boats still have moorings in chapel pill and crockerne pill the avonmouth docks are on the north side of the river and are one of the uk 's major ports for chilled foods , especially fruit and vegetables the docks form part of the port of bristol and were operated by the port of bristol authority , part of politics of bristol , until 1991 when the council granted a 150-year lease to the bristol port company currently , pilotage is provided by bristol pilots llp who supply authorised pilots for the river avon and bristol city docks , as well as the severn estuary and the bristol channel ; they are based at avonmouth docks for the purpose of water quality monitoring and improvement the river is divided into several catchment management areas ; south of malmesbury , bristol avon rural and bristol avon urban the kellaways & nbsp ; – west tytherton site of special scientific interest , north east of chippenham , is of geological interest as the river bank exposes callovian highly-fossiliferous sandstone which contains well-preserved bivalvia , gastropoda , brachiopods , belemnites and ammonites the site is of considerable importance for studies relating to the possible glaciation of the area , and of the terrace stratigraphy , particularly as it is one of only two accessible terrace deposits in this part of the avon valley a catchment board for the avon was created by the land drainage act 1930 and became the bristol avon river board under the river boards act 1948 ; the board was in turn replaced by the bristol avon river authority under the water resources act 1963 the distribution of archaeological finds suggests that the western end of the river between bath and avonmouth formed a border between the dobunni and durotriges during the late iron age , prior to the roman conquest of britain further east , between bath and what is now wiltshire , it may also have formed a border of the territory ruled by the belgae the river avon had been navigable from bristol to bath during the early years of the 13th century but construction of mills on the river forced its closure the bristol avon navigation , which runs the from the kennet and avon canal at hanham lock to the bristol channel at avonmouth , was constructed between 1724 and 1727 , following legislation passed by queen anne , by a company of proprietors and the engineer john hore of newbury the bristol channel has a very high tidal range of , second only to bay of fundy in eastern canada ; and the gorge is relatively narrow and meandering , making it notoriously difficult to navigate in 1877 , halfpenny bridge , a pedestrian toll bridge , crossing the river from bath spa railway station to widcombe collapsed with the loss of about 10 lives amongst a large crowd going to the royal bath and west show various points along the river including the valley around freshford are at risk of fluvial flooding , as a result of sediment entering the river and narrowing the channel
