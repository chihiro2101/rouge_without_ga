previously a mediocre student , binford excelled in college and considered pursuing an academic career in biology until he was put off the idea when a professor suggested that there were '' still a few species of blind cave salamanders '' that he could be the first to study at michigan , he saw a sharp contrast between the '' excitement '' of the anthropology department 's cultural anthropology ( which included leslie white ) and the '' people in white coats counting their potsherds '' in the museum of anthropology shortly after his appointment he wrote his first major article , archaeology as anthropology ( 1962 ) , which was stimulated by problems in archaeological methodology that had become apparent with the use of radiocarbon dating to verify the dates and cultural typologies generated with relative dating techniques such as seriation in 1966 they presented a set of papers at a meeting of the society for american archaeology which were later collected in the landmark new perspectives in archaeology ( 1968 ) , edited by binford and his then wife sally , also an archaeologist by the time this volume was published he had left chicago â€“ dismissed , according to binford , because of increasing tension between himself and the senior archaeologists in the faculty , particularly robert braidwood binford withdrew from the theoretical debates that followed the rapid adoption of new archaeology ( by then also called processual archaeology ) in the 1960s and 70s , instead focusing on his work on the mousterian , a middle palaeolithic lithic industry found in europe , north africa and the near east in 1969 he decided to undertake ethnography fieldwork among the nunamiut in alaska , in order to better understand the periglacial environment that mousterian hominins occupied , and to see first hand how hunter-gatherer behavior is reflected in material remains he frequently collaborated with his third wife , sally binford , who was also an archaeologist ; the couple married while they were graduate students at the university of chicago , and co-edited new perspectives in archaeology ( 1968 ) , among other works as a leading advocate of the '' new archaeology '' movement of the 1960s , he proposed a number of ideas that became central to processual archaeology his subsequent inability to explain the mousterian facies using a functional approach led to his ethnoarchaeological work among the nunamiut and the development of his middle-range theory constructing frames of reference : an analytical method for archaeological theory building using hunter-gatherer and environmental data sets berkeley : university of california press , ( 2001 ) debating archaeology san diego : academic press , ( 1989 ) faunal remains from klasies river caves ( 1984 ) working at archaeology ( studies in archaeology ) ( 1983 ) in pursuit of the past : decoding the archaeological record ( 1983 ) bones , ancient men and modern myths ( 1981 ) nunamiut ethnoarchaeology ( 1978 ) an archaeological perspective new york : seminar press , ( 1972 ) new perspectives in archaeology ( 1968 ) archaeology as anthropology ( 1962 )
