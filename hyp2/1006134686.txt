bopet film was developed in the mid-1950s , izard , emmette farr , '' production of polyethylene terephthalate '' , u.s adams , john francis edward ; gerber , kenneth george ; holmes-walker , william anthony , '' process for the production of biaxially oriented polyethylene terephthalate film '' , u.s thumb the manufacturing process begins with a film of molten polyethylene terephthalate ( pet ) being extruded onto a chill roll , which quenches it into the amorphous state the orientation of the polymer chains is responsible for the high strength and stiffness of biaxially oriented pet film , which has a typical young 's modulus of about roasting bags metallised films laminated sheet metal ( aluminium or steel ) used in the manufacture of cans ( bisphenol a-free alternative to lacquers ) a clear overlay on a map , on which notations , additional data , or copied data , can be drawn without damaging the map metallized bopet is used as a mirror-like decorative surface on some book covers , t-shirts , and other flexible cloths protective covering over buttons/pins/badges the glossy top layer of a polaroid sx-70 photographic print as a backing for very fine sandpaper bopet film is used in bagging comic books , in order to best protect them during storage from environmental conditions ( moisture , heat , and cold ) that would otherwise cause paper to slowly deteriorate over time this material is used for archival science storage of documents by the library of congress ( mylar® type d , ici melinex 516 or equivalent ) and several major library comic book research collections , including the comic art collection at michigan state university while bopet is widely ( and effectively ) used in this archival sense , it is not immune to the effects of fire and heat and could potentially melt , depending on the intensity of the heat source , causing further damage to the encased item similarly , trading card decks ( such as pokémon , magic : the gathering , and yu-gi-oh ! ) are packaged in pouches or sleeves made of metallized bopet an electrical insulation material insulation for houses and tents , reflecting thermal radiation five layers of metallized bopet film in nasa 's spacesuits make them radiation resistant and help regulate temperature metallized bopet is intended to be used for solar sails as an alternative means of propulsion for spacecraft such as cosmos 1 translucent mylar film , as wide as 48 '' and in up to 12 ' in length , found widespread use as a non-dimensional engineering drawing media in the aerospace industry due to its dimensional stability ( also see printing media section below ) high performance sails for sailboats , hang gliding , paragliding and kites use bopet films as the back face of the pv modules in solar panels metallized bopet as a reflector material for solar cooking stoves to bridge control surface gaps on sailplanes ( gliders ) , reducing profile drag the descent stage of the apollo 's lunar module is covered in bopet because it 's lightweight and made sure the inside temperature of the inside of the desecent stage ( where a significant amount of apperature was stored ) was normal bopet film has been used in the production of banjo & drumheads since 1958 due to its durability and acoustical properties when stretched over the bearing edge of the drum they are made in single- and double-ply versions , with each ply being in thickness , with a transparent or opaque surface , originally used by the company evans metallized bopet film , along with other plastic films , is used as a dielectric in foil capacitors transparency ( projection ) for photocopiers or laser printers ( bopet film withstands the high heat ) by the american chemistry council ( html format ) or ( pdf format ) - 1.9mb , which includes the '' chasing arrow '' recycling symbols ( pet is 1 ) and a description of plastics
