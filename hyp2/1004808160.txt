entrepreneur.com marginal cost and marginal revenue , depending on whether the calculus approach is taken or not , are defined as either the change in cost or revenue as each additional unit is produced , or the derivative of cost or revenue with respect to the quantity of output then , if marginal revenue is greater than marginal cost at some level of output , marginal profit is positive and thus a greater quantity should be produced , and if marginal revenue is less than marginal cost , marginal profit is negative and a lesser quantity should be produced in calculus terms , the requirement that the optimal output have higher profit than adjacent output levels is that : : \frac , where and refer to the midpoints between the old and new values of price and quantity respectively if , contrary to what is assumed in the graph , the firm is not a perfect competitor in the output market , the price to sell the product at can be read off the demand curve at the firm 's optimal mechanism right an equivalent perspective relies on the relationship that , for each unit sold , marginal profit ( mπ ) equals marginal revenue ( mr ) minus marginal cost ( mc ) since total profit increases when marginal profit is positive and total profit decreases when marginal profit is negative , it must reach a maximum where marginal profit is zero—where marginal cost equals marginal revenue—and where lower or higher output levels give lower profit levels the intuition behind this result is that , if demand is inelastic at some value q 1 then a decrease in q would increase p more than proportionately , thereby increasing revenue pq ; since lower q would also lead to lower total cost , profit would go up due to the combination of increased revenue and decreased cost the profit-maximizing output level is represented as the one at which total revenue is the height of c and total cost is the height of b ; the maximal profit is measured as the length of the segment cb in the accompanying diagram , the linear total revenue curve represents the case in which the firm is a perfect competitor in the goods market , and thus can not set its own selling price moreover , one must consider '' the revenue the firm loses on the units it could have sold at the higher price '' —that is , if the price of all units had not been pulled down by the effort to sell more units at the output level at which marginal revenue equals marginal cost , marginal profit is zero and this quantity is the one that maximizes profit that is , selling the extra unit results in a small drop in price which reduces the revenue for all units sold by the amount q ( ∆p/∆q )
