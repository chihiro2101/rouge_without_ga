… in this approach , the ultimate capability delivered to the user is divided into two or more blocks , with increasing increments of capability.software development shall follow an iterative spiral development process in which continually expanding software versions are based on learning from earlier development many examples of early usage are provided in craig larman and victor basili 's article '' iterative and incremental development : a brief history '' , iterative and incremental development : a brief history , craig larman and victor basili , ieee computer , june 2003 with one of the earliest being nasa 's 1960s project mercury in addition , the united states agency for international development ( usaid ) also employs an iterative and incremental developmental approach to its programming cycle to design , monitor , evaluate , learn and adapt international development projects with a project management approach that focuses on incorporating collaboration , learning , and adaptation strategies to iterate and adapt programming while the term iterative and incremental development got started in the software industry , many hardware and embedded software development efforts are using iterative and incremental techniques '' some organizations , such as the us department of defense , have a preference for iterative methodologies , starting with mil-std-498 '' clearly encouraging evolutionary acquisition and iid '' in a light-weight iterative project the code may represent the major source of documentation of the system ; however , in a critical iterative project a formal software design document may be used the iteration involves the redesign and implementation of iteration is to be simple , straightforward , and modular , supporting redesign at that stage or as a task added to the project control list for example , the large us launch service provider united launch alliance ( ula ) began in 2015 a decade-long project to restructure its launch business—reducing atlas vdelta iv to one—using an iterative and incremental approach to get to a partially-reusable and much lower-cost launch system over the next decade the main cause of the software development projects failure is the choice of the model , so should be made with a great care comparing the two approaches , some patterns begin to emerge : user involvement : in the waterfall model , the user is involved in two stages of the model , i.e variability : the software is delivered to the user only after the build stage of the life cycle is completed , for user acceptance testing business value is delivered all at once , and only at the very end of the project , whereas backtracking is possible in an iterative approach for example , the waterfall development paradigm completes the project-wide work-products of each discipline in one step before moving on to the next discipline in a succeeding step
