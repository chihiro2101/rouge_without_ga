all forms of al ( oh ) 3 crystals are hexagonal : gibbsite is also known as γ-al ( oh ) 3 or α-al ( oh ) 3 bayerite is also known as α-al ( oh ) 3 or β-alumina trihydrate citation needed nordstrandite is also known as al ( oh ) 3 doyleite hydrargillite , once thought to be aluminium hydroxide , is an aluminium phosphate nonetheless , both gibbsite and hydrargillite refer to the same polymorphism of aluminium hydroxide , with gibbsite used most commonly in the united states and hydrargillite used more often in europe it neutralizes the acid , yielding a salt : : 3 hcl + al ( oh ) 3 → alcl 3 + 3 h 2 o in bases , it acts as a lewis acid by binding hydroxide ions : : al ( oh ) 3 + oh − → al ( oh ) 4 − the waste solid , bauxite tailings , is removed and aluminium hydroxide is precipitated from the remaining solution of sodium aluminate it is selected for these applications because it is colorless ( like most polymers ) , inexpensive , and has good fire retardant properties in addition to behaving as a fire retardant , it is very effective as a smoke suppressant in a wide range of polymers , most especially in polyesters , acrylics , ethylene vinyl acetate , epoxies , pvc and rubber aluminium hydroxide is a feedstock for the manufacture of other aluminium compounds : speciality calcined aluminas , aluminium sulfate , polyaluminium chloride , aluminium chloride , zeolites , sodium aluminate , activated alumina , and aluminium nitrate freshly precipitated aluminium hydroxide forms gels , which are the basis for the application of aluminium salts as flocculants in water purification it is preferred over other alternatives such as sodium bicarbonate because al ( oh ) 3 , being insoluble , does not increase the ph of stomach above 7 and hence , does not trigger secretion of excess acid by the stomach it reacts with excess acid in the stomach , reducing the acidity of the stomach content , which may relieve the symptoms of ulcers , heartburn or dyspepsia
