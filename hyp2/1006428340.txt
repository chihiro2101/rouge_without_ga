after a late start to the campaigning season because it was preceded by an unusually-harsh winter , the allied campaign of 1709 began in mid-june unable to bring the french army , under marshal villars , battle because of the strong french defensive lines and his orders from versailles not to risk battle , the duke of marlborough concentrated instead on taking the fortresses of tournai and ypres since it was by now early september , rather than run the risk of disease spreading in his army in the poorly-draining land around ypres , marlborough moved eastwards towards the lesser fortress of mons villars moved after him , under new orders from louis xiv to prevent the fall of mons at all costs , which was effectively an order for the aggressive marshal to give battle the allied army , with mainly dutch and austrian troops but also considerable british and prussian contingents , was led by the duke of marlborough and prince eugene of savoy , on 11 september , the austrians attacked with the support of prussian and danish troops , under the command of count albrecht konrad finck von finckenstein , pushing the french left wing back into the forest behind them the dutch , under the command of john william friso , prince of orange , on the allied left wing , attacked the french right flank half an hour later and succeeded with heavy casualties in distracting boufflers enough that he could not come to villars ' aid the decisive final attack was made on the now-weakened french centre by british infantry , under the command of the earl of orkney , which managed to occupy the french line of redan , boufflers , realising that the battle could not be won , ordered a retreat , which was made in good order by the norms of warfare of the era , the battle was an allied victory since the french withdrew at the end of the day 's fighting and left marlborough 's army in possession of the battlefield unlike in his previous victories , however , the french army was able to withdraw in good order and relatively intact , and remained a potent threat to further allied operations indeed , villars wrote to louis xiv that another such french defeat would destroy the allied armies , in a letter to louis xiv , villars wrote : '' si dieu nous fait la grâce de perdre encore une pareille bataille , votre majesté peut compter que tous ses ennemis seront détruits '' richard blackmore 's instructions to vander beck was virtually alone among english poems in attempting to celebrate the '' victory '' of marlborough at malplaquet , and it moved the english tories to begin agitating for a withdrawal from the alliance once they formed a government the next year
