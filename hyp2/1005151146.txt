pepsin is expressed as a zymogen called pepsinogen , whose primary structure has an additional 44 amino acids compared to the active enzyme this zymogen is activated by hydrochloric acid ( hcl ) , which is released from parietal cells in the stomach lining the hormone gastrin and the vagus nerve trigger the release of both pepsinogen and hcl from the stomach lining when food is ingested hydrochloric acid creates an acidic environment , which allows pepsinogen to unfold and cleave itself in an autocatalytic fashion , thereby generating pepsin ( the active form ) phenylalanine , leucine and methionine at the p1 position , and phenylalanine , tryptophan and tyrosine at the p1 ' position result in the highest cleavage probability exposure of laryngeal mucosa to enzymatically active pepsin , but not irreversibly inactivated pepsin or acid , results in reduced expression of protective proteins and thereby increases laryngeal susceptibility to damage under non-acid conditions ( neutral ph ) , pepsin is internalized by cells of the upper airways such as the larynx and hypopharynx by a process known as receptor-mediated endocytosis such exposure to pepsin at neutral ph and endocyctosis of pepsin causes changes in gene expression associated with inflammation , which underlies signs and symptoms of reflux , and tumor progression the statyl residue of pepstatin is thought to be responsible for pepstatin inhibition of pepsin ; statine is a potential analog of the transition state for catalysis by pepsin and other acid proteases the n-terminus of pi-3 in the pi-3 : pepsin complex is positioned by hydrogen bonds which form an eight-stranded Î²-sheet , where three strands are contributed by pepsin and five by pi-3 pepsin is used for a variety of applications in food manufacturing : to modify and provide whipping qualities to soy protein and gelatin , to modify vegetable proteins for use in nondairy snack items , to make precooked cereals into instant hot cereals , and to prepare animal and vegetable protein hydrolysates for use in flavoring foods and beverages it is used in the leather industry to remove hair and residual tissue from hides and in the recovery of silver from discarded photographic films by digesting the gelatin layer that holds the silver one or more of the disulfide bonds that join the heavy chains in the hinge region are preserved , so the two fab regions of the antibody remain joined together , yielding a divalent molecule ( containing two antibody binding sites ) , hence the designation f ( ab ' ) 2 papain cleaves igg above the hinge region containing the disulfide bonds that join the heavy chains , but below the site of the disulfide bond between the light chain and heavy chain in tissues such as lymph nodes or spleen , or in peripheral blood preparations , cells with fc receptors ( macrophages , monocytes , b lymphocytes , and natural killer cells ) are present which can bind the fc region of intact antibodies , causing background staining in areas that do not contain the target antigen these fragments may also be desirable for staining cell preparations in the presence of plasma , because they are not able to bind complement , which could lyse the cells
