joffre subsequently spent much of his career in the colonies as a military engineer , serving with distinction in the keelung campaign during the sino-french war ( august 1884 – april 1885 ) 136–37 after returning to france in 1903 to command the 19th cavalry brigade , he then moved to the war ministry in paris as director of engineers in 1904 general victor-constant michel , the vice president of the conseil supérieur de la guerre and commander-in-chief designate , was sacked after proposing a defensive strategy in the event of war with germany at the outbreak of war , the french plan clashed with the german schlieffen plan , much to the detriment of the french on 15 august , after german cavalry had been spotted at dinant on the meuse , and after repeated warnings from charles lanrezac of the fifth army , joffre issued his instruction particuliere no 10 , stating that the main german effort would come through belgium 43 although joffre was aware ( 8am on 18 august ) that as many as fifteen german corps were moving through belgium ( in fact it was sixteen , and twenty-eight if the german fourth and fifth armies are also included ) , he believed that only a few of these would come west of the meuse , where he believed they could be held by the british and belgians the french third and fourth armies were preparing to attack into the ardennes , and he wanted lanrezac 's fifth army to attack the bulk of the german right wing on its west flank as – it was assumed – it attacked the left flank of french fourth army 54–55 the french first and second armies battle of lorraine on 19 and 20 august and were beaten back with severe loss by german forces , which were preparing for a counteroffensive the germans entered brussels that day , but joffre was convinced , after the defeat in alsace-lorraine and air and cavalry reports of strong german forces in belgium , that the german centre in the ardennes must be weak 97 on 23 august joffre reported to adolphe messimy , the french war minister , that his fourth army was pressing into the ardennes with ( he believed , wrongly ) local numerical superiority , despite the fact that he had already received reports of french defeats in this sector on previous days in his memoirs joffre later admitted that he had been mistaken ( he was also unaware of the fall of namur and of the extent of the fighting at mons and charleroi on his left ) , but at the time he demanded that the french fourth army resume the offensive and provide lists of unsatisfactory officers for dismissal on 25 august , rejecting the advice of his staff officer general berthelot that lanrezac be ordered to attack westwards against the inside of the german right wing , he instead had major maurice gamelin draw up plans for a french concentration at amiens , with many of the troops drawn from the french right wing in alsace , and with regret also ordered the successful counterattacks of the third army and the army of lorraine be called off 141 concerned at reports ( which later turned out to be exaggerated ) that the british had been defeated at le cateau and would need french protection to recover cohesion , early on 27 august joffre gave lanrezac a direct written order to counterattack as soon as his forces were on open ground , where they could use their artillery , which lanrezac had told him was the key factor 146–49 , 152 fernand de langle de cary 's fourth army , originally intended to be the spearhead of the attack into the ardennes , was a strong force and had made several counterattacks , but joffre now ordered it to cease counterattacking and to send a detachment under ferdinand foch to cover the gap between fourth and fifth armies ; this became the new ninth army on 26 august rené viviani formed a new government ( the union sacrée ) , and on 27 august the new war minister , alexandre millerand , who had replaced messimy largely because of the poor state of the paris defences , visited joffre 166 on 1 september the fifth army retreated across the aisne in some confusion , and joffre issued his instruction generale no 4 , placing maunoury 's sixth army under the command of joseph gallieni as military governor of paris and forming a new cavalry corps under louis conneau to fill the gap between the fifth army and the british expeditionary force ( bef ) 181–83 on the night of 3–4 september joffre sent a handwritten note to gallieni , wanting maunoury to push east along the north bank of the marne , although not specifying a date this was in line with his modification of instruction general no 4 ( 2 september ) , envisaging a giant pocket from paris to verdun , of which he enclosed copies to gallieni 87 at 9.45 & nbsp ; am on 4 september gallieni , who had learned from paris aviators the previous day that kluck 's german first army was marching south-east across paris , had the first of a series of telephone calls , conducted through aides , as joffre would not come to the phone , and gallieni refused to speak to anyone else gallieni proposed , depending on how much further the germans were to be allowed to advance , to attack north of the marne on 6 september or south of the marne on 7 september 227 joffre 's reply saying he preferred the southern option ( which would take a day longer as it forced the sixth army to cross to south of the marne , but would keep the sixth army and bef from being separated by the river ) arrived too late to reach gallieni , who had left for a meeting with the bef chief of staff , archibald murray that same afternoon , henry wilson , the bef sub-chief of staff , was negotiating separate plans with franchet d'espèrey , on the british right , which envisaged the sixth army attacking north of the marne 188 in the absence of news from franchet d'espèrey , joffre ordered gamelin to draft orders for maunoury to attack south of the marne on 7 september while joffre was having dinner with the british liaison officer , sidney clive , and two visiting japanese officers , neither of whom appeared to understand a word of french , a message arrived from franchet d'espèrey saying that he would be ready to attack on 6 september at this point gallieni , who returned to paris to find joffre 's message from earlier in the day and a message from wilson , insisted on speaking to joffre personally on the telephone , informing him that it was too late to cancel the movement of maunoury 's army joffre agreed to bring forward the allied offensive to 6 september and to have the sixth army attack north of the marne instead , later writing that he had done so reluctantly as maunoury would probably make contact with the germans on 5 september , but that an extra day would have left the germans in a more '' disadvantageous '' position 190–91 on 7 september gallieni , who had been going over joffre 's head and speaking to the war minister and president raymond poincaré , was ordered not to communicate directly with the government on 7 january 1915 , over joffre 's opposition , president poincaré came out in favour of the proposal of franchet d'espèrey , gallieni and justice minister aristide briand for an expedition to salonika , which he hoped would detach first turkey then austria-hungary , leaving germany '' doomed with viviani 's government in trouble following the resignation of theophile delcasse as foreign minister , the second battle of champagne and the bulgaria during world war i , viviani asked joffre , who had told him that nine out of ten generals would make poor ministers of war , whether gallieni would be a good replacement for millerand '' in the event , briand formed a new government on 29 october 1915 , with viviani as vice-president of the council of ministers ( deputy prime minister ) and gallieni as war minister 229–31 at the meeting of the superior council of defence ( 24 november 1915 ) joffre had briand address the demarcation of his own and gallieni 's authority , and objected to the council discussing operational matters , threatening to resign if they attempted to interfere with his '' liberty 97–98 in autumn 1915 colonel émile driant , commander of a chasseurs brigade and a member of the army commission of the chamber of deputies , complained to gallieni of how joffre had been removing guns and garrisons from verdun and even preparing some forts for demolition 264 gallieni wrote to joffre ( 16 or 18 december 1915 ) , expressing concern at the state of trenches at verdun and elsewhere on the front ; in fact , matters were already being taken in hand at verdun 55 after months of discussion , haig and joffre agreed on 14 february 1916 to an anglo-french battle of the somme , although the british were not pleased at joffre 's suggestion that the british engage in '' wearing out '' attacks prior to the main offensive 40–42 the french general staff had decided in august 1915 to partially disarm all the verdun forts , under the erroneous assumption that they could not resist the effects of modern heavy artillery , and the germans initially made good progress against fortifications that had had their guns removed joffre 's political position had already weakened after the enormous losses of 1915 , and now rumours circulated in paris that joffre had ordered the abandonment of verdun when the germans first attacked early in 1916 joffre asked the british commander-in-chief , douglas haig , to put in a good word with lord bertie , the british ambassador in paris , so that it would get back to the french government joffre was successfully lobbied by robertson , and at the second chantilly conference ( 15–16 november 1916 ) they agreed to concentrate on the western front in 1917 rather than sending greater resources to salonika one of joffre 's last official duties ( 11 december ) was to order maurice sarrail to cease his offensive and establish a strong defensive position , from which further offensives might be launched in the future to briand 's and joffre 's surprise , roques , the minister of war , returned from a fact-finding mission to salonika recommending that sarrail be reinforced and that he no longer report to joffre coming on the back of the disappointing results of the somme campaign and the fall of romania , roques 's report further discredited briand and joffre and added to the parliamentary deputies ' demands for a closed session on 27 november the council of ministers met to debate rescinding the decree of 2 december 1915 , which had placed sarrail under joffre ; briand proposed that joffre be effectively demoted to commander-in-chief in north-east france , reporting to the war minister along with the commander-in-chief at salonika , although he withdrew this proposal after joffre threatened resignation during the closed session ( 28 november – 7 december ) briand had little choice but to make concessions to preserve his government , and in a speech of 29 november he promised to repeal the decree of 2 december 1915 and in vague terms to appoint a general as technical adviser to the government he met joffre on 3 december 1916—according to joffre , promising to appoint him marshal of france and to give him a staff of his own and '' direction of the war '' joffre was appointed '' general-in-chief of the french armies , technical adviser to the government , consultative member of the war committee '' , with robert nivelle as commander-in-chief of the armies of the north and northeast 320–21 it is unclear exactly what briand had told joffre about his role ; he commented , '' this is not what they promised me , '' when reading the newspaper on the morning of 13 december and was put out to be described as '' general-in-chief '' rather than '' commander-in-chief '' however , he soon found that he had no real power—the acting war minister ( admiral lacaze , as hubert lyautey had not yet returned from north africa to take up the position ) forbade him even to approve units ' being granted the fourragère—and on 26 december , the day he was promoted marshal of france , he asked to be relieved joffre was still popular and was the first man to be promoted marshal under the third republic the french along with the british had been preparing to do so since february after the announcement of the severance of diplomatic relations between the united states and germany , in the expectation that an american declaration of war against germany was imminent louis for a haircut , visited the hometowns of abraham lincoln ( springfield , illinois ) and ulysses grant , laid wreaths at the statues of joan of arc and lafayette , and visited west point desnoël , 2010 ) unlike many french generals , who were catholic ( and of the generation educated in the catholic teaching which had grown up after the loi falloux ) and therefore suspected of hostility to the third republic at the time of the battle of the marne , he was heavily dependent on his deputy chief of staff , general henri mathias berthelot 15 his major positive contributions in 1914 were his sustained calm under pressure and the calculated reasoning of an alumnus from école polytechnique , his ruthless dismissal of unsuccessful generals ( three army commanders , ten corps commanders and thirty-eight divisional commanders , neillands , robin the death of glory : the western front 1915 ( john murray , london , 2006 ) , p while the battle of the marne was going on , he handled the problems faced by foch 's ninth army at the st gond marshes , by de langle 's fourth and sarrail 's third near verdun and by castelnau 's second in the nancy area george 3rd class ( russian empire ) knights grand commander ( first class ) of the order of rama ( senangapati , 22 december 1921 , thailand ) doctor honoris causa ( harvard university ) , and of the university of porto and university of coimbra ( portugal ) order of karađorđe 's star with swords ( kingdom of serbia grand cross of the order of the tower and sword of portugal a french aircraft carrier bearing joffre 's name was under construction at the start of world war ii but was never completed due to france 's rapid fall in 1940 avenue du maréchal joffre located in verdun , france rue du maréchal joffre located in nice , france boulevard maréchal joffre in dijon , france avenue du maréchal joffre in chantilly , france ( b ) canada mount joffre , a mountain located on the continental divide on the border of british columbia and alberta file : guerre 14-18-généraux joffre et de castelnau-1914.jpg générals de castelnau ( left ) and joffre ( centre ) , july–august 1914 file : french heavy cavalry paris august 1914.jpg french heavy cavalry , with armour , parading in paris before heading to the front in august 1914 file : joseph joffre 1915 carnavalet.jpg bouchor 's le général joseph joffre in 1915 ( musée carnavalet ) file : haig joffre and french at the front gws joffrefrhaig 01.png joffre with british generals french and haig on the western front in 1915 file : portrait of joseph joffre.jpg portrait of joseph joffre file : joffre et signature.jpg j.joffre and his signature file : joffre usa.jpg joffre in the united states in 1917 file : marshal joffre and mayor at franklin 's grave , phila pa.jpg joffre at the grave of benjamin franklin in 1917 file : joseph joffre nw joffre 01 nw.png marshal of france , joseph joffre file : joseph joffre in japan.jpg joffre in japan in 1922 file : statue of joseph joffre chantilly fra 001.jpg statue of joffre at chantilly , erected in 1930
