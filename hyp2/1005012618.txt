sutherland points out that in the early chapters trollope describes the proudies as intending to spend as much time as possible in london , leaving the field clear for slope to act on his own in barchester with the action easily contained in a single-volume novel : in chapter iv , slope thinks to himself that in the proudies anticipated absences in london '' he , therefore , he , mr slope , would in effect be bishop of barchester '' but when trollope resumed the composition of barchester towers in may 1856 , planning the eventual three-volume novel as a result of the unexpectedly increasing sales of the warden in late 1855 , he expanded the text by keeping the proudies in barchester and introducing a number of new characters who had not appeared in the earlier chapters - the stanhopes , mr arabin , and the thornes inter alia signora madeline vesey neroni née madeline stanhope is the beautiful younger daughter of dr vesey stanhope , given to inflation of her own status- '' her father had been christened vesey as another man is christened thomas , and she had no more right to assume it than would have the daughter of a mr josiah jones to call herself mrs josiah smith , on marrying a man of the latter name '' ; her card bears '' a bright gilt coronet '' , despite the fact that her husband , paulo neroni , '' had had not the faintest title to call himself a scion of even italian nobility '' and although sutherland notes that trollope was '' often indifferent to minor inconsistencies in his narratives '' , he regards these lapses as showing the point at which trollope conceived the idea of the novel series which would eventually became the hugely successful chronicles of barsetshire during this time he changed his idea of writing a short novel ( similar in length to the warden ) to a longer one , and that from this hiatus there arise a number of inconsistencies in the text her interference to veto the reappointment of the universally popular mr septimus harding ( protagonist of trollope 's earlier novel , the warden ) as warden of hiram 's hospital is not well received , even though she gives the position to a needy clergyman , mr quiverful , with 14 children to support however at the beginning of chapter xii slope is writing a letter dated 20 august , and in chapters xxxiii and xxxv it is made clear that miss thorne 's fête champêtre takes place on the last day of september owing to the passage of the power of patronage to a new prime minister , a newcomer , the far more evangelical bishop proudie , gains the see his wife , mrs proudie , exercises an undue influence over the new bishop , making herself as well as the bishop unpopular with most of the clergy of the diocese in the first chapter trollope says that bishop grantley is dying in '' the latter days of july '' and that proudie became bishop '' just a month after his grantly 's demise '' mr slope proposes to mrs bold and is slapped for his presumption ; bertie goes through the motions of a proposal to eleanor and is refused with good grace and the signora has a chat with mr arabin archdeacon grantly , dr theophilus grantly , is the son of the former bishop of barchester , dr grantly senior , who dies at the start of the novel the old dean of the cathedral having died , mr slope campaigns to become dean but mr harding is offered the preferment , with a beautiful house in the close and fifteen acres of garden the literary scholar john sutherland observes that trollope suspended work on the novel ( having reached the end of chapter viii ) between february 1855 and may 1856 , turning instead to his posthumously published the new zealander
