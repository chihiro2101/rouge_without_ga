botanical artists have traditionally been some of the most exacting and accomplished watercolor painters , and even today , watercolors—with their unique ability to summarize , clarify , and idealize in full color—are used to illustrate scientific and museum publications among the elite and aristocratic classes , watercolor painting was one of the incidental adornments of a good education ; mapmakers , military officers , and engineers used it for its usefulness in depicting properties , terrain , fortifications , field geology , and for illustrating public works or commissioned projects watercolor artists were commonly brought with the geological or archaeological expeditions , funded by the society of dilettanti ( founded in 1733 ) , to document discoveries in the mediterranean , asia , and the new world in the late 18th century , the english cleric william gilpin wrote a series of hugely popular books describing his picturesque journeys throughout rural england , and illustrated them with self-made sentimentalized monochrome watercolors of river valleys , ancient castles , and abandoned churches the three english artists credited with establishing watercolor as an independent , mature painting medium are paul sandby ( 1730–1809 ) , often called the '' father of the english watercolor '' ; thomas girtin ( 1775–1802 ) , who pioneered its use for large format , romantic or picturesque landscape painting ; and joseph mallord william turner ( 1775–1851 ) , who brought watercolor painting to the highest pitch of power and refinement , and created hundreds of superb historical , topographical , architectural , and mythological watercolor paintings his method of developing the watercolor painting in stages , starting with large , vague color areas established on wet paper , then refining the image through a sequence of washes and glazes , permitted him to produce large numbers of paintings with '' workshop efficiency '' and made him a multimillionaire , partly by sales from his personal art gallery , the first of its kind the confluence of amateur activity , publishing markets , middle class art collecting , and 19th-century technique led to the formation of english watercolor painting societies : the society of painters in water colours ( 1804 , now known as the royal watercolour society ) and the new water colour society ( 1832 , now known as the royal institute of painters in water colours ) they also engaged in petty status rivalries and aesthetic debates , particularly between advocates of traditional ( '' transparent '' ) watercolor and the early adopters of the denser color possible with gouache ( '' opaque '' watercolor ) the late georgian and victorian periods produced the zenith of the british watercolor , among the most impressive 19th-century works on paper , due to artists turner , varley , cotman , david cox , peter de wint , william henry hunt , john frederick lewis , myles birket foster , frederick walker , thomas collier , arthur melville and many others in particular , the graceful , lapidary , and atmospheric watercolors ( '' genre paintings '' ) by richard parkes bonington created an international fad for watercolor painting , especially in england and france in the 1820s watercolor tutorials were first published in this period by varley , cox , and others , establishing the step-by-step painting instructions that still characterize the genre today ; the elements of drawing , a watercolor tutorial by english art critic john ruskin , has been out of print only once since it was first published in 1857 commercial brands of watercolor were marketed and paints were packaged in metal tubes or as dry cakes that could be '' rubbed out '' ( dissolved ) in studio porcelain or used in portable metal paint boxes in the field breakthroughs in chemistry made many new pigments available , including synthetic ultramarine blue , cobalt blue , viridian , cobalt violet , cadmium yellow , aureolin ( potassium cobaltinitrite ) , zinc white , and a wide range of carmine and madder lakes in the 19th century , the influence of the english school helped popularize '' transparent '' watercolor in france , and it became an important medium for eugène delacroix , françois marius granet , henri-joseph harpignies , and the satirist honoré daumier unfortunately , the careless and excessive adoption of brightly colored , petroleum-derived aniline dyes ( and pigments compounded from them ) , which all fade rapidly on exposure to light , and the efforts to properly conserve the twenty thousand j in this period , american watercolor painting often imitated european impressionism and post-impressionism , but significant individualism flourished in '' regional '' styles of watercolor painting from the 1920s to 1940s in particular , the '' cleveland school '' or '' ohio school '' of painters centered around the cleveland museum of art , and the california scene painters were often associated with hollywood animation studios or the chouinard art institute ( now california institute of the arts ) watercolor paint consists of four principal ingredients : a pigment ; gum arabic as a binder to hold the pigment in suspension ; additives like glycerin , ox gall , honey , and preservatives to alter the viscosity , hiding , durability or color of the pigment and vehicle mixture ; and evaporating water , as a solvent used to thin or dilute the paint for application the more general term watermedia refers to any painting medium that uses water as a solvent and that can be applied with a brush , pen , or sprayer originally ( in the 16th to 18th centuries ) , watercolor binders were sugars and/or hide glues , but since the 19th century , the preferred binder is natural gum arabic , with glycerin and/or honey as additives to improve plasticity and solubility of the binder , and with other chemicals added to improve product shelf life watercolor painters before the turn of the 18th century had to make paints themselves using pigments purchased from an apothecary or specialized '' colorman '' , and mixing them with gum arabic or some other binder in 1781 , he and his brother , thomas reeves , were awarded the silver palette of the society of arts , for the invention of the moist watercolor paint-cake , a time-saving convenience , introduced in the '' golden age '' of english watercolor painting in the partisan debates of the 19th-century english art world , gouache was emphatically contrasted to traditional watercolors and denigrated for its high hiding power or lack of '' transparency '' ; '' transparent '' watercolors were exalted 187 the traditional claim that '' transparent '' watercolors gain '' luminosity '' because they function like a pane of stained glass laid on paper—the color intensified because the light passes through the pigment , reflects from the paper , and passes a second time through the pigment on its way to the viewer—is false watercolor paints typically do not form a cohesive paint layer , as do acrylic or oil paints , but simply scatter pigment particles randomly across the paper surface ; the transparency is caused by the paper being visible between the particles 183 watercolors may appear more vivid than acrylics or oils because the pigments are laid down in a purer form , with few or no fillers ( such as kaolin ) obscuring the pigment colors in fact , an important function of the gum is to facilitate the '' lifting '' ( removal ) of color , should the artist want to create a lighter spot in a painted area
