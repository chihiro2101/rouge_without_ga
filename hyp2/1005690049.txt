rebellion of 1857 until the start of world war i , the gurkha regiments saw active service in burma , afghanistan , northeast india and the north-west frontier of india , malta ( the russo-turkish war , 1877–78 ) , cyprus , malaya , china ( the boxer rebellion of 1900 ) and tibet ( younghusband 's expedition of 1905 ) after 1948 , the brigade of gurkhas ( part of the british army ) was formed and adopted standard british army rank structure and nomenclature , except for the three viceroy commission ranks between warrant officer 1 and second lieutenant ( jemadar , subedar and subedar major ) which remained , albeit with different rank titles lieutenant ( queens gurkha officer ) , captain ( qgo ) and major ( qgo ) after indian independence , and the partition of india , in 1947 and under the tripartite agreement , the original ten gurkha regiments consisting of the 20 pre-war battalions were split between the british army and the newly independent indian army following the end of the war , the gurkhas were returned to india , and during the inter-war years were largely kept away from the internal strife and urban conflicts of the sub-continent , instead being employed largely on the frontiers and in the hills where fiercely independent tribesmen were a constant source of trouble in addition , gurkhas would , for the first time , be able to transfer to another army unit after five years ' service and women would also be allowed to join , although not in first-line units , conforming to the british army 's policy during the anglo-nepalese war ( 1814–1816 ) between the gorkha kingdom ( present-day federal democratic republic of nepal ) and the east india company , the gorkhali soldiers impressed the british , who called them gurkhas during the battle of loos ( june–december 1915 ) a battalion of the 8th gurkhas fought to the last man , hurling themselves time after time against the weight of the german defences , and in the words of the indian corps commander , lt although their deployment is still governed by the 1947 tripartite agreement , in the post-1947 conflicts india has fought in , gorkhas have served in almost all of them , including the wars with pakistan in 1947 , 1965 , 1971 and 1999 and also against china in 1962 a spokesperson for the communist party of nepal ( maoist ) , which was expected to play a major role in the new secular republic , stated that recruitment as mercenaries was degrading to the nepalese people and would be banned twelve regiments from the nepalese army also took part in the relief of lucknow under the command of shri teen ( 3 ) maharaja jung bahadur rana of nepal and his older brother c-in-c ranodip singh kunwar ( ranaudip singh bahadur rana ) ( later to succeed jung bahadur and become sri teen maharaja ranodip singh of nepal ) after indian independence in 1947 , gurkha officers in regiments which became part of the british army received the king 's ( later queen 's ) gurkha commission , and were known as king's/queen 's gurkha officers ( kgo/qgo ) in a landmark ruling on 30 september 2008 the high court in london decided that the home secretary 's policy allowing gurkhas who left the army before 1997 to apply for settlement in the united kingdom was irrationally restrictive in its criteria , and overturned it gurkhas served as troops under contract to the british east india company in the pindaree war of 1817 , in bharatpur in 1826 , and the first and second anglo-sikh wars in 1846 and 1848 the reason appears to have been the pragmatic one that the gurkha regiments of the indian army would continue to serve in their existing roles in familiar territory and under terms and conditions that were well established a total of 250,280 gurkhas served in 40 battalions , plus eight nepalese army battalions , parachute , training , garrison and porter units during the war , osprey military elite series 49 the gurkhas by mike chappell 1993 in almost all theatres four gurkha regiments were transferred to the british army on 1 january 1948 : 2nd king edward vii 's own gurkha rifles ( the sirmoor rifles ) 6th queen elizabeth 's own gurkha rifles 7th duke of edinburgh 's own gurkha rifles 10th princess mary 's own gurkha rifles they formed the brigade of gurkhas and were initially stationed in malaya in addition , five training battalions ( 14 gr , 29 gr , 38 gr , 56 gr and 710 gr ) were raised , while other units ( 25 gr and 26 gr ) were raised as garrison battalions for keeping the peace in india and defending rear areas they served on the battlefields of france in the battles of loos , givenchy , and neuve chapelle ; in belgium at the battle of ypres ; in mesopotamia , iran , suez canal and palestine against turkish advance , gallipoli and salonika on 9 june 2015 , a celebration called the gurkha 200 , held at the royal hospital chelsea and attended by members of the royal family , commemorated the bicentennial of the gurkha welfare trust by paying tribute to gurkha culture and military service following the dunkirk evacuation of the british expeditionary force ( bef ) in 1940 , the nepalese government offered to increase recruitment to enlarge the number of gurkha battalions in british service to 35 despite the changes , many gurkhas who had not served long enough to entitle them to a pension faced hardship on their return to nepal , and some critics derided the government 's decision to only award the new pension and citizenship entitlement to those joining after 1 july 1997 , claiming that this left many ex-gurkha servicemen still facing a financially uncertain retirement since partition , the gurkha regiments that were transferred to the indian army have established themselves as a permanent and vital part of the newly independent indian army the number of gurkha battalions was increased to 33 , and gurkha units were placed at the disposal of the british high command by the gurkha government for service on all fronts in addition to keeping peace in india , gurkhas fought in syria , north africa , italy , greece and against the japanese in the jungles of burma , northeast india and also singapore since then , british gurkhas have served in borneo during the confrontation with indonesia , in the falklands war and on various peacekeeping missions in sierra leone , east timor , bosnia and kosovo the four regiments ( or eight battalions ) in british service have since been reduced to a single ( two-battalion ) regiment , while the indian units have been expanded beyond their pre-independence establishment of 12 battalions the 1st/6th gurkhas , having landed at cape helles , led the assault during the first major operation to take a turkish high point , and in doing so captured a feature that later became known as '' gurkha bluff '' the anglo-nepalese war was fought between the gurkha kingdom of nepal and the british east india company as a result of border disputes and ambitious expansionism of both belligerents as a result , they discouraged the inclusion of thakuri and khas groups in the gorkha units and refused to recruit tribes other than gurungs and magars for gorkha units indeed , while britain has reduced its gurkha contingent , india has continued to recruit gorkhas of nepal into gorkha regiments in large numbers , as well as indian gorkhas ( on the application of limbu ) v secretary of state for the home department 2008 ewhc 2261 ( admin ) , acknowledged the '' debt of honour '' to gurkhas discharged before 1997 while the difference is made up through cost of living and location allowances during a gurkha 's actual period of service , the pension payable on his return to nepal is much lower than would be the case for his british counterparts
