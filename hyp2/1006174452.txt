the book is divided into six parts , described in the author 's preface as : various considerations touching the sciences the principal rules of the method which the author has discovered certain of the rules of morals which he has deduced from this method the reasonings by which he establishes the existence of god and of the human soul the order of the physical questions which he has investigated , and , in particular , the explication of the motion of the heart and of some other difficulties pertaining to medicine , as also the difference between the soul of man and that of the brutes what the author believes to be required in order to greater advancement in the investigation of nature than has yet been made , with the reasons that have induced him to write for there is not ordinarily a greater sign of the equal distribution of anything than that every man is contented with his share , '' but also in montaigne , whose formulation indicates that it was a commonplace at the time : '' tis commonly said that the justest portion nature has given us of her favors is that of sense ; for there is no one who is not contented with his share '' descartes continues with a warning : descartes describes his disappointment with his education : '' as soon as i had finished the entire course of study…i found myself involved in so many doubts and errors , that i was convinced i had advanced no farther…than the discovery at every turn of my own ignorance here he describes how in other writings he discusses the idea of laws of nature , of the sun and stars , the idea of the moon being the cause of ebb and flow , on gravitation , and going on to discuss light and fire he goes on to say that he '' was not , however , disposed , from these circumstances , to conclude that this world had been created in the manner i described ; for it is much more likely that god made it at the first such as it was to be '' despite this admission , it seems that descartes ' project for understanding the world was that of re-creating creation—a cosmological project which aimed , through descartes ' particular brand of experimental method , to show not merely the possibility of such a system , but to suggest that this way of looking at the world—one with ( as descartes saw it ) no assumptions about god or nature—provided the only basis upon which he could see knowledge progressing ( as he states in book ii ) thus , in descartes ' work , we can see some of the fundamental assumptions of modern cosmology in evidence—the project of examining the historical construction of the universe through a set of quantitative laws describing interactions which would allow the ordered present to be constructed from a chaotic past he goes on to the motion of the blood in the heart and arteries , endorsing the findings of '' a physician of england '' about the circulation of blood , referring to william harvey and his work de motu cordis in a marginal note '' three years have now elapsed since i finished the treatise containing all these matters ; and i was beginning to revise it , with the view to put it into the hands of a printer , when i learned that persons to whom i greatly defer , and whose authority over my actions is hardly less influential than is my own reason over my thoughts , had condemned a certain doctrine in physics , published a short time previously by another individual to which i will not say that i adhered , but only that , previously to their censure i had observed in it nothing which i could imagine to be prejudicial either to religion or to the state , and nothing therefore which would have prevented me from giving expression to it in writing , if reason had persuaded me of its truth ; and this led me to fear lest among my own doctrines likewise some one might be found in which i had departed from the truth , notwithstanding the great care i have always taken not to accord belief to new opinions of which i had not the most certain demonstrations , and not to give expression to aught that might tend to the hurt of any one descartes started his line of reasoning by doubting everything , so as to assess the world from a fresh perspective , clear of any preconceived notions or influences '' the most widely shared thing in the world is good sense , for everyone thinks he is so well provided with it that even those who are the most difficult to satisfy in everything else do not usually desire to have more good sense than they have.… '' ( part i , at p & nbsp ; 6 ) '' of philosophy i will say nothing , except that when i saw that it had been cultivated for so many ages by the most distinguished men ; and that yet there is not a single matter within its sphere which is still not in dispute and nothing , therefore , which is above doubt , i did not presume to anticipate that my success would be greater in it than that of others & nbsp ;
