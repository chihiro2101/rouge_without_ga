a statutory instrument is used when an act of parliament passed after 1947 confers a power to make , confirm or approve delegated legislation on : the queen and states that it is to be exercisable by order in council ; or a minister of the crown and states that it is to be exercisable by statutory instrument minister of the crown includes the welsh ministers statutory instruments act 1946 , section 1a , substituted by section 160 ( 1 ) and schedule 10 , paragraph 1 of the government of wales act 2006 and various acts provide that delegated legislation , although made by another person ( for example , the general dental council dentists act 1984 , section 45 ) , is also to be made by statutory instrument so , for example , an order providing for the transfer of contracts from one national health service body to another may only be notified to the affected bodies , power to make an order under section 95 ( 1 ) of the national health service act 2006 excluded from the requirement to use a statutory instrument by section 272 ( 3 ) ( b ) of that act and by-laws made by a local council may be publicised through an announcement in local newspapers the main effect of delegated legislation being made by statutory instrument is that it is effective as soon as it is made , numbered , catalogued , printed , made available for sale statutory instruments act 1946 , section 2 and published on the internet in addition to the main numbering system , there are a number of subsidiary numbering systems which may indicate an instrument 's position within a particular series of instruments ( in the following list n indicates the number ) : ( c n ) : commencement and/or appointed day orders which bring into force an act or part of an act ( s n ) : scottish series : instruments made by the united kingdom government which apply to scotland only ( these are different from scottish statutory instruments made by the scottish government under its devolved powers ) ( ni n ) : northern ireland series : orders in council made by the united kingdom government under its '' direct rule '' powers ( delegated legislation made by northern ireland departments is made by statutory rules ) statutory instrument practice , table b a motion to annul a statutory instrument is known as a '' prayer '' and uses the following wording : any member of either house can put down a motion that an instrument should be annulled , although in the commons , unless the motion is signed by a large number of members , or is moved by the official opposition , it is unlikely to be debated , and in the lords such a motion is seldom actually voted upon statutory instruments act 1946 , section 5 ( 1 ) the last occasion on which a statutory instrument was annulled was on 22 february 2000 , when the house of lords passed a motion to annul the greater london authority elections rules the parent act may require that the proposed statutory instrument be approved by both houses of parliament ( or , in the case of an instrument which relates to financial matters , by the house of commons only ) either : before it is made ( i.e examples of the use of regulatory reform orders have included the regulatory reform ( sunday trading ) order 2004 ( si 2004/470 ) which repealed section 26 of the revenue act 1889 ( and so re-legalised the selling of methylated spirits on a saturday night or a sunday ) , and the regulatory reform ( trading stamps ) order 2005 ( si 2005/871 ) which repealed the entirety of the trading stamps act 1964 the human rights act 1998 created a procedure under which , if the courts find that an act of parliament contravenes the european convention on human rights , the government can make a remedial order to correct the act in question henry viii clauses after the enactment of the nationality , immigration and asylum act 2002 ( which permitted the secretary of state to make changes using henry viii powers ) , the delegated powers and regulatory reform select committee of the house of lords issued a report concerning the use and drafting of such clauses , which its chairman remarked go '' right to the heart of the key constitutional question of the limits of executive power '' the joint committee may draw the attention of both houses to an instrument if it : imposes a cost on the public finances , requires payments of fees to a public authority , is made under powers which prevent it from being challenged in the courts , attempts to have retrospective effect ( i.e to change the law from a date before the date on which it is made ) when the parent act does not explicitly empower it to do so , makes an unexpected or unusual use of the powers conferred by the parent act , or it may be ultra vires ( outside the powers granted by the parent act , and so unlawful ) , requires further explanation , has been published or laid before parliament late , or appears to contain mistakes the house of lords merits of statutory instruments select committee considers the policy of statutory instruments and would draw the attention of the house of lords to a statutory instrument if it : is politically or legally important , is no longer appropriate due to changes in circumstances since the parent act was passed , implements european law inappropriately , or fails to achieve its intended purpose in addition , the house of commons may refer a statutory instrument to a standing committee for detailed debate on the merits of the legislation if a motion to annul ( in the case of an instrument subject to negative resolution ) or approve ( in the case of an instrument subject to affirmative resolution ) is made as with all delegated legislation , because statutory instruments are made by a person exercising a power conferred by an act of parliament for a specified purpose , rather than by parliament exercising its sovereign law-making powers , they can be struck down by the courts if it is concluded that they are ultra vires ( literally , '' beyond the powers '' conferred by the parent act ) this would be the case if the government attempts to use delegated legislation for a purpose not envisioned by the parent act , or if the legislation is an unreasonable use of the power conferred by the act , or if pre-conditions imposed by the act ( for example , consultation with certain organisations ) have not been satisfied
