for the long term , canada plans to replace the borrowed leopard 2 tanks with a purchase of 100 surplus vehicles from the netherlands , including 20 leopard 2a6ms for combat service , 40 leopard 2a4s for training , and 20 support vehicles , such as armoured recovery vehicles , bridge-layers and armoured engineer vehicles on 2 december 2006 , the leopards stationed in kandahar entered the field , marking the first time since the korean war that a canadian armoured squadron had sent tanks into an active war zone , and fired their guns in combat for the first time in as many years on the following day in response to a taliban rocket attack the porsche prototype ii was eventually selected as the winner of the contest in 1963 ; this did not come as a surprise : it had already been decided in 1961 to build a pre-series of 50 vehicles based on this design ; production of these was started that very year the leopard was soon being purchased from germany by a number of nato members and other allies , including ( in chronological order ) belgium ( 1968 ) , the netherlands ( 1969 ) , norway ( 1970 ) , italy ( 1971 ) , denmark ( 1976 ) , australia ( 1976 ) , canada ( 1978 ) , turkey ( 1980 ) and greece ( 1981 ) simultaneous to the production of the battle tanks , a number of engineering , bridging and recovery vehicles were developed , as well as a number of versions used in the anti-aircraft role the next 110 vehicles in the fifth batch were fitted with a new welded turret , which was equipped with a new armour consisting of two spaced steel plates with a plastic filling between them ( high-hardness armour , and a wedge-shaped gun mantlet , creating the leopard 1a3 2.25-inch + cast frame steel 0.75-inch steel , skirt covering treads ( tracks ) was 1-inch rubber – not steel , but additional armour was applied on the forward half of the skirt during the refit as well as increased 0.6-inch steel on the upper hull sides and 1.1-inch steel on the upper glacis – although only a small handful of c1s received a complete refit the decision was made to allow the tank to increase its weight to the next classification , military loading class 60 ( tonnes ) , and a new design effort was started , with the spaced armour replaced with a much denser perforated armour assemblage its army , not entirely satisfied by the m60 patton ( 300 delivered , of those 200 were produced by oto-melara ) , placed its first order for the leopard 1 in 1970 , with 200 leopard 1a1 and 69 bergepanzer 2 delivered between 1971 and 1972 of the obsolescent tanks , 23 were sold to companies in north america , four put in museums or used as monuments ( including two at the bovington tank museum ) , a brace of leopards , bovington tank museum and 21 used as hard targets on ranges the turrets were again modified for the 1a5 , both in order to store all of the new equipment , as well as to move more of the ammunition into the rear of the turret , as opposed to the left side of the driver where it had previously been stored – 60 leopard , 30 1a5 and 30 1v , all acquired from chile – 501 leopard 1a5gr and 19 leopard 1a4gr in service , some of the remaining 85 leopard 1a4gr and 170 leopard 1v/inl have been converted to support vehicles or have been used for parts , the rest will be scrapped a number of the canadian leopard tanks were pulled out of service during the mid-2000s in anticipation of replacing them with the eight-wheeled mobile gun system , but these plans were put on hold after us experience revealed serious shortcomings related to stability and weight almost as soon as the leopard was introduced into service in 1965 , porsche was awarded a contract to study further improvements to the existing design , while waiting deliveries of the mbt-70 in the mid-1970s in 1971 , the minister of defence , helmut schmidt , decided to abandon the eber-project and build 17 prototypes of a leopard 2 , based on the keiler design , which had a turret with spaced sloped armour the agreement between the us and the federal republic of germany forbade any national development of an mbt apart from technological experimentation , so a new tank project was begun under the designation of experimentalentwicklung or '' experimental development '' , two prototypes of which were built in the netherlands , an improved version equivalent to the a5 called '' leopard 1 verbeterd '' ( improved ) was developed , the same version is used by the chilean army in 2014 , following the government 's decision to replace all land component tracked vehicles ( leopards , aifv , and m113 ) with piranha df90s , belgian leopards were retired from service with most tanks being sold , put on display , or used for target practice when the mbt-70 program was ended , a further contract was offered under the name boar ( eber ) , with an emphasis on using as many technologies from the mbt-70 as possible , but without the problematic xm150 152 & nbsp ; mm ( 6.0 & nbsp ; in ) combined gun/mgm-51 shillelagh missile launcher dossier mbt , ed ai editions , florence , 1990 p.22 at the end of the cold war , the italian army began an upgrade and a downsizing of its armoured units ; a number of leopards were retired in 1991 , along with its fleet of m60 tanks at the end , italy was the biggest customer of the leopard outside germany ( 920 plus 250 special versions ) ; the only one with a licence production ; the only country that produced both m60 and leopard 1 lastly , the leopard was the basis for italian mbts and heavy artillery systems , starting with leone/lion and the following of-40 , leading to other developments like the palmaria and otomatic artillery systems ( both on of-40 hull ) canada sent a squadron of lord strathcona 's horse ( royal canadians ) to afghanistan in the fall of 2006 , equipped with 15 leopard c2 tanks with add-on armour , as well as four recovery vehicles and four engineering vehicles before mass production of the standard version started , it was also decided to add an optical range-finding system for better long-range gunnery , which required the turret to be somewhat taller , and added '' bumps '' on either side of the turret to mount the optics for triangulation in 1974 , the australian government confirmed the purchase of the leopard , with a total of 101 vehicles being acquired ( consisting of 90 mbts , five bridgelayers and six armoured recovery vehicles ) – 71 ; 90 leopard 1a3s were originally delivered as leopard as1 , later upgraded , and since replaced by 59 m1a1 abrams from the us – 132 leopard 1a5s ( be ) ; 334 originally ; all are going to be replaced by 40 mowag piranha iii with a 90 & nbsp ; mm cannon the 1st/3rd lancers is no longer a tank regiment , but a medium infantry battalion , identical to the rest of the medium infantry battalions of the belgian army except for having a single squadron of leopard 1a5 ( be ) canada also operates the leopard 1-based beaver armoured bridgelayer vehicle and taurus armoured recovery vehicle , bought with the original leopard c1 , and the badger armoured engineer vehicle with a dozer blade and excavator bucket , which entered service in 1990 in 2011 , greece is the largest user of leopard 1 tanks , having over 500 leopard 1a5 gr mbts as well as many st , biber and leguan versions the project was ended in 1987 , as the leopard 2 was in widespread service at this point and the 1a5 offered a more reasonable upgrade path for a fraction of the cost since then , almost all users of the leopard 1 have also applied similar changes to their own vehicles , and in most ways the 1a5 be considered the '' standard '' leopard 1 today a further 600 leopard 1a2 and 67 bergepanzer 2 were built in italy by oto melara with deliveries starting in 1975 , with a second batch of 120 build by oto melara between 1980 and 1983 two prototype vehicles were constructed using a new chassis from porsche with the road wheels from the mbt-70 and the original leopard engine , combined with a new wegmann turret mounting the mbt-70 's rheinmetall 120 & nbsp ; mm gun ( although some also mounted the original 105 & nbsp ; mm l7 ) after the first batch was delivered , the next three batches were the leopard 1a1 model , which included a new gun stabilization system from cadillac gage that allowed the tank to fire effectively on the move in july , it was announced that the plan to sell the older leopard tanks to jordan fell through and the canadian department of national defence has yet to decide what to do with the surplus vehicles ) these tanks were upgraded to leopard 1a5-dk along with the first 120 leopards , which were not identical to the german 1a5 with welded turrets between 1974 and 1977 , all of the machines in the first four batches were brought to the same leopard 1a1a1 standard , and given additional turret armour developed by blohm & voss the c-2 mexas with the mine ploughs , mine rollers and the dozers were used alongside the leopard 2 's , until a bracket was installed for the leopard 2a6m to mount them even before these first prototypes were finished , it had ( in 1959 ) been decided that a second phase with improved designs would be started : team a had to build 26 phase ii prototypes for testing , team b six in 1976 , prior to delivery of these new leopards , the canadian government leased 35 leopard 1a2 tanks from the contractor in order to begin training crews from the 4 canadian mechanized brigade group ( 4cmbg ) based in west germany the turrets of 123 surplus leopard 1a5 tanks purchased from the german defence ministry were fitted into the existing hulls ( nine turrets were reserved for spare parts and training ) , and the german tank hulls sold back to the upgrade contractor upgrades were identical to the 1a2 models , the leopard 1a3a1 with the night sights , leopard 1a3a2 with the new radios , and the leopard 1a3a3 with both to meet immediate needs in afghanistan , 20 of the bundeswehr 's stock of leopard 2a6s were upgraded to 2a6m standard and loaned to canada at no cost by the german government – 920 ( +250 special versions ) , retired by the end of 2008 ( replaced by ariete main battle tank ) , the aevs , arvs and ablvs remain in service
