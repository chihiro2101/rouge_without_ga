in late august 1777 , after a distressing 34-day journey from sandy hook on the coast of new jersey , a royal navy fleet of more than 260 & nbsp ; ships carrying some 17,000 british troops under the command of british general sir william howe landed at the head of the elk river , on the northern end of the chesapeake bay near present-day elkton , maryland ( then known as head of elk ) , approximately 40–50 & nbsp ; miles ( 60–80 & nbsp ; km ) southwest of philadelphia his forces were able to reconnoiter the british landing from iron hill near newark , delaware , about 9 miles ( 14 & nbsp ; km ) to the northeast after a skirmish at cooch 's bridge south of newark , the british troops moved north and washington abandoned a defensive encampment along the red clay creek near newport , delaware , to deploy against the british at chadds ford washington employed general john armstrong , commanding about 1,000 pennsylvania militia , to cover pyle 's ford , 5.8 miles south of chadds ford , which was covered by major generals anthony wayne 's and nathanael greene 's divisions major general john sullivan 's division extended northward along the brandywine 's east banks , covering the high ground north of chadds ford along with major general adam stephen 's division and major general lord stirling 's divisions the remainder of howe 's troops , about 9,000 men , under the command of charles , lord cornwallis , marched north to trimble 's ford across the west branch of the brandywine creek , then east to jefferies ford across the east branch ( two fords that washington had overlooked ) , and then south to flank the american forces the british and hessian troops began marching east along the '' great road '' ( now route 1 ) from kennett square , advancing on the american troops positioned where the road crossed brandywine creek '' from the meetinghouse grounds , the battle continued for three miles to the brandywine creek , at chadds ford cornwallis 's column the main british column under general cornwallis ( and accompanied by general howe ) set out from kennett square at 5:00 & nbsp ; a.m having received intelligence from colonel bland 's scouts , washington ordered sullivan to take overall command of stirling and stephen 's divisions ( in addition to his own ) and quickly march north to meet the british flank attack his own division he left under the command of preudhomme de borre , with orders to shift to the right in order to link up with stirling and stephen 's divisions ( from left to right the divisions were arranged as sullivan , stirling , stephen ) howe was slow to attack , which bought time for the americans to position some of their men on high ground near birmingham meetinghouse , about a mile ( 1.6 & nbsp ; km ) north of chadds ford the british brigade of guards caught de borre by surprise on the american left , before de borre had time to fully form , and immediately sent them in to disarray , causing the entire division to rout greene 's reinforcements , combined with the remnants of sullivan 's , stephen 's , and stirling 's divisions , formed south of dilworth and stopped the pursuing british for nearly an hour , letting the rest of the army retreat upon hearing the attack of cornwallis 's column , knyphausen launched an attack against the weakened american center across chadds ford , breaking through the divisions commanded by wayne and william maxwell and forcing them to retreat and leave behind most of their cannons further north , greene sent brigadier general george weedon 's troops to cover the road just outside the town of dilworth to hold off the british long enough for the rest of the continental army to retreat the american retreat was well organized , largely because of the efforts of lafayette , who , although wounded , created a rally point that allowed for a more orderly retreat before being treated for his wound the official british casualty list detailed 587 casualties : 93 killed ( eight officers , seven sergeants and 78 & nbsp ; rank and file ) ; 488 & nbsp ; wounded ( 49 & nbsp ; officers , 40 & nbsp ; sergeants , four drummers and 395 & nbsp ; rank and file ) ; and six rank and file missing unaccounted for one initial report by a british officer recorded american casualties at over 200 & nbsp ; killed , around 750 & nbsp ; wounded , and 400 & nbsp ; prisoners were taken , many of them wounded general howe 's report to the british colonial secretary , lord george germain , said that the americans , '' had about 300 & nbsp ; men killed , 600 & nbsp ; wounded , and near 400 made prisoners '' the nearest thing to a hard figure from the american side was by major general nathanael greene , who estimated that washington 's army had lost between 1,200 and 1,300 & nbsp ; men washington had committed a serious error in leaving his right flank wide open and could have brought about his army 's annihilation had it not been for sullivan , stirling and stephen 's divisions , which bought them time in his report to the continental congress detailing the battle , washington stated : '' despite the day 's misfortune , i am pleased to announce that most of my men are in good spirits and still have the courage to fight the enemy another day '' british and american forces maneuvered around each other for the next several days with only a few encounters such as the battle of paoli on the night of september 20–21 the historic park is owned and operated by the pennsylvania historical and museum commission , on 52 acres ( 210,000 m 2 ) , near chadds ford , delaware county , part of the site of the battle of brandywine file : birmingham friends meetinghouse , pa - front view.jpg birmingham friends meetinghouse in 2017 file : brandywinefieldtoday.jpg the battlefield today , south of meeting house hill file : brandywine osborne 's hill view.jpg view from the top of osborne 's hill looking southeast toward the american positions file : brandywine battlefield washington headquarters.jpg george washington 's headquarters file : monument to lafayette and pulaski.jpg monument to lafayette and pulaski at birmingham cemetery file : birmingham friends burial grounds - battlefield marker.jpg stone wall at birmingham friends meetinghouse the jagers attacked from the right side of the photograph , while the light infantry attacked from the current-day tree line , at the left and center 1777 chester county property atlas explorepahistory brandywine battlefield main site brandywine battlefield park the philadelphia campaign battle of brandywine battle of brandywine at britishbattles.com animated history of the battle of brandywine the battle of the brandywine in pennsbury township animated map of battle of brandywine
