boilers generally have 2 or 3 pressuretrols : a manual-reset pressuretrol , which functions as a safety by setting the upper limit of steam pressure , the operating pressuretrol , which controls when the boiler fires to maintain pressure , and for boilers equipped with a modulating burner , a modulating pressuretrol which controls the amount of fire saturated steam is useful for many purposes , such as cooking , heating and sanitation , but is not desirable when steam is expected to convey energy to machinery , such as a ship 's propulsion system or the '' motion '' of a steam locomotive the furnace can be situated at one end of a fire-tube which lengthens the path of the hot gases , thus augmenting the heating surface which can be further increased by making the gases reverse direction through a second parallel tube or a bundle of multiple tubes ( two-pass or return flue boiler ) ; alternatively the gases may be taken along the sides and then beneath the boiler through flues ( 3-pass boiler ) where a large volume of hot gas is available from some process , a heat recovery steam generator or recovery boiler can use the heat to produce steam , with little or no extra fuel consumed ; such a configuration is common in a combined cycle power plant where a gas turbine and a steam boiler are used low-water cutoff : it is a mechanical means ( usually a float switch ) or an electrode with a safety switch that is used to turn off the burner or shut off fuel to the boiler to prevent it from running once the water goes below a certain point often the water tubes connect large drums , the lower ones containing water and the upper ones steam and water ; in other cases , such as a mono-tube boiler , water is circulated by a pump through a succession of coils water level indicators : they show the operator the level of fluid in the boiler , also known as a sight glass , water gauge or water column babcock & wilcox , boiler manufacturer combustion engineering , boiler manufacturer deaerator dealkalization of water electric water boiler ( for drinking water ) heat-only boiler station hot water reset internally rifled boiler tubes ( also known as serve tubes ) lancashire boiler list of boiler types natural circulation boiler outdoor wood-fired boiler tube tool in case of a locomotive-type boiler , a boiler barrel extends from the firebox and the hot gases pass through a bundle of fire tubes inside the barrel which greatly increases the heating surface compared to a single tube and further improves heat transfer flash boiler : a flash boiler is a specialized type of water-tube boiler in which tubes are close together and water is pumped through them desuperheater tubes or bundles : a series of tubes or bundles of tubes in the water drum or the steam drum designed to cool superheated steam , in order to supply auxiliary equipment that does not need , or may be damaged by , dry steam nuclear fission is also used as a heat source for generating steam , either directly ( bwr ) or , in most cases , in specialised heat exchangers called '' steam generators '' ( pwr ) in the event of a major rupture of the system , an ever-present hazard in a warship during combat , the enormous energy release of escaping superheated steam , expanding to more than 1600 times its confined volume , would be equivalent to a cataclysmic explosion , whose effects would be exacerbated by the steam release occurring in a confined space , such as a ship 's engine room in contrast to a '' subcritical boiler '' , a supercritical steam generator operates at such a high pressure ( over that the physical turbulence that characterizes boiling ceases to occur ; the fluid is neither liquid nor gas but a super-critical fluid to measure the boiler efficiency in indirect method , parameter like these are needed : ultimate analysis of fuel ( h 2 , s 2 , s , c , moisture constraint , ash constraint ) percentage of o 2 or co 2 at flue gas flue gas temperature at outlet ambient temperature in Â°c and humidity of air in kg/kg gcv of fuel in kcal/kg ash percentage in combustible fuel gcv of ash in kcal/kg this iron was often obtained from specialist ironworks , such as those in the cleator moor ( uk ) area , noted for the high quality of their rolled plate , which was especially suitable for use in critical applications such as high-pressure boilers as the name implies , this valve is usually located directly on the bottom of the boiler , and is occasionally opened to use the pressure in the boiler to push these particulates out because of this , steam is an efficient method of moving energy and heat around a site from a central boiler house to where it is needed , but without the right boiler feedwater treatment , a steam-raising plant will suffer from scale formation and corrosion boiler efficiency power out / power in ( q ( hg - hf ) ) / ( q gcv ) 100 % q rate of steam flow in kg/h hg enthalpy of saturated steam in kcal/kg hf enthalpy of feed water in kcal/kg q rate of fuel use in kg/h gcv gross calorific value in kcal/kg ( e.g in a fossil fuel power plant using a steam cycle for power generation , the primary heat source will be combustion of coal , oil , or natural gas top feed : in this design for feedwater injection , the water is fed to the top of the boiler in the 20th century , design practice moved towards the use of steel , with welded construction , which is stronger and cheaper , and can be fabricated more quickly and with less labour the pressure vessel of a boiler is usually made of steel ( or alloy steel ) , or historically of wrought iron in a flash boiler , the tube is kept so hot that the water feed is quickly flashed into steam and superheated however , the overall energy efficiency of the steam plant ( the combination of boiler , superheater , piping and machinery ) generally will be improved enough to more than offset the increased fuel consumption the steam piping is directed through the flue gas path in the boiler furnace , an area in which the temperature is typically between 225pxfire-tube boiler : here , water partially fills a boiler barrel with a small volume left above to accommodate the steam ( steam space ) for instance , the asme boiler and pressure vessel code is a standard providing a wide range of rules and directives to ensure compliance of the boilers and other pressure vessels with safety , security and design standards there are two methods to measure the boiler efficiency according asme performance test code ( ptc ) for boilers asme ptc 4 and for hrsg asme ptc 4.4 and en 12952-15 for water tube boilers : input output method ( direct method ) heat loss method ( indirect method ) the source of heat for a boiler is combustion of any of several fuels , such as wood , coal , oil , or natural gas historically , copper was often used for fireboxes ( particularly for steam locomotives ) , because of its better formability and higher thermal conductivity ; however , in more recent times , the high price of copper often makes this an uneconomic choice and cheaper substitutes ( such as steel ) are used instead if feed water is then sent into the empty boiler , the small cascade of incoming water instantly boils on contact with the superheated metal shell and leads to a violent explosion that can not be controlled even by safety steam valves
