: the surname kobilić could come from the slavic word kobila ( mare ) , and means '' mare 's son '' , as in serbian legends the hero is said to have been nursed by one jireček connected the surname to two noble families in medieval ragusa and trebinje , the kobilić and kobiljačić in the 14th and 15th centuries , and noted that they altered their surnames in the 18th century because they considered it '' indecent '' to be associated with mares miloš is often referred to in the epic poems as '' miloš of pocerje '' , and according to local legends , he came from the western serbian region of pocerina in pocerina there is a spring known as '' miloševa banja '' ( miloš 's spring ) and an old grave that is claimed to be the grave of miloš 's sister the earliest sources on the battle of kosovo , which generally favour the cult of prince lazar , do not mention miloš or his assassination of the sultan the killer is not named but he is described as one of twelve christian noblemen who managed to break through the ottoman ranks : : '' fortunate , most fortunate are those hands of the twelve loyal lords who , having opened their way with the sword and having penetrated the enemy lines and the circle of chained camels , heroically reached the tent of amurat murad himself the assassin 's first appearance in serbian sources is in the biography of stefan lazarević , lazar 's son , by constantine of kostenets , written in the 1440s in the early 15th century , for instance , the poet ahmedi writes that '' suddenly one of the christians , who was covered in blood and apparently hidden among the enemy dead , got up , rushed to murad and stabbed him with a dagger i̇nalcık argued that it was based on the testimony of a contemporary eyewitness of the battle , probably hoca omer , an envoy sent by the sultan to lazar before the battle in this work enveri explains that before he became a serbian nobleman , miloš ( miloš ban is how i̇nalcık rendered the name in enveri 's text ) was a muslim at the sultan 's court who deserted ottomans and abjured islam one historian from edirne , oruc bey , explains the lack of protection by saying that the army was preoccupied with pursuing the enemy in rear flight and introduces an element of deception : the christian '' had promised himself as a sacrifice and approached murad , who was sitting alone on his horse in 1976 , miodrag popović suggested that the narrative elements of secrecy and stratagem in the serbian tradition were all introduced from turkish sources , seeking to defame the capabilities of their christian opponents by attributing the death of the murat to '' devious '' methods '' it is important to note that neither this chronicle nor any of the other early serbian accounts of the battle attributes murad 's death to the hand of an assassin ( ) the theme of assassination , which appeared in the contemporary accounts of the battle from florence and siena and was also an important theme in all of the fifteenth century turkish sources for the battle , would eventually become a central element in the serbian epic ) it is surprising that the assassination of murad is not recorded in any of the serbian cult sources for the battle miloš obilić is a major hero of the serbian legend of kosovo , whose central part is the battle of kosovo the fully developed legend of kosovo , with all of its elements , is recorded in the tale of the battle of kosovo composed around the beginning of the 18th century in the bay of kotor or old montenegro the tale played a notable role in the awakening of national consciousness of the serbs in the habsburg monarchy , which began in the first half of the 18th century in a passage intended to infer a moral lesson about disloyalty from the serbian defeat at kosovo , mihailović identifies miloš kobica as the knight who on the fateful last friday of the battle slew murad '' radul-bey and bulgarian king šišman '' and the song '' dušan 's wedding '' ) , miloš obilić is often grouped along with other literary creations like karadjordje , vuk karadžić and njegoš as serbs of dinarides who distinguished themselves as the great moral and/or intellectual minds of the past in contradistinction to bulgarian contemporaries , who could claim no such status in the poem '' obilić dragon 's son '' , miloš is given a mythical ancestry as the son of a dragon to emphasise his superhuman strength on a physical and spiritual level ; in this , he joins the ranks of many other heroes of serbian poetry who fought against turkish oppression and are claimed to have been descendants of a dragon an earlier episode of miloš obilić 's career in the service of prince lazar is related to the battle of pločnik , in which he participated and survived an arrow wound in many sources he is mentioned as a son-in-law of prince lazar , which would make him a brother-in-law to vuk branković , another serbian high ranking nobleman and a prominent antagonist in epic traditions concerning the battle of kosovo other variants of songs and legends state that miloš was captured by a baba yaga ( a witch ) , who advised the turks how to kill miloš 's horse and find the keys of his armour , which were hidden in his moustache in folk epic and legends , miloš was celebrated as the hero of supernatural birth and strength ( his mother was a fairy , demonic creature or his father was a dragon ; he had got his strength from the milk of the mare ) it was not until the early 19th century that miloš was also venerated as a saint in the serbian church during the serbian revolution ( 1804–1815 ) , a fresco of miloš as a haloed , sword-bearing saint was painted in prince lazar 's narthex in the hilandar monastery on mount athos ( greece ) later in the same century , the heroic figure of miloš was given a national boost in the epic poem the mountain wreath ( 1847 ) by petar ii petrović-njegoš , prince-bishop of montenegro the poem praises the assassin 's valour in battle , calling him '' the victim of a noble feeling , / an all powerful military genius , / a dreadful thunder that smashes crowns '' a key event which gave expression to this idea was the 600th anniversary of the battle of kosovo ( vidovdan ) on 28 june 1989 , which was held at the gazimestan plain , near the site of the battle
