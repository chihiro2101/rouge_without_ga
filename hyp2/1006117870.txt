the sterile tissue between the lobes is called the connective , an extension of the filament containing conducting strands the stamens in a flower are collectively called the androecium the androecium can consist of as few as one-half stamen ( i.e stamen is the latin word meaning '' thread '' ( originally thread of the warp , in weaving ) from ἄνθος meaning '' flower '' androecium ( plural androecia ) derives from ancient greek ἀνήρ meaning '' man '' , and οἶκος meaning '' house '' or '' chamber/room '' depending on the species of plant , some or all of the stamens in a flower may be attached to the petals or to the floral axis the filaments may be fused and the anthers free , or the filaments free and the anthers fused pages 553–555 extreme cases of stamen fusion occur in some species of cyclanthera in the family cucurbitaceae and in section cyclanthera of genus phyllanthus ( family euphorbiaceae ) where the stamens form a ring around the gynoecium , with a single locule the microsporangia form sacs or pockets ( locules ) in the anther ( anther sacs or pollen sacs ) the pollen is eventually released when the anther forms openings ( dehisces ) these may consist of longitudinal slits , pores , as in the erica family ( ericaceae ) , or by valves , as in the barberry family ( berberidaceae ) pollen of angiosperms must be transported to the stigma , the receptive surface of the carpel , of a compatible flower , for successful pollination to occur in the typical flower ( that is , in the majority of flowering plant species ) each flower has both carpels and stamens a flower having only functional stamens and lacking functional carpels is called a staminate flower , or ( inaccurately ) male encyclopædia britannica.com a plant with only functional carpels is called pistillate , or ( inaccurately ) female the top part of the column is formed by the anther , which is covered by an anther cap simaroubaceae ( see diagram ) ; connective where the connective is very small , or imperceptible , the anther lobes are close together , and the connective is referred to as discrete , e.g stamens can be connate ( fused or joined in the same whorl ) as follows : extrorse : anther dehiscence directed away from the centre of the flower
