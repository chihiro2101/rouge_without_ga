most integrated circuits ( ics ) of sufficient complexity use a clock signal in order to synchronize different parts of the circuit , cycling at a rate slower than the worst-case internal propagation delays a clock signal might also be gated , that is , combined with a controlling signal that enables or disables the clock signal for a certain part of a circuit this technique is often used to save power by effectively shutting down portions of a digital circuit when they are not in use , but comes at a cost of increased complexity in timing analysis this allows the cpu to operate at a much higher frequency than the rest of the computer , which affords performance gains in situations where the cpu does not need to wait on an external factor ( like memory or input/output ) as long as the minimum and maximum clock periods are respected , the time between clock edges can vary widely from one edge to the next and back again devices that use static logic do not even have a maximum clock period ( or in other words , minimum clock frequency ) ; such devices can be slowed and paused indefinitely , then resumed at full clock speed at any later time such sine wave clocks are often differential signals , because this type of signal has twice the slew rate , and therefore half the timing uncertainty , of a single-ended signal with the same voltage range the most effective way to get the clock signal to every part of a chip that needs it , with the lowest skew , is a metal grid in a large microprocessor , the power used to drive the clock signal can be over 30 % of the total power used by the entire chip the clock distribution network ( or clock tree , when this network forms a tree ) distributes the clock signal ( s ) from a common point to all the elements that need it since this function is vital to the operation of a synchronous system , much attention has been given to the characteristics of these clock signals and the electrical networks used in their distribution finally , the control of any differences and uncertainty in the arrival times of the clock signals can severely limit the maximum performance of the entire system and create catastrophic race hazard in which an incorrect data signal may latch within a register the delay components that make up a general synchronous system are composed of the following three individual subsystems : the memory storage elements , the logic elements , and the clocking circuitry and distribution network
