in the post-medieval period , some natural waterways were '' canalised '' or improved for boat traffic in the 16th century the first act of parliament was obtained by the city of canterbury in 1515 , to extend navigation on the river stour in kent , followed by the river exe in 1539 , which led to the construction in 1566 of a new channel , the exeter canal the transport system that existed before the canals were built consisted of coastal shipping and horses and carts struggling along mostly unsurfaced mud roads ( although there were some surfaced turnpike roads ) chapter 2 : the river navigations in 1605 , the government of king james i established the oxford-burcot commission , which began to improve the system of locks and weirs on the river thames , which were opened between oxford and abingdon by 1635 in 1699 legislation was passed to permit the aire & calder navigation which was opened 1703 , and the trent navigation which was built by george hayne and opened in 1712 history of burton from 'british history online ' subsequently , the kennet built by john hore opened in 1723 , the mersey and irwell opened in 1725 , and the bristol avon in 1727 john smeaton was the engineer of the calder & hebble which opened in 1758 , and a series of eight pound locks was built to replace flash locks on the river thames between maidenhead and reading , beginning in 1772 by the early 18th century , river navigations such as the aire and calder navigation were becoming quite sophisticated , with pound locks and longer and longer '' cuts '' ( some with intermediate locks ) to avoid circuitous or difficult stretches of rivers eventually , the experience of building long multi-level cuts with their own locks gave rise to the idea of building a '' pure '' canal , a waterway designed on the basis of where goods needed to go , not where a river happened to be they supported the industries that allowed the country to become the world 's first industrial power and created the wealth that led to the british empire in the victorian era the sankey canal was the first british canal of the industrial revolution , opening in 1757 commercial horse-drawn canal boats could be seen on the uk 's canals until as late as the 1950s , although by then diesel powered boats , often towing a second unpowered boat , had become standard the period between the 1770s and the 1830s is often referred to as the '' golden age '' of british canals canal proposals were put forward by financial investors interested in profiting from dividends , as well as industrial businesses that wanted to move their raw materials and finished goods on the majority of british canals , the canal-owning companies did not own or run a fleet of boats , since the acts of parliament setting them up usually prohibited this , in order to prevent monopolies developing by the second half of the 19th century , many canals were increasingly becoming owned by railway company or competing with them , and many were in decline , with decreases in mile-ton charges to try to remain competitive sometimes this was a tactical move by railway companies to gain ground in their competitors ' territory , but sometimes canal companies were bought out either to close them down and remove competition , or to build a railway on the line of the canal the canals survived through the 19th century largely by occupying the niches in the transport market that the railways had missed , or by supplying local markets such as the coal-hungry factories and mills of the big cities during the 19th century in much of continental europe the canal systems of many countries such as france , germany and the netherlands were modernised and widened to take much larger boats this canal modernisation never occurred on a large scale in the uk , mainly because of the power of the railway companies who owned most of the canals and saw no reason to invest in a competing form of transport thus , almost uniquely in europe , many of the uk 's canals remain as they have been since the 18th and 19th century : mostly operated with narrowboats an exception to this stagnation was the manchester ship canal , newly built in the 1890s using the existing river irwell and river mersey , to take ocean-going ships into the centre of manchester via its neighbour salford most of the canal system and inland waterways were nationalised in 1948 and came under the control of the british transport commission , whose subsidiary , the docks and inland waterways executive , managed them into the 1950s a report in 1955 by the british transport commission placed the canals into three categories according to their economic prospects ; waterways to be developed , waterways to be retained , and waterways having insufficient commercial prospects to justify their retention for navigation under the transport act of 1962 , the canals were transferred in 1963 to the british waterways board ( bwb ) , which later became british waterways by this time the canal network had shrunk to 2,000 miles ( 3,000 & nbsp ; kilometres ) , half the size it was at its peak in the early 19th century there was no requirement to keep them in a navigable condition ; they were to be treated in the most economic way possible , which could mean abandonment in the 1960s the infant canal leisure industry was only just sufficient to prevent the closure of the remaining canals , but then the pressure to maintain canals for leisure purposes increased the anderton boat lift , the world 's first commercially successful boat lift and the only boat lift in the united kingdom the narrow locks on the trent and mersey limited the width ( beam ) of the boats ( which came to be called narrowboats ) , and thus limited the quantity of the cargo they could carry to around thirty tonnes many restoration projects have been led by local canal societies or trusts , who were initially formed to fight the closure of a remainder waterway or to save an abandoned canal from further decay squires ( 2008 ) , p.71 british waterways began to see the economic and social potential of canalside development , and moved from hostility towards restoration , through neutrality , towards a supportive stance today the great majority of canals in england and wales are managed by the canal & river trust which , unlike its predecessor british waterways , tries to have a more positive view of canal restoration and in some cases actively supports ongoing restoration projects such as the restoration projects on the manchester bolton & bury canal and the grantham canal there has also been a movement to redevelop canals in inner city areas , such as birmingham , manchester , salford and sheffield , which have both numerous waterways and urban blight in places , serious plans are in progress by the environment agency and the canal & river trust , see for building new canals to expand the network , link isolated sections , and create new leisure opportunities for navigating '' canal rings '' , for example the fens waterways link and the bedford and milton keynes waterway the bulk of the canal system was built in the industrial midlands and the northern england , where navigable rivers most needed extending and connecting , and heavy cargoes of manufactured goods , raw materials or coal most needed carrying ( 1998 ) hadfield 's british canals , sutton publishing ltd , in the nineteenth century , manchester 's merchants became dissatisfied with the poor service and high charges offered by the liverpool docks , and the near-monopoly of the railways they decided to bypass the liverpool monopoly on coastal trade by converting a section of the irwell into the manchester ship canal , which opened in 1894 , turning manchester into an inland port in its own right as early as the late 17th century , the aire and calder and calder and hebble navigations had been canalised , allowing navigation from leeds to the humber estuary , whereas the river don navigation connected sheffield to the humber later in the 18th century , the leeds and liverpool canal was constructed , creating an east-west link , giving access to the port at liverpool allowing export of finished goods ( 1983 ) lost canals & waterways of britain , sphere books ltd , the south west england had several east-west cross-country canals , which connected the river thames to the river severn and the river avon , allowing the cities of bristol and bath to be connected to london these were thames and severn canal which linked to the stroudwater navigation , the kennet and avon canal and the wilts and berks canal , which linked to these three rivers within scotland , the forth and clyde canal and the union canal connected the major cities in the industrial central belt ;
