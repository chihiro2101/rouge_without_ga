currently , the purposeful destruction of the memory of hatshepsut is seen as a measure designed to ensure a smooth succession for the son of thutmose iii , the future amenhotep ii , as opposed to any of the surviving relatives of hatshepsut who had an equal or better claim to the throne the northern route and the southern route , both of which went around the mountain , were judged by his council of war to be the safest , but thutmose , in an act of great bravery ( or so he boasts , but such self-praise is normal in egyptian texts ) , accused the council of cowardice and took a dangerous route

firmness , compressed it between four oar-shaped slips of wood , painted white , and placed , three inside the wrappings and one outside , under the bands which confined the winding-sheet maspero 's description of the body provides an idea as to the magnitude of the damage done : : his mummy was not securely hidden away , for towards the close of the 20th dynasty it was torn out of the coffin by robbers , who stripped it and rifled it of the jewels with which it was covered , injuring it in their haste to carry away the spoil in the iput-isut , the temple proper in the center , he rebuilt the hypostyle hall of his grandfather thutmose i , dismantled the red chapel of hatshepsut , built pylon vi , a shrine for the bark of amun in its place , and built an antechamber in front of it , the ceiling of which was supported by his heraldic pillars the size of the two forces is difficult to determine , but if , as redford suggests , the amount of time it took to move the army through the pass may be used to determine the size of the egyptian force , and if the number of sheep and goats captured may be used to determine the size of the canaanite force , then both armies were around

ramesses i , seti i , ramesses ii and ramesses ix , as well as the 21st dynasty pharaohs pinedjem i , pinedjem ii and siamun added to this is the fact that the monuments of hatshepsut were not damaged until at least 25 years after her death , late in the reign of thutmose iii when he was quite elderly according to the american egyptologist peter der manuelian , a statement in the tomb biography of an official named amenemheb establishes that thutmose iii died in year 54 , iii peret day 30 of his reign after ruling egypt for '' 53 years , 10 months and 26 days '' ( urk he is consistently regarded as one of the greatest of egypt 's warrior pharaohs who transformed egypt into an international superpower by creating an empire that stretched from the asian regions of southern syria and

not suffer at all from this rough treatment , and appeared intact when the protecting mask was removed he was in another coregency , this one with his son , who would become amenhotep ii , who is known to have attempted to identify the works of hatshepsut as his own although thutmose iii was a co-regent during this time , early historians have speculated that thutmose iii never forgave his stepmother for denying him access to the throne for the first two decades of his reign when hatshepsut died on the 10th day of the sixth month of thutmose iii 's 21st year , according to information

maspero was so disheartened at the state of the mummy and the prospect that all of the other mummies were similarly damaged ( as it turned out , few were in so poor a state ) that he would not unwrap another for several years these dates , just as all the dates of the eighteenth dynasty , are open to dispute because of uncertainty about the circumstances surrounding the recording of a sothic cycle of sirius in the reign of amenhotep i boston : ginn and company , 1914 , p.85 he is recorded to have captured 350 cities during his rule and conquered much of the near east from the euphrates to nubia during seventeen known military campaigns the forehead is abnormally low , the eyes deeply sunk , the jaw heavy , the lips thick , and the cheek-bones extremely prominent ; the whole recalling the physiognomy of thûtmosis ii , though with a greater show of energy his reign was also a period of great stylistic changes in the sculpture , paintings and reliefs associated with construction , much of it beginning during the reign of hatshepsut all the excess grain which was produced in syria was stored in the harbors he had recently conquered and was used for the support of the military and civilian egyptian presence ruling syria the decorations depict the pharaoh aiding the deities in defeating apep , the serpent of chaos , thereby helping to ensure the daily rebirth of the sun as well as the pharaoh 's own resurrection while it is popularly thought that his mummy originally was unwrapped by gaston maspero in 1886 , it was in fact first unwrapped by émile brugsch , the egyptologist who supervised the evacuation of the mummies from the deir el-bahri cache in 1881 after thutmose iii had taken control of the syrian cities , the obvious target for his eighth campaign was the state of mitanni , a hurrian country with an indo-aryan ruling class during this period of no opposition , thutmose put up a second stele commemorating his crossing of the euphrates next to the stele his grandfather , thutmose i , had put up several decades earlier . he may have fought the mitannians to a stalemate , yet he did receive tribute from the hittites after that campaign , which seems to indicate the outcome of the battle was in thutmose 's favor the cities in syria were not guided by the popular sentiment of the people so much as they were by the small number of nobles who were aligned to mitanni : a king and a small number of foreign maryannu a papyrus from amenhotep i 's reign records this astronomical observation which theoretically could be used to perfectly correlate the egyptian chronology with the modern calendar ; however , to do this the latitude where the observation was taken must also be known although there is no direct evidence for it , it is for this reason that some have supposed that thutmose 's sixth campaign , in his thirtieth year , commenced with a naval transportation of troops directly to byblos , bypassing canaan entirely although no king of egypt had ever penetrated so far with an army , previous kings ' campaigns had spread egyptian culture that far already , and the earliest egyptian document found at gebel barkal dates from three

campaigns of thutmose iii were directed against the phoenician cities in syria and against kadesh on the orontes until recently , a general theory has been that after the death of her husband thutmose ii , hatshepsut 'usurper ' the throne from thutmose iii two of the smaller rooms in this temple contained the reliefs of the survey of the plants and animals of canaan which he took in his third campaign thus , two obelisks of tuthmosis iii 's karnak temple stand in papal rome and in caesaropapist constantinople , the two main historical capitals of the roman empire . part of the tribute list for his 12th campaign remains immediately before his 13th begins , and the contents recorded , specifically wild game and certain minerals of uncertain identification , might indicate that it took place on the steppe around nukhashshe , but this remains mere speculation it also may be likely that this measure could not have been taken until the deaths of powerful religious and administrative officials who had served under both hatshepsut and thutmose iii beyond the euphrates , the assyrian , kassites and hittite kings all gave thutmose gifts , which he alleged to be '' tribute '' when he recorded it on the walls of karnak thutmose iii then went freely from city to city and pillaged them while the nobles hid in caves , or at least this is the typically propagandistic way egyptian records chose to record it although he followed the traditional relief styles for most of his reign , after his 42nd year he began having himself depicted wearing the red crown of lower egypt and a šndyt-kilt , an unprecedented style unlike many other examples from the deir el-bahri cache , the wooden mummiform coffin that contained the body was original to the pharaoh , though any gilding or decoration it might have had had been hacked off in antiquity however , recent research by scholars such as charles nims and peter dorman has re-examined these erasures and found that the acts of erasure which could be dated only began some time during year 46 or 47 of thutmose 's reign ( c the length of thutmose iii 's reign is known to the day thanks to information found in the tomb of the
