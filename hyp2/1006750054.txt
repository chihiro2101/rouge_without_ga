this was continued on the earliest bicycles with pedals , such as the boneshaker , which were fitted with a spoon brake to press onto the rear wheel however , as the rear wheel became smaller and smaller , with more of the rider 's weight over the front wheel , braking on the rear wheel became less effective with the introduction of mass-produced bicycle tire by the dunlop rubber , the use of spoon brakes began to decline , as they tended to quickly wear through the thin casing of the new tyres in the united states , the coaster brake was the most commonly fitted brake throughout the first half of the 20th century , often comprising the only braking system on the bicycle the spoon brake , or plunger brake was probably the first type of bicycle brake and precedes the pneumatic tyre whittbs , pp.153 & ndash ; 154 spoon brakes were used on penny farthings with solid rubber tyres in the 1800s and continued to be used after the introduction of the pneumatic-tyred safety bicycle though made obsolete by the introduction of the duck brake , coaster brake , and rod brake , spoon brakes continued to be used in the west supplementally on adult bicycles until the 1930s , and on children 's bicycles until the 1950s invented in 1897 , the duck brake or duck roller brake used a rod operated by a lever on the handlebar to pull twin friction rollers ( usually made of wood or rubber ) against the front tyre used in combination with a rear coaster brake , a cyclist of the day could stop much more quickly and with better modulation of braking effort than was possible using only a spoon brake or rear coaster brake 198-233 : the spoon brake was fairly ineffective , while the coaster brake did not operate on the front tyre , the most effective position on a two-wheel vehicle during a hard stop 4951 known colloquially as the duck brake , the design was used by many notable riders of the day , and was widely exported to england , australia , and other countries rim brakes are so called because braking force is applied by friction pads to the rim of the rotating wheel , thus slowing it and the bicycle because rims can carry debris from the ground to the brake pads , rim brakes are more prone to clogging with mud or snow than disc brakes ( where braking surfaces are higher from the ground ) , particularly when riding on unpaved surfaces the low price and ease of maintenance of rim brakes makes them popular in low- to mid-price commuter bikes , where the disadvantages are alleviated by the unchallenging conditions if a rim has a pronounced wobble , then the braking force may be intermittent or uneven , and the pads may rub the rims even when the brake is not applied in normal use this is not a problem , as the brakes are applied with limited force and for a short time , so the heat quickly dissipates to the surrounding air however , on a heavily laden bike on a long descent , heat energy may be added more quickly than it can dissipate causing heat build-up , which may damage components and cause brake failure many consist of a replaceable rubber pad held on a mounting , or brake shoe , with a post or bolt on the back to attach to the brake some are made as one piece with the attachment directly molded in the pad for lower production costs ; brake pads of the cartridge type are held in place by a metal split pin or threaded grub screw and can be replaced without moving the brake shoe from its alignment to the rim in general , a brake can be fitted with a variety of pads , as long as the mounting is compatible to minimise excessive rim wear , a brake pad should be hard enough that it does not embed road grit or chips of rim metal in the face of the pad , since these act as grinding/gouging agents and markedly reduce rim life the friction force between brake shoe and rim creates a bending moment around the point where the brake bolt emerges from the fork the '' rod-actuated brake '' , or simply '' rod brake '' , ( roller lever brake in raleigh terminology ) uses a series of rods and pivots , rather than bowden cables , to transmit force applied to a hand lever to pull friction pads upwards against the inner surface , which faces the hub , of the wheel rim rod brakes are used with a rim profile known as the westwood rim , which has a slightly concave area on the braking surface and lacks the flat outer surface required by brakes that apply the pads on opposite sides of the rim the caliper brake is a class of cable-actuated brake in which the brake mounts to a single point above the wheel , theoretically allowing the arms to auto-centre on the rim '' single-pivot side-pull caliper brakes '' consist of two curved arms that cross at a pivot above the wheel and hold the brake pads on opposite sides of the rim if not adjusted properly , low-quality varieties tend to rotate to one side during actuation and tend to stay there , making it difficult to evenly space brake shoes away from the rim dual-pivot brakes are slightly heavier than conventional side-pull calipers and can not accurately track an out-of-true rim , or a wheel that flexes from side to side in the frame during hard climbing the cable housing attaches to a fixed cable stop attached to the frame , and the inner cable bolts to a sliding piece ( called a '' braking delta '' , '' braking triangle '' , or '' yoke '' ) or a small pulley , over which runs a straddle cable connecting the two brake arms tension on the cable is evenly distributed to the two arms , preventing the brake from taking a '' set '' to one side or the other these brakes were reasonably priced , and in the past filled the price niche between the cheaper and the more expensive models of side-pull brakes the difference is that the two arm pivots attach directly to the frame or fork while those of the centre-pull caliper brake attach to an integral bridge frame that mounts to the frame or fork by a single bolt the u-brake 's main advantage over cantilever and linear-pull brakes in this application is that sideways protrusion of the brake and cable system is minimal , and the exposed parts are smooth the brake shoe is mounted above the pivot and is pressed against the rim as the two arms are drawn together due to a wider possible distance between the mounts and pads , cantilever brakes are often preferred for bicycles that use wide tyres , such as on mountain bikes it is a centre-pull cantilever design with an outwardly angled arm protruding on each side , a cable stop on the frame or fork to terminate the cable housing , and a straddle cable between the arms similar to centre-pull caliper brakes the cable from the brake lever pulls upwards on the straddle cable , causing the brake arms to rotate up and inward thus squeezing the rim between the brake pads '' linear-pull brakes '' or '' direct-pull brakes '' , commonly referred to by shimano 's trademark '' v-brakes '' , are a side-pull version of cantilever brakes and mount on the same frame bosses because the housing enters from vertically above one arm yet force must be transmitted laterally between arms , the flexible housing is extended by a rigid tube with a 90° bend known as the '' noodle '' ( a noodle with a 135° bend is used where the front brake is operated by the right hand , as this gives a smoother curve in the cable housing ) as a general rule , mechanical disc brakes for so-called '' flat bar '' bicycles ( chiefly mountain and hybrid bicycles ) are compatible with v-brake levers , whereas mechanical disc brakes intended for '' drop-bar '' bicycles are compatible with the cable pull of older brake designs ( cantilever , caliper , and u-brake ) on the downside , their shorter arms provide very small tyre and wheel clearance and generally make for a less forgiving setup : they can only accommodate smaller tyre sizes compared to cantilever brakes , may pose problems for mounting fenders , can be clogged more easily by mud , and they can make it harder to change wheels private communication by jeff archer of the museum of mountain bike art & technology roller cam brakes were used on early mountain bikes in the 1980s and into the 1990s , mounted to the fork blades and seat stays in the standard locations , as well as below the chain stays for improved stiffness as they do not protrude to interfere with the crank also a first-class cantilever , it uses a single-sided sliding cam ( the toggle ) an example of the toggle integral to the toggle cam brake appears here the cam surface is the upper edge of the 'tail ' on the large central piece the cable enters at the centre , pulls a corner of a parallelogram linkage housed inside the brake across two opposite corners , pushing out at the other two corners on to the brake arms above the pivots , so that the arms below the pivots push pads in against the rim however , with high leverage , the stroke of the lever is not enough to fully apply the brake , so the rider can have brakes that feel normal in light braking but which can not be applied harder for hard braking a disc brake consists of a metal disc , or '' rotor '' , attached to the wheel hub that rotates with the wheel many hydraulic disc brakes have a self-adjusting mechanism so as the brake pad wears , the pistons keep the distance from the pad to the disc consistent to maintain the same brake lever throw disc brakes tend to perform equally well in all conditions including water , mud , and snow due to several factors : the braking surface is farther from the ground and possible contaminants like mud which can coat or freeze on the rim and pads disc brakes may be made of materials that dissipate heat better than the wheel rim , but undersized sport sized discs will be too small to take advantage of the fact there are holes in the rotor , providing a path for water and debris to get out from under the pads it is possible to ride a bicycle with a buckled wheel if it has disc brakes , where it would not be possible with a rim brake because the buckled wheel would bind on the brake pads other reasons include : while all types of brakes will eventually wear out the braking surface , a brake disc is easier and cheaper to replace than a wheel rim or drum this is possible with disc brakes , so long as the rotor sizes are consistent and the frame has enough clearance ; with rim brakes , this would be impossible , as the different rim sizes would not allow the same rim brakes to work with a different sized wheel wheel size optionality with disc brakes allows the rider more options , including using a smaller diameter rim-sized wheel ( such as 27.5+ ) with a higher volume wider tire with the same outer diameter size as a larger rim-sized wheel ( such as 29 '' ) -- the outer diameter consistency is important as it preserves the geometry of the frame between the two different wheel sizes disc brakes require a hub built to accept the disc , and a fork ( for front brakes ) or frame ( for rear brakes ) built to accept the caliper a rim brake works directly on the rim and the attached tyre ; a disc brake applies a potentially large torque moment at the hub the latter has two main disadvantages : the torque moment must be transmitted to the tyre through the wheel components : flanges , spokes , nipples , and rim spoke bed an engineered disc brake would reduce weight by not having most of the metal rim components a front disc brake places a bending moment on the fork between the caliper anchor points and the tip of the dropout in order to counter this moment and to support the anchor points and weight of the caliper , the fork must be of a certain size ( most likely heavier ) as advantages of cable-actuated disc brakes are argued lower cost , lower maintenance , and lighter system weight , hydraulic disc brakes are said to offer more braking power and better control cable-actuated disc brakes were traditionally the only type of disc brake that could be used with the brake levers found on drop handlebars , sheldon brown , quoted at but this is no longer the case dual actuation can move both pads relative to the caliper , or can move one pad relative to the caliper , then move the caliper and other pad relative to the rotor , called a '' floating caliper '' design a limitation of the mount is that the location of the rotor is more constrained : it is possible to encounter incompatible hub/fork combinations , where the rotor is out of range the advantages of centerlock are that the splined interface is theoretically stiffer , and removing the disc is quicker because it only requires one lockring to be removed it is also common to use a larger diameter rotor on the front wheel and a smaller rotor on the rear wheel since the front wheel does the most braking ( up to 90 % of the total )
