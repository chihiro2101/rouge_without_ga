statistical significance dates to the 1700s , in the work of john arbuthnot and pierre-simon laplace , who computed the p-value for the human sex ratio at birth , assuming a null hypothesis of equal probability of male and female births ; see for details the significance level \alpha is the threshold for p below which the null hypothesis is rejected even though by assumption it were true , and something else is going on this means that \alpha is also the probability of mistakenly rejecting the null hypothesis , if the null hypothesis is true if the confidence interval does not include the value of zero effect , it can be assumed that there is a statistically significant result to determine whether a result is statistically significant , a researcher calculates a p-value , which is the probability of observing an effect of the same magnitude or more extreme given that the null hypothesis is true the null hypothesis is rejected if the p-value is less than ( or equal to ) a predetermined level , \alpha \alpha is also called the significance level , and is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis given that it is true ( a type i error ) for example , when \alpha is set to 5 % , the conditional probability of a type i error , given that the null hypothesis is true , is 5 % , and a statistically significant result is one where the observed p-value is less than ( or equal to ) 5 % these 5 % can be allocated to one side of the sampling distribution , as in a one-tailed test , or partitioned to both sides of the distribution , as in a two-tailed test , with each tail ( or rejection region ) containing 2.5 % of the distribution the use of a one-tailed test is dependent on whether the research question or alternative hypothesis specifies a direction such as whether a group of objects is heavier or the performance of students on an assessment is better a two-tailed test may still be used but it will be less powerful than a one-tailed test , because the rejection region for a one-tailed test is concentrated on one end of the null distribution and is twice the size ( 5 % vs in specific fields such as particle physics and manufacturing , statistical significance is often expressed in multiples of the standard deviation or sigma ( σ ) of a normal distribution , with significance thresholds set at a much stricter level ( e.g starting in the 2010s , some journals began questioning whether significance testing , and particularly using a threshold of 5 % , was being relied on too heavily as the primary measure of validity of a hypothesis other editors , commenting on this ban have noted : '' banning the reporting of p-values , as basic and applied social psychology recently did , is not going to solve the problem because it is merely treating a symptom of the problem in 2016 , the american statistical association ( asa ) published a statement on p-values , saying that '' the widespread use of 'statistical significance ' ( generally interpreted as p & nbsp ; ≤ 0.05 ' ) as a license for making a claim of a scientific finding ( or implied truth ) leads to considerable distortion of the scientific process '' other researchers responded that imposing a more stringent significance threshold would aggravate problems such as data dredging ; alternative propositions are thus to select and justify flexible p-value thresholds before collecting data , or to interpret p-values as continuous indices , thereby discarding thresholds and statistical significance in 2019 , over 800 statisticians and scientists signed a message calling for the abandonment of the term '' statistical significance '' in science , and the american statistical association published a further official statement declaring ( page 2 ) :
