23 the exact date of theobald 's birth is unknown ; the only clue to his age is that when he died in 1161 contemporaries considered him an old man , saltman theobald pp 401 theobald entered the abbey of bec in normandy as a benedictine monk in the late 11th or early 12th century , while william was the third abbot 5 no documents survive from theobald 's tenure as abbot , nor is there any information on the administration of the monastery during his period of office , except that 47 monks were admitted to bec while he was abbot theobald travelled to england on business for his abbey at least once during his abbacy , to supervise the monastery 's lands in england , a trip that took place shortly before his selection as the new archbishop of canterbury in 1138 in 1138 king stephen chose theobald to fill the vacant archbishopric of canterbury over stephen 's own brother henry , the bishop of winchester , who had helped stephen gain the throne of england 94–97 the election took place on 24 & nbsp ; december ; stephen was present with the papal legate , alberic of ostia , and a small group of barons and bishops , but henry was absent overseeing the ordination of deacons henry believed that theobald had been elected not only because of stephen 's concerns but also because waleran of meulan , the patronage of bec , was attempting to put his own man in one of the most powerful positions in england 91–92 although theobald was pious and well-educated , he had only become abbot the year before , and his election was probably influenced by the reputation of his monastery , which had already produced two archbishops of canterbury , lanfranc and anselm henry was appointed a papal legate on 1 march 1139 , greenway fasti ecclesiae anglicanae 1066–1300 : volume 2 : monastic cathedrals ( northern and southern provinces ) : winchester : bishops which meant that henry could now call church councils in england and had power equal to or exceeding that of theobald 411 theobald attended the council held by stephen in june 1139 that deprived roger of salisbury , bishop of salisbury , and his nephews nigel , bishop of ely , and alexander , bishop of lincoln , of their castles 72 according to most historians , theobald took little part in the controversy that followed the council , which eventually ended with roger 's death in 1139 and nigel and alexander 's restoration to favour they base their view on a vita , or life of the 12th-century mystic christina of markyate , which narrates the events and gives a more central role to theobald , instead of henry of blois , in challenging stephen 's arrest of the three bishops following king henry i 's death in 1135 the succession was disputed between the king 's nephews—stephen and his elder brother , theobald ii , count of champagne—and henry 's surviving legitimate child matilda , usually known as the empress matilda because of her first marriage to the german emperor , henry v all the magnates of england and normandy were required to declare fealty to matilda as henry 's heir , but when henry i died , stephen rushed to england and had himself crowned before either theobald ii or matilda could react but matilda was not resigned to the loss , and secured the support of the scottish king , david , her maternal uncle , and in 1138 the support of her half-brother , robert , earl of gloucester , an illegitimate son of henry i after consulting in person with stephen , he secured permission to accept the current conditions , and then joined henry of blois , who had switched sides , at winchester in april for a synod held to depose stephen and crown matilda as queen theobald 's dealings with henry of blois , the bishop of winchester , his suffragan bishop , were strained because of henry 's position as papal legate 19–22 before his death , celestine forbade theobald '' to allow any change to be made in the position of the english crown , since the transfer of it had been justly denounced , and the matter was still under dispute '' 62 this became the papal policy , and was a significant change from the recognition of stephen as king by pope innocent ii soon after stephen 's coronation in 1135 meanwhile , henry of blois had arrived in rome and begun negotiations with the new pope , lucius ii , over the elevation of the bishopric of winchester to an archbishopric theobald was back in paris in may 1147 to meet with the new pope , eugene iii ; among the issues probably discussed was theobald 's dispute with bernard of st david 's 24 but when eugene summoned the english bishops to the council of rheims in april 1148 the king forbade all of them from attending except for three he nominated : chichester , hereford and norwich 99 theobald had a number of reasons for defying the king : chiefly his obedience to the pope 's order commanding his attendance , but also to keep the papacy from favouring the newly elected archbishop of york , henry murdac , in the disputes between york and canterbury theobald appears to have reinstated most of the bishops quickly , as foliot wrote later in 1148 that only the bishops of winchester , durham , worcester , bath and exeter were still suspended 26–27 the king was angry with theobald for attending the council , even though the archbishop intervened with eugene , who was displeased with the king for forbidding the bishops ' attendance from there he conducted the ecclesiastical business of england , but theobald 's presence in the country posed a threat to stephen 's authority , and stephen quickly settled the differences between the two henry of blois had lost his legateship before celestine became pope , but it was not until about 1150 that theobald was appointed legate by eugene iii , perhaps owing to the exhortations of bernard of clairvaux 131 the council was attended by the king and eustace , the king 's eldest son , as well as other members of the nobility in january 1153 henry of anjou , matilda 's son , invaded england in pursuit of his claim to the throne , and with the death of eustace in august 1153 , stephen gave up theobald was also present when henry of anjou met with stephen 's second son william , probably after eustace 's death , to settle william 's lands and status after henry succeeded stephen 100–102 later it was mainly theobald and henry of blois who negotiated the treaty ending the civil war , as neither stephen nor henry of anjou was interested in a compromise for most of the remainder of theobald 's life he was occupied with ecclesiastical affairs in his diocese , as well as attending the royal court when henry was in england in 1156 , theobald supported the efforts of osbert de bayeux , who was accused of poisoning william the archbishop of york , to secure a trial for his alleged crimes in an ecclesiastical court rather than in the royal court 12 theobald called a church council at london in june 1160 , which dealt partly with the issues of the papal schism ; his health was poor and he had to be taken to the council in a litter at the time of theobald 's election there were about 140 monks in the chapter , and they seem to have expected that theobald , being a monk himself , would take their side in disputes and continue to support their needs the lack of services would have deprived the monks of income , and theobald 's threat had the desired effect , as jeremiah resigned his office and left christ church for st augustine 's abbey , canterbury theobald also had a dispute with st augustine 's abbey over the right of the archbishop to receive annual payments , and whether those payments were for sacraments performed by the archbishop , which would have been uncanonical , or were for other reasons 66–69 another dispute with st augustine 's concerned the right of the archbishops to have a say in the election of new abbots and whether or not the abbots would make a profession of obedience to the archbishops 73–75 the conflict re-surfaced in 1149 , when some of the monks of st augustine 's , led by their prior and sacrist , refused to obey the interdict placed on england by theobald and pope eugene iii when the previous abbot of st augustine 's died in 1151 , the prior , silvester , paid the king for the right to administer the abbey and to hold a free election for a new abbot 588 as well as st augustine 's , the abbots of a number of other monasteries in the diocese of canterbury are known to have professed obedience to theobald , as the documents recording the events survive he attempted to secure the right of gilbert foliot to remain abbot of gloucester after foliot 's election as bishop of hereford , but a new abbot was elected by the monks of gloucester theobald was more successful in securing the election of william , who had previously been a monk at christ church , to be abbot of evesham over the objections of some of the monks of evesham 81–85 theobald also became embroiled in the dispute between hilary , the bishop of chichester , and walter de lucy , the abbot of battle abbey , over hilary 's claims to jurisdiction over the abbey and the abbey 's counter-claims that it was exempt from episcopal supervision it was a minor setback for theobald when the case was eventually decided in battle 's favour , mainly on the basis of charters that were thought at the time to be genuine , but modern historians have come to believe were forged his first act in this area was the consecration of meurig as bishop of bangor in 1140 , during which meurig made a profession of obedience like those made by other bishops subject to canterbury 92–94 along with these consecrations , theobald 's legal efforts enabled him to withstand the attempts of bernard to turn st david 's into an archbishopric , and when bernard was succeeded by david fitzgerald in 1148 , theobald secured the new bishop 's profession of obedience to canterbury , thus ending the efforts to remove wales from canterbury 's jurisdiction also in 1148 , pope eugene decided in favour of canterbury and against the claims of st david 's , securing canterbury 's jurisdiction over wales 95 that , however , was the last assertion of the claim , as in 1152 the papal legate giovanni paparo reorganised the irish dioceses and settled the issue by appointing the archbishop of armagh the primate of ireland theobald obtained a vague confirmation of his see 's primacy from celestine ii in 1143–1144 , but at the council of reims in 1148 eugene clarified that this primacy did not affect the claims of york to be independent of canterbury because of the unsettled election disputes during the 1140s over the see of york , when it was contested between william of york and henry murdac , theobald faced little challenge from either william or murdac as to the traditional dispute between canterbury and york 6 theobald was instrumental in fostering the teaching of canon law in england ; the conflict that later arose between henry ii and thomas becket had its roots in disputes that were exposed during theobald 's time in office it was witnessed by the archbishop 's crossbearer , three of theobald 's nephews and the clerk who presumably was in charge of them , a chancellor , two chaplains who were monks , a butler , dispenser , chamberlain , steward , cook , usher , porter and marshal his coffin was opened in 1190 during repairs to the cathedral and his body was found to be uncorrupted , but efforts to secure his canonisation as a saint on the basis of that evidence were unsuccessful 595 although theobald was troubled by the opposition of his suffragan henry of blois , he regained control of the english church , secured the rights of his see , and helped maintain the unity of the realm
