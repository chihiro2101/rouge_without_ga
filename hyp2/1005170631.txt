thrombosis is generally defined by the type of blood vessel affected ( arterial or venous thrombosis ) and the precise location of the blood vessel or the organ supplied by it three factors are important in the formation of a blood clot within a deep veinâ€”these are the rate of blood flow , the thickness of the blood and qualities of the vessel wall paget-schroetter disease or upper extremity dvt ( uedvt ) is the obstruction of an arm vein ( such as the axillary vein or subclavian vein ) by a thrombus cerebral venous sinus thrombosis ( cvst ) is a rare form of stroke which results from the blockage of the dural venous sinuses by a thrombus cavernous sinus thrombosis is a specialised form of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis , where there is thrombosis of the cavernous sinus of the basal skull dura , due to the retrograde spread of infection and endothelial damage from the danger triangle of the face in most cases , arterial thrombosis follows rupture of atheroma ( a fat-rich deposit in the blood vessel wall ) , and is therefore referred to as atherothrombosis myocardial infarction ( mi ) or heart attack , is caused by ischemia , ( restriction in the blood supply ) , often due to the obstruction of a coronary artery by a thrombus causes of disturbed blood flow include stagnation of blood flow past the point of injury , or venous stasis which may occur in heart failure , or after long periods of sedentary behaviour , such as sitting on a long airplane flight also , atrial fibrillation , causes stagnant blood in the left atrium ( la ) , or left atrial appendage ( laa ) , and can lead to a thromboembolism cancers or malignancies such as leukemia may cause increased risk of thrombosis by possible activation of the coagulation system by cancer cells or secretion of procoagulant substances ( paraneoplastic syndrome ) , by external compression on a blood vessel when a solid tumor is present , or ( more rarely ) extension into the vasculature ( for example , renal cell cancers extending into the renal veins ) there are scores that correlate different aspects of patient data ( comorbidities , vital signs , and others ) to risk of thrombosis , such as the pompe-c , which stratifies risk of mortality due to pulmonary embolism in patients with cancer , who typically have higher rates of thrombosis for an occlusive thrombus ( defined as thrombosis within a small vessel that leads to complete occlusion ) , wound healing will reorganise the occlusive thrombus into collagenous scar tissue , where the scar tissue will either permanently obstruct the vessel , or contract down with myofibroblastic activity to unblock the lumen for a mural thrombus ( defined as a thrombus in a large vessel that restricts the blood flow but does not occlude completely ) , histological reorganisation of the thrombus does not occur via the classic wound healing mechanism instead , the platelet-derived growth factor degranulated by the clotted platelets will attract a layer of smooth muscle cells to cover the clot , and this layer of mural smooth muscle will be vascularised by the blood inside the vessel lumen rather than by the vasa vasorum ischemia/infarction : if an arterial thrombus can not be lysed by the body and it does not embolise , and if the thrombus is large enough to impair or occlude blood flow in the involved artery , then local ischemia or infarction will result in deep vein thrombosis this manifests as pain , redness , and swelling ; in retinal vein occlusion this may result in macular oedema and visual acuity impairment , which if severe enough can lead to blindness a thrombus may become detached and enter circulation as an embolus , finally lodging in and completely obstructing a blood vessel , which unless treated very quickly will lead to tissue necrosis ( an infarction ) in the area past the occlusion in people with a '' shunt '' ( a connection between the pulmonary and systemic circulation ) , either in the heart or in the lung , a venous clot can also end up in the arteries and cause arterial embolism arterial embolism can lead to obstruction of blood flow through the blood vessel that is obstructed by it , and lack of oxygen and nutrients ( ischemia ) of the downstream tissue in patients admitted for surgery , graded compression stockings are widely used , and in severe illness , prolonged immobility and in all orthopedic surgery , professional guidelines recommend low molecular weight heparin ( lmwh ) administration , mechanical calf compression or ( if all else is contraindicated and the patient has recently suffered deep vein thrombosis ) the insertion of a vena cava filter in patients with medical rather than surgical illness , lmwh too is known to prevent thrombosis , and in the united kingdom the chief medical officer has issued guidance to the effect that preventative measures should be used in medical patients , in anticipation of formal guidelines the treatment for thrombosis depends on whether it is in a vein or an artery , the impact on the person , and the risk of complications from treatment
