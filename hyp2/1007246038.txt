compounding edsel 's problems was the fact that the car had to compete with well-established nameplates from the big three , such as pontiac , oldsmobile , buick , dodge and desoto , as well as with its sister division mercury , which had never been a stellar sales success the vertical grille theme , while improved for the 1959 models , was discontinued for the 1960 models , which were similar to ford models of the same year , although coincidentally , the new front-end design was very similar to that of the 1959 pontiac mcnamara opposed the formation of the separate divisions for continental , lincoln , mercury , and edsel cars , and moved to consolidate lincoln , mercury , and edsel into the m-e-l division while edsel front end designs were considered '' weird '' or '' too different '' by contemporary buyers and critics , multiple automobile manufacturers ( such as pontiac , jaguar , bmw , subaru , lancia , alfa romeo , and saab ) have employed similar vertically-oriented grilles successfully in their car designs prior to the closure of the edsel division , the brand was intending to release the edsel comet compact for the 1960 model year , sharing a body with the ford falcon by 1958 , buyers had become fascinated with economy cars , and a large car like an edsel was seen as too expensive to buy and own the longer-wheelbase models , citation and corsair , were produced alongside the mercury products , while the shorter-wheelbase models , pacer and ranger , were produced alongside ford products edsels were equipped with powerful engines and offered brisk acceleration , but they also required premium fuel , and their fuel economy , especially in city driving , was poor even by late-1950s standards mcnamara was very much a throwback to henry ford in that , like the elder ford , mcnamara was committed to the ford marque to the almost total exclusion of the company 's other products workers assembling fords and mercurys often found the task of assembling the occasional edsel that moved down the line burdensome , because it required them to change tools and parts bins , then switch back to resume assembling fords or mercurys after completing assembly on edsels to make matters still worse , as a new make , edsel had no established brand loyalty with buyers , as its competing makes had by 1965 , the market for medium-priced cars had recovered , and this time , ford had the right car ; the galaxie 500 ltd beginning life as a design for the 1961 edsel ranger , the base trim of the meteor was designed with oblong taillamps ( switching to horizontal layout ) , derived from the 1960 ranger and comet ( designed as an edsel ) the motor was also not powerful enough to bring the car out of park while on a hill , so dealerships would instruct drivers to set the parking brake before pushing the park button while the edsel would cost ford over 250 million ( in 1958 dollars ) , the project would see longer-term benefits for the company , as ford invested over 100 million to build compact cars over the 1960s the final blow came in the fall of 1959 , when mcnamara convinced henry ford ii and the rest of ford 's management that edsel was doomed and that it was time to end production before edsel bled the company dry for 1962 , the full-size meteor was discontinued , with mercury shifting the nameplate to its newly-introduced intermediate car line ( becoming a counterpart of the ford fairlane through 1963 ) ford also ran internal studies to decide on a name , and even dispatched employees to stand outside movie theaters to poll audiences as to what their feelings were on several ideas thus , mcnamara had little use for the continental , lincoln , mercury and edsel brand cars made by the company many features included on edsels , such as self-adjusting brakes , climate control , gear selection by steering wheel buttons , etc attempting to capitalize on the emerging consumer interest in economy cars , american motors shifted its focus to its compact rambler models and discontinued its pre-merger brands , nash and hudson , after the 1957 model year ford motor company had conducted the right marketing study , but it came up with the wrong product to fill the gap between ford and mercury by the instruction of ernest breech , who was chairing a board meeting in the absence of henry ford ii , the car was finally called '' edsel '' in honor of edsel ford , former company president and son of henry ford moore 's unorthodox contributions ( among them '' utopian turtletop , '' '' pastelogram , '' '' turcotinga , '' '' resilient bullet , '' '' andante con moto '' and '' mongoose civique '' ) were meant to stir creative thought and were not officially authorized or contractual in nature early favorites for the name brand included citation , corsair , pacer , and ranger , which were ultimately chosen for the vehicle 's series names even though edsels shared basic technology with other ford cars of the era , a number of issues caused reliability problems , mostly with the 1958 models when the agency issued its report , citing over 6,000 possibilities , ford 's ernest breech commented that they had been hired to develop one name , not 6,000 consequently , the desired quality control of the different edsel models proved difficult to achieve , even when the fords and mercurys were satisfactorily assembled on the same lines but by the fall of 1957 , when edsels were introduced , the market had changed drastically
