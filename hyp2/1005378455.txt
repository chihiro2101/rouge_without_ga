his brother , jan tinbergen , won the first bank of sweden prize in economic sciences in memory of alfred nobel in 1969 after the war , tinbergen moved to england , where he taught at the university of oxford and was a fellow first at merton college , oxford and later at wolfson college , oxford british journal of the philosophy of science , 6 , 321–331 ( 1956 ) in particular , he was interested in explaining 'spontaneous ' behaviours : those that occurred in their complete form the first time they were performed and that seemed resistant to the effects of learning in this model , lorenz envisioned a reservoir with a spring valve at its base that an appropriate stimulus could act on , much like a weight on a scale pan pulling against a spring and releasing the reservoir of energy , an action which would lead an animal to express the desired behaviour in 1973 tinbergen , along with konrad lorenz and karl von frisch , were awarded the nobel prize in physiology or medicine '' for their discoveries concerning organization and elicitation of individual and social behaviour patterns '' in his nobel lecture , tinbergen addressed the somewhat unconventional decision of the nobel foundation to award the prize for physiology or medicine to three men who had until recently been regarded as '' mere animal watchers '' physiology or medicine : 1971–1980 19711980 , 113 ( 1992 ) the studies performed by the trio on fish , insects and birds laid the foundation for further studies on the importance of specific experiences during critical periods of normal development , as well as the effects of abnormal psychosocial situations in mammals at the time , these discoveries were stated to have caused '' a breakthrough in the understanding of the mechanisms behind various symptoms of psychiatric disease , such as anguish , compulsive obsession , stereotypic behaviour and catatonic posture '' the nobel prize for the introduction of ethology , or animal behaviour , as a new research field : possible implications for child development and behaviour : nobel prizes of importance to paediatrics tinbergen 's contribution to these studies included the testing of the hypotheses of lorenz/von frisch by means of '' comprehensive , careful , and ingenious experiments '' as well as his work on supernormal stimuli the nobel prize for the introduction of ethology , or animal behaviour , as a new research field : possible implications for child development and behaviour : nobel prizes of importance to paediatrics he was also awarded the godman-salvin medal in 1969 by the british ornithologists ' union , and in 1973 received the swammerdam medal and wilhelm bölsche medal ( from the genootschap ter bervordering van natuur- , genees- en heelkunde of the university of amsterdam and the kosmos-gesellschaft der naturfreunde respectively ) tinbergen described four questions he believed should be asked of any animal behaviour , diagram on the four areas of biology further diagrams on the four areas of biology by gerhard medicus ( documents no which were : causality ( mechanism ) : what are the stimuli that elicit the response , and how has it been modified by recent learning ? how do behaviour and psyche '' function '' on the molecular , physiological , neuro-ethological , cognitive and social level , and what do the relations between the levels look like ? ( compare : nicolai hartmann : '' the laws about the levels of complexity '' ) development ( ontogeny ) : how does the behaviour change with age , and what early experiences are necessary for the behaviour to be shown ? which developmental steps ( the ontogenesis follows an '' inner plan '' ) and which environmental factors play when / which role ? ( compare : recapitulation theory ) function ( adaptation ) : how does the behaviour impact on the animal 's chances of survival and reproduction ? evolution ( phylogeny ) : how does the behaviour compare with similar behaviour in related species , and how might it have arisen through the process of phylogeny ? why did structural associations ( behaviour can be seen as a '' time space structure '' ) evolve in this manner and not otherwise ? in ethology and sociobiology , causation and ontogeny are summarised as the '' proximate mechanisms '' , while adaptation and phylogeny are the '' ultimate mechanisms '' however , his interpretations of autistic behaviour , and the holding therapy that he recommended , lacked scientific support and the therapy has been described as controversial and potentially abusive , particularly by individuals with autism themselves patterns of behavior : konrad lorenz , niko tinbergen , and the founding of ethology
