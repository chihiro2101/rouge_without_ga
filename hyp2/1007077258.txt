interferometry makes use of the principle of superposition to combine waves in a way that will cause the result of their combination to have some meaningful property that is diagnostic of the original state of the waves this works because when two waves with the same frequency combine , the resulting intensity pattern is determined by the phase difference between the two waves—waves that are in phase will undergo constructive interference while waves that are out of phase will undergo destructive interference waves which are not completely in phase nor completely out of phase will have an intermediate intensity pattern , which can be used to determine their relative phase difference & nbsp ; 1 , the well-known michelson configuration ) a single incoming beam of coherent light will be split into two identical beams by a beam splitter ( a partially reflecting mirror ) if a single beam has been split along two paths , then the phase difference is diagnostic of anything that changes the phase along the paths the fringes can be interpreted as the result of interference between light coming from the two virtual images s & prime ; 1 and s & prime ; 2 of the original source s the characteristics of the interference pattern depend on the nature of the light source and the precise orientation of the mirrors and beam splitter & nbsp ; 2a , the optical elements are oriented so that s & prime ; 1 and s & prime ; 2 are in line with the observer , and the resulting interference pattern consists of circles centered on the normal to m 1 and m ' 2 & nbsp ; 2b , m 1 and m & prime ; 2 are tilted with respect to each other , the interference fringes will generally take the shape of conic sections ( hyperbolas ) , but if m & prime ; 1 and m & prime ; 2 overlap , the fringes near the axis will be straight , parallel , and equally spaced the central fringe representing equal path length may be light or dark depending on the number of phase inversions experienced by the two beams as they traverse the optical system the phase difference between the two beams results in a change in the intensity of the light on the detector the resulting intensity of the light after mixing of these two beams is measured , or the pattern of interference fringes is viewed or recorded the heterodyne technique is used for ( 1 ) shifting an input signal into a new frequency range as well as ( 2 ) amplifying a weak input signal ( assuming use of an active mixer ) the nonlinear combination of the input signals creates two new signals , one at the sum f 1 & nbsp ; + & nbsp ; f 2 of the two frequencies , and the other at the difference f 1 & nbsp ; − & nbsp ; f 2 the most important and widely used application of the heterodyne technique is in the superheterodyne receiver ( superhet ) , invented by u.s in this circuit , the incoming radio frequency signal from the antenna is mixed with a signal from a local oscillator ( lo ) and converted by the heterodyne technique to a lower fixed frequency signal called the intermediate frequency ( if ) after being perturbed by interaction with the sample under test , the sample beam is recombined with the reference beam to create an interference pattern which can then be interpreted spatially coherent light ) and , after allowing the two parts of the wavefront to travel through different paths , allows them to recombine if white light is used in young 's experiment , the result is a white central band of constructive interference corresponding to equal path length from the two slits , surrounded by a symmetrical pattern of colored fringes of diminishing intensity lloyd 's mirror generates interference fringes by combining direct light from a source ( blue lines ) and light from the source 's reflected image ( red lines ) from a mirror held at grazing incidence the reference flat is slightly beveled ( only a fraction of a degree of beveling is necessary ) to prevent the rear surface of the flat from producing interference fringes by adjusting the tilt , which adds a controlled phase gradient to the fringe pattern , one can control the spacing and direction of the fringes , so that one may obtain an easily interpreted series of nearly parallel fringes rather than a complex swirl of contour lines each of the well separated light paths is traversed only once , and the fringes can be adjusted so that they are localized in any desired plane if it is decided to produce fringes in white light , then , since white light has a limited coherence length , on the order of micrometre , great care must be taken to equalize the optical paths or no fringes will be visible the result is that light traveling an equal optical path length in the test and reference beams produces a white light fringe of constructive interference as the ray passes through the paired flats , it is multiply reflected to produce multiple transmitted rays which are collected by the focusing lens and brought to point a ' on the screen michelson and morley ( 1887 ) and other early experimentalists using interferometric techniques in an attempt to measure the properties of the luminiferous aether , used monochromatic light only for initially setting up their equipment , always switching to white light for the actual measurements in physics , one of the most important experiments of the late 19th century was the famous '' failed experiment '' of michelson and morley which provided evidence for special relativity
