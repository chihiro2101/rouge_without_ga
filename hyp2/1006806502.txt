bale , formerly a friar and ex-bishop of ossory , published from his place of exile at basle in 1554 an attack on the bishop , in which he speaks of him as among other things , '' the bloody sheep-bite of london '' and '' bloody bonner '' they include responsum et exhortatio in laudem sacerdotii ( 1553 ) ; articles to be enquired of in the general visitation of edmund bishop of london ( 1554 ) ; and ( 1555 ) , as well as a catechism , probably written by his chaplains , nicholas harpsfield and henry pendleton , entitled '' a profitable and necessary doctrine '' ( 1554 , 2d ed bonner resisted the visitation of august 1547 , and was committed to the fleet prison ; but he withdrew his opposition , and was released in time to take an active part against the government in the parliament of november 1547 after a struggle the protestant faction gained the upper hand , and on 7 february 1550 bonner 's deprivation was confirmed by the council sitting in the star chamber , and he was further condemned to perpetual imprisonment , where he remained until the accession of mary in 1553 lord acton in the cambridge modern history ( 1904 ) argued : '' the number of those put to death in his diocese of london was undoubtedly disproportionately large , but this would seem to have been more the result of the strength of the reforming element in the capital and in essex than of the employment of exceptional rigour ; while the evidence also shows that he himself patiently dealt with many of the protestants , and did his best to induce them to renounce what he conscientiously believed to be their errors '' his apologists , including defenders of catholicism in england , claim his actions were merely '' official '' , and that '' he had no control '' over the fate of the accused '' once they were declared to be irreclaimable heretics and handed over to the secular power ; but he always strove by gentle suasion first to reconcile them to the church '' ; the catholic encyclopedia estimates the number of persons executed as heretics in his jurisdiction as about 120 , rather than 300 his demeanor during his long imprisonment was remarkable for his cheerfulness , and even john jewel , the bishop of salisbury , describes him in a letter as '' a most courteous man and gentlemanly both in his manners and appearance '' ( zurich letters , i , 34 ) indeed , almost his first duty as bishop of london was to try heretics under these articles ; accusations of excessive cruelty and bias against the accused were spread broadcast by his enemies , and from the first he seems to have been unpopular in london he was almost as bitter against wyatt and mason , whom he denounced as a '' papist '' , and the violence of his conduct led francis i to threaten him with a hundred strokes of the halberd hitherto bonner had had a reputation as a somewhat coarse and unscrupulous tool of cromwell & ndash ; a sort of ecclesiastical wriothesley , he is not known to have protested against any of the changes effected by his masters ; he professed to be no theologian , and was in the habit , when asked technical questions , to refer his interrogators to the theologians thanks to the intervention of the spanish ambassador , action against the bishops was delayed ; but a year later , on 29 april 1564 , bonner was indicted on a charge of praemunire on refusing the oath when tendered him by his diocesan , robert horne ( bishop ) subsequently , he was transferred , perhaps through cromwell 's influence , to the service of the king , and in january 1532 he was sent to rome as the king 's agent when the question of the king 's divorce was raised he did so , but with such significant omissions in the matter which had been prescribed touching the king 's authority , that after a seven days ' trial he was deprived of his bishopric by an ecclesiastical court over which cranmer presided , and sent as a prisoner to the marshalsea 469 ) in north germany ; and in 1536 he wrote a preface to stephen gardiner 's de vera obedientia , which asserted the royal and denied the papal supremacy , and was received with delight by the lutherans '' bonner died in the marshalsea on 5 september 1569 , and was buried in st george 's , southwark , secretly at midnight to avoid the risk of a hostile demonstration both he and gardiner had in fact sought fresh licences to exercise their ecclesiastical jurisdiction from the young king edward vi ; and , if he was supreme enough to confer jurisdiction , he was supreme enough to issue the injunctions and order the visitation to which bonner objected during 1554 bonner carried out a visitation of his diocese , restoring the mass and the manifold practices and emblems of catholic life , but the work was carried out slowly and with difficulty in october 1533 he was entrusted with the task of suggesting to clement vii ( while he was the guest of francis i at marseille ) henry 's appeal from the pope to a general council ; but there seems to be no good authority for gilbert burnet 's story that clement threatened to have him burnt alive towards the end of 1535 he was sent to further what he called '' the cause of the gospel '' ( letters and papers , 1536 , no
