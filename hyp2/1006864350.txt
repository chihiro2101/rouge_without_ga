the work of leibniz also anticipated modern logic and analytic philosophy , but his philosophy also looks back to the scholastic tradition , in which conclusions are produced by applying reason to first principles or a priori definitions rather than to empirical evidence the monads are '' substantial forms of being '' with the following properties : they are eternal , indecomposable , individual , subject to their own laws , un-interacting , and each reflecting the entire universe in a pre-established harmony ( a historically important example of panpsychism ) wolff was one of the first to use german as a language of scholarly instruction and research , although he also wrote in latin , so that an international audience could , and did , read him a founding father of , among other fields , economics and public administration as academic disciplines , he concentrated especially in these fields , giving advice on practical matters to people in government , and stressing the professional nature of university education in 1781 , immanuel kant ( 1724–1804 ) published his critique of pure reason , in which he attempted to determine what we can and can not know through the use of reason independent of all experience briefly , he came to the conclusion that we could come to know an external world through experience , but that what we could know about it was limited by the limited terms in which the mind can think : if we can only comprehend things in terms of cause and effect , then we can only know causes and effects since the publication of his critique , immanuel kant has been considered one of the greatest influences in all of western philosophy the most prominent german idealists in the movement , besides kant , were johann gottlieb fichte ( 1762–1814 ) , friedrich wilhelm joseph schelling ( 1775–1854 ) and georg wilhelm friedrich hegel ( 1770–1831 ) who was the predominant figure in nineteenth century german philosophy , and the proponents of jena romanticism ; friedrich hölderlin ( 1770–1843 ) , novalis ( 1772–1801 ) , and karl wilhelm friedrich schlegel ( 1772–1829 ) '' august ludwig hülsen , friedrich heinrich jacobi , gottlob ernst schulze , karl leonhard reinhold , salomon maimon , friedrich schleiermacher , and arthur schopenhauer also made major contributions hegel was hugely influential throughout the nineteenth century ; by its end , according to bertrand russell , '' the leading academic philosophers , both in america and britain , were largely hegelian '' ; right hegelians among those influenced by hegel immediately after his death in 1831 two distinct groups can be roughly divided into the politically and religiously radical 'left ' , or 'young ' , hegelians and the more conservative 'right ' , or 'old ' , hegelians and here the master ’ s claim was viewed as paradox , at best ; the prussian regime indeed provided extensive civil and social services , good universities , high employment and some industrialization , but it was ranked as rather backward politically compared with the more liberal constitutional monarchies of france and britain philosophers within the camp of the hegelian right include : johann philipp gabler hermann friedrich wilhelm hinrichs karl daub heinrich leo leopold von henning heinrich gustav hotho other thinkers or historians who may be included among the hegelian right , with some reservations , include : johann karl friedrich rosenkranz eduard gans karl ludwig michelet philip marheineke wilhelm vatke johann eduard erdmann eduard zeller albert schwegler speculative theism was an 1830s movement closely related to but distinguished from right hegelianism ) , josiah royce for the twenty-first century : historical , ethical , and religious interpretations , lexington books , 2012 , p warren breckman , marx , the young hegelians , and the origins of radical social theory : dethroning the self , cambridge university press , 1999 , p ; young hegelians the young hegelians drew on hegel 's idea that the purpose and promise of history was the total negation of everything conducive to restricting freedom and reason ; and they proceeded to mount radical critiques , first of religion and then of the prussian political system they felt hegel 's apparent belief in the end of history conflicted with other aspects of his thought and that , contrary to his later thought , the dialectic was certainly not complete ; this they felt was ( painfully ) obvious given the irrationality of religious beliefs and the empirical lack of freedoms—especially political and religious freedoms—in existing prussian society they included ludwig feuerbach ( 1804–72 ) , david strauss ( 1808–74 ) , bruno bauer ( 1809–82 ) and max stirner ( 1806–56 ) among their ranks the term 'right hegelian ' , for example , was never actually used by those to whom it was later ascribed , namely , hegel 's direct successors at the fredrick william university ( now the humboldt university of berlin ) 48 ( dover page 616 ) , '' the ascetic tendency is certainly unmistakable in early christianity , as it was developed in the writings of the desert fathers from the kernel of the new testament ; this tendency is the highest point to which everything strives upwards to respond to this growing criticism , a group of philosophers greatly influenced by schopenhauer such as julius bahnsen ( 1830–81 ) , karl robert eduard von hartmann ( 1842–1906 ) , philipp mainländer ( 1841–76 ) , and even some of his personal acquaintances developed their own brand of pessimism , each in their own unique way neo-kantianism refers broadly to a revived type of philosophy along the lines of that laid down by immanuel kant in the 18th century , or more specifically by schopenhauer 's critique of the kantian philosophy in his work the world as will and representation , as well as by other post-kantian philosophers such as jakob friedrich fries ( 1773–1843 ) and johann friedrich herbart ( 1776–1841 ) in the early part of the 20th century , a group of german and austrian philosophers and scientists formed the vienna circle to promote scientific thought over hegelian system-building , which they saw as a bad influence on intellectual thought the group considered themselves logical positivists because they believed all knowledge is either derived through experience or arrived at through analytic statements , and they adopted the predicate logic of frege , as well as the early work of ludwig wittgenstein ( 1889–1951 ) as foundations to their work phenomenology began at the start of the 20th century with the descriptive psychology of franz brentano ( 1838–1917 ) , and then the transcendental phenomenology of edmund husserl ( 1859–1938 ) it was then transformed by martin heidegger ( 1889–1976 ) , whose famous book being and time ( 1927 ) applied phenomenology to ontology , and who , along with ludwig wittgenstein , is considered one of the most influential philosophers of the 20th century in the 19th century , friedrich schleiermacher ( 1768–1834 ) , wilhelm dilthey ( 1833–1911 ) and others expanded the discipline of hermeneutics beyond mere exegesis and turned it into a general humanistic discipline no longer was it conceived of as being about understanding linguistic communication , or providing a methodological basis for the human sciences - as far as heidegger was concerned , hermeneutics is ontology , dealing with the most fundamental conditions of man 's being in the world
