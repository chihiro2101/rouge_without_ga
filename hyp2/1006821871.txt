if the petals are free from one another in the corolla , the plant is polypetalous or choripetalous ; while if the petals are at least partially fused , it is gamopetalous or sympetalous for example , flowers on eudicots ( the largest group of dicots ) most frequently have four or five petals while flowers on monocots have three or six petals , although there are many exceptions to this rule if all of the petals are essentially identical in size and shape , the flower is said to be regular or actinomorphic ( meaning '' ray-formed '' ) in many plants of the asteraceae such as the sunflower , helianthus annuus , the circumference of the flower head is composed of ray florets in some plants such as narcissus the lower part of the petals or tepals are fused to form a floral cup ( hypanthium ) above the ovary , and from which the petals proper extend petal often consists of two parts : the upper , broad part , similar to leaf blade , also called the blade and the lower part , narrow , similar to leaf petiole , called the claw , separated from each other at the limb the genetics behind the formation of petals , in accordance with the abc model of flower development , are that sepals , petals , stamens , and carpels are modified versions of each other this develops competition between flowers and as a result flowers must provide incentives to appeal to pollinators ( unless the flower self-pollinates or is involved in wind pollination ) cares-suarez , r , poch , t , acevedo , r.f , acosta-bravo , i , pimentel , c , espinoza , c , cares , r.a , munoz , p , gonzalez , a.v , botto-mahan , c ( 2011 ) do pollinators respond in a dose-dependent manner to flower herbivory ? : an experimental assessment in loasa tricolor ( loasaceae ) gayana botanica , volume 68 , pages 176-181 using incentives flowers draw pollinators and set up a mutual relation between each other in which case the pollinators will remember to always guard and pollinate these flowers ( unless incentives are not consistently met and competition prevails ) various color traits are used by different petals that could attract pollinators that have poor smelling abilities , or that only come out at certain parts of the day in some petals , a distinction can be made between a lower narrowed , stalk-like basal part referred to as the claw , and a wider distal part referred to as the blade ( or limb ) many flowers contain a variety of shapes acting to aid with the landing of the visiting insect and also influence the insect to brush against anthers and stigmas ( parts of the flower ) an example is the tree fuchsia ( fuchsia excorticata ) which are green when needing to be pollinated and turn red for the birds to stop coming and pollinating the flower the dactylanthus has only its flowers pointing to the surface and the flowers lack color but have the advantage of containing much nectar and a strong scent
