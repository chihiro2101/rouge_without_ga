since the product design dictates multiple requirements on the supply chain , as mentioned previously , then once a product design is completed , it drives the structure of the supply chain , limiting the flexibility of engineers to generate and evaluate different ( and potentially more cost-effective ) supply-chain alternatives broadly , the success of the supply chain depends on the product design and the capabilities of the supply chain , but the reverse is also true : the success of the product depends on the supply chain that produces it a typical supply chain begins with the ecological , biological , and political regulation of natural resources , followed by the human extraction of raw material , and includes several production links ( e.g the term '' logistics '' applies to activities within one company or organization involving product distribution , whereas '' supply chain '' additionally encompasses manufacturing and procurement , and therefore has a much broader focus as it involves multiple enterprises ( including suppliers , manufacturers , and retailers ) working together to meet a customer need for a product or service resilience in supply chains is defined as '' the capability of the firm to be alert to , adapt to , and quickly respond to changes brought by a supply chain disruption '' many of the exchanges encountered in the supply chain are therefore between different companies that seek to maximize their revenue within their sphere of interest but may have little or no knowledge or interest in the remaining players in the supply chain the product design affects the associated supply chain and its requirements directly , including manufacturing , transportation , quality , quantity , production schedule , material selection , production technologies , production policies , regulations , and laws if all relevant information is accessible to any relevant company , every company in the supply chain has the ability to help optimize the entire supply chain rather than to sub-optimize based on local optimization , so why do we call it a 'supply chain ' anyway ? , industry week , emphasis added , published 3 december 2012 , accessed 6 january 2021 a chain is actually a complex and dynamic supply and demand network more recently , the loosely coupled , self-organizing network of businesses who cooperate to provide product and service offerings has been called the extended enterprise , and the use of the term '' chain '' and the linear structure it appears to represent have been criticised as '' harder to relate it was the first model to report that '' the optimal position of the supply chain delivery window , which is necessary to achieve supply chain resilience , is neither determined by penalty cost per time unit late nor by the penalty cost per time unit early but by their ratio a lack of transparency in the supply chain is known as mystification , which bars consumers from the knowledge of where their purchases originated and can enable socially irresponsible practices the basic idea behind scm is that companies and corporations involve themselves in a supply chain by exchanging information about market fluctuations and production capabilities it includes delivery and order fulfillment performance , production flexibility , warranty and returns processing costs , inventory and asset turns , and other factors in evaluating the overall effective performance of a supply chain the primary objective of scm is to fulfill customer demands through the most efficient use of resources , including distribution capacity , inventory , and labor various aspects of supply chain optimization include liaising with suppliers to eliminate bottlenecks ; sourcing strategically to strike a balance between lowest material cost and transportation , implementing just-in-time techniques to optimize manufacturing flow ; maintaining the right mix and location of factories and warehouses to serve customer markets ; and using location allocation , vehicle routing analysis , dynamic programming , and traditional logistics optimization to maximize the efficiency of distribution in this context , demand generation is used to define how attractive a product design is in terms of creating demand
