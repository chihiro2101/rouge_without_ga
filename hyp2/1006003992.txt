seebass and george also worked on the problem from a different angle , trying to spread out the n-wave laterally and temporally ( longitudinally ) , by producing a strong and downwards-focused ( sr-71 blackbird , boeing x-43 ) shock at a sharp , but wide angle nose cone , which will travel at slightly supersonic speed ( bow shock ) , and using a swept back flying wing or an oblique wing to smooth out this shock along the direction of flight ( the tail of the shock travels at sonic speed ) these waves travel at the speed of sound and , as the speed of the object increases , the waves are forced together , or compressed , because they can not get out of each other 's way quickly enough when an aircraft passes through the air , it creates a series of p-wave in front of the aircraft and behind it , similar to the bow wave created by a boat for example , the speed of sound at is about , but an aircraft must travel at least ( mach 1.12 , where mach 1 equals the speed of sound ) for a boom to be heard on the ground it is a common misconception that only one boom is generated during the subsonic to supersonic transition ; rather , the boom is continuous along the boom carpet for the entire supersonic flight because the different radial directions around the aircraft 's direction of travel are equivalent ( given the '' smooth flight '' condition ) , the shock wave forms a mach cone , similar to a vapour cone , with the aircraft at its tip the quiet spike is a telescoping boom fitted to the nose of an aircraft specifically designed to weaken the strength of the shock waves forming on the nose of the aircraft at supersonic speeds ground width of the boom exposure area is approximately for each of altitude ( the width is about five times the altitude ) ; that is , an aircraft flying supersonic at will create a lateral boom spread of about until such metrics can be established , either through further study or supersonic overflight testing , it is doubtful that legislation will be enacted to remove the current prohibition on supersonic overflight in place in several countries , including the united states therefore , for a boom to reach the ground , the aircraft speed relative to the ground must be greater than the speed of sound at the ground eventually they merge into a single shock wave , which travels at the speed of sound , a critical speed known as mach 1 , and is approximately at sea level and are working together to build an experimental aircraft called the low boom flight demonstrator ( lbfd ) , which will reduce the sonic boom synonymous with high-speed flight to the sound of a car door closing for steady supersonic flight , the boom is described as a carpet boom since it moves with the aircraft as it maintains supersonic speed and altitude the end of the whip , known as the '' cracker '' , moves faster than the speed of sound , thus creating a sonic boom to adapt this principle to existing planes , which generate a shock at their nose cone and an even stronger one at their wing leading edge , the fuselage below the wing is shaped according to the area rule the sound of a sonic boom depends largely on the distance between the observer and the aircraft shape producing the sonic boom the energy range of sonic boom is concentrated in the 0.1â€“100 & nbsp ; hertz frequency range that is considerably below that of subsonic aircraft , gunshot and most industrial noise in the late 1950s when supersonic transport ( sst ) designs were being actively pursued , it was thought that although the boom would be very large , the problems could be avoided by flying higher
