the earliest reference to a meal of the type referred to as agape is in paul the apostle 's first epistle to the corinthians , although the term can only be inferred vaguely from its prominence in 1 cor 13 perhaps predictably enough , it could at times deteriorate into merely an occasion for eating and drinking , or for ostentatious displays by the wealthier members of the community , as happened in corinth , drawing the criticisms of paul : '' i hear that when you come together as a church , there are divisions among you , and to some extent i believe it do n't you have homes to eat and drink in ? or do you despise the church of god and humiliate those who have nothing ? '' the term agape ( ἀγάπη ) is also used in reference to meals in and according to a few manuscripts of soon after the year 100 , ignatius of antioch refers to the agape feast in letter 97 to trajan , pliny the younger perhaps indicates , in about 112 , that such a meal was normally taken separately from the eucharistic celebration ( although he is silent about its nomenclature ) : he speaks of the christians separating after having offered prayer , on the morning of a fixed day , to christ as god , and reassembling later for a common meal '' they met on a stated day before it was light , and addressed a form of prayer to christ , as to a divinity , binding themselves by a solemn oath , not for the purposes of any wicked design , but never to commit any fraud , theft , or adultery , never to falsify their word , nor deny a trust when they should be called upon to deliver it up ; after which it was their custom to separate , and then reassemble , to eat in common a harmless meal '' reiterated the prohibition of feasting in churches , and the trullan council of 692 decreed that honey and milk were not to be offered on the altar ( canon 57 ) , and that those who held love feasts in churches should be excommunicated ( canon 74 ) one such group was the schwarzenau brethren ( 1708 ) who counted a lovefeast consisting of feet-washing , the agape meal , and the eucharist among their '' outward yet sacred '' ordinances the schwarzenau brethren groups ( the largest being the church of the brethren ) regularly practice agape feasts ( called '' love feast '' ) , which include feetwashing , a supper , and communion , with hymns and brief scriptural meditations interspersed throughout the worship service groups that descend from the schwarzenau brethren such as the church of the brethren , brethren church , old german baptist brethren , and dunkard brethren regularly practice a lovefeast based on new testament descriptions of the last supper the lovefeast of the moravian church is based on the agape feast and the meals of the early churches described in the bible in the acts of the apostles , which were partaken in unity and love traditionally for european , canadian , and american lovefeasts , a sweetened bun and coffee ( sweetened milky tea in germany , the netherlands , and england ) is served to the congregation in the pews by dieners ( from the german for 'servers ' ) ; before partaking , a simple table grace is said some of these notable dates include watch night , good friday , the festival of 13 august ( the 1727 date on which the moravian church was renewed or reborn ) , and christmas eve , where each member of the congregation receives a lighted candle at the end of the service in addition to the bun and coffee several methodist hymns were written for this christian ritual , including charles wesley 's '' the love-feast '' , penned in 1740 : the christian liturgical books of the african methodist episcopal church , african methodist episcopal zion church , christian methodist episcopal church , and united methodist church all have services for the lovefeast
