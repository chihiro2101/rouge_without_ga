in the italian model of ams , used from 1993 to 2005 , for every constituency seat won by a party , that party 's vote total was reduced by the number of votes received by the second-place candidate in the constituency , subject to the condition that the deduction can not be less than either 25 % of the total votes cast in the constituency , or the votes received by the winning candidate , whichever is less however the elections for the london assembly have a threshold of 5 % which has at times denied seats to the christian peoples alliance ( in the 2000 election ) , the british national party , respect – the unity coalition ( both in the 2004 election ) , and the women 's equality party ( in the 2016 election ) since smaller parties are likely , in compensatory systems , to win a larger number of proportional seats , such additional member systems could hand additional political power to the leaders of these parties at the expense of regional directly elected representatives , unless the additional members are elected on an open regional list or a closed regional list as in scotland and wales for instance in the 2001 italian general election , one of the two main coalitions ( the house of freedoms coalition , which opposed the mmp system ) linked many of their constituency candidates to a decoy list ( liste civetta ) in the proportional parts , under the name abolizione scorporo in the run up to the 2007 scottish election , the labour party had considered not fielding list candidates in the glasgow , west of scotland , and central scotland regions , as their constituency strength in the previous two elections had resulted in no list msps ; instead they proposed to support a list composed of co-operative party candidates it was used from 1993 to 2005 in italy : the chamber of deputies , even if decoy lists changed de facto the electoral system into a pure parallel voting the italian senate , with a particular single-vote variant : proportional representation was automatically calculated upon all losers in the fptp races , and candidates with best percentages were elected in 1976 , the hansard society recommended that a mixed electoral system in a form different from the german be used for uk parliamentary elections , but instead of using closed party lists , it proposed that seats be filled by the '' best runner-up '' basis used by the german state of baden-württemberg , where the compensatory seats are filled by the party 's defeated candidates who were the 'best near-winner ' in each of the state 's four regions report of the hansard society commission on electoral reform , hansard society , 1976 it was the way that compensatory seats were allocated that made their report the origin of the additional member system , the term which the report also invented , which was then applied along with the much older '' mixed system '' by english-speaking writers on voting systems to west germany 's system and similar models until mixed member proportional ( mmp ) was invented for the adoption of the german system proposed for new zealand in a royal commission report in 1986 , which would explain why ams and mmp have been used as synonyms the system the hansard society proposed was eventually adopted but with closed lists instead of the '' best runner-up '' ( popularly known in britain as '' best losers '' ) provision for elections to the scottish parliament , welsh parliament and london assembly , but not for that proposed for elections to the house of commons the system implemented for the scottish parliament is known to make it more difficult for any one party to win an outright majority , compared to the first-past-the-post system used for general elections to the uk parliament in westminster in the first election for scotland 's new parliament , the majority of voters surveyed misunderstood some key aspects of the difference there between the '' first '' ( constituency ) vote and the '' second '' ( regional list ) vote ; indeed in some ways the understanding worsened in the second election
