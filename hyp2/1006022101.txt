a weir will increase the depth of a shallow stretch , and the required lock will either be built in a gap in the weir , or at the downstream end of an artificial cut which bypasses the weir and perhaps a shallow stretch of river below it on some flights of locks with short intermediate pounds , the pounds are extended sideways – in effect to provide a reservoir to ensure that the pound does not run dry ( in case , for instance , the lock below leaks more than the lock above ) an inclined plane consists of a cradle ( to hold a barge ) or caisson ( a box full of water in which a barge can float ) which moves on rails sideways up a slope from one waterway to the other another derivative is the peterborough lift lock which is a boat lift located on the trent canal in the city of peterborough , ontario , canada and is lock 21 on the trent-severn waterway the proposal is for a long tube of reinforced concrete , of a size to accommodate the boats being lifted , to be built on the slope between the upper and lower levels when a stretch of river is made navigable , a lock is sometimes required to bypass an obstruction such as a rapid , dam , or mill weir – because of the change in river level across the obstacle since the box is '' wet '' ( filled with water ) , archimedes ' principle ensures that the caisson always weighs the same , regardless of the size of boat being carried ( or even if it contains only water ) the boat is secured to the cradle , possibly by raising slings under the hull using hydraulics , and the cradle is hauled out of the water and up the hill with a cable the vessel floats on the surface of the water , with a guide float or pontoon , shaped to fit the tube , floating alongside to keep it clear of the walls as the lock is emptied water is run into each chamber in turn , for filling the water is released from the chambers thus saving the waste of a complete lockfull of water possibly inspired by weldon 's caisson lock , william congreve in 1813 patented a '' hydro-pneumatic double balance lock '' in which two adjacent locks containing pneumatic caissons could be raised and lowered in counterbalance by the movement of compressed air from one caisson to the other there are no working waterway inclined planes in the uk at the moment , but the remains of a famous one can be seen at foxton in leicestershire on the leicester arm of the grand union canal the bottom of the tube is sealed with a strong watertight door , but there is a single pair of conventional lock gates at the top , installed a boat 's length from the far wall of the tube as well as the '' static '' approaches mentioned earlier ( various types of contouring , excavating , and spanning ) , there were many ingenious '' dynamic '' solutions , mostly variations on the boat lift or the inclined plane the longer the cut , the greater the difference in river level between start and end of the cut , so that a very long cut will need additional locks along its length the plane enabled wide-beam boats to bypass the flight of ten narrow locks , but failure to make improvements at the other end of the arm and high running costs led to its early demise deepest canal locks in england interactive simulation of lock operation – this demonstration shows guillotine lock for clarity interactive lock game for students with single and double flight locks and lesson plans video footage of the unique drop lock at dalmuir on the forth & clyde canal one of these '' locks '' was built and demonstrated to the prince regent ( later george iv ) , but it had various engineering problems and the design was not put into use on the coal canal in some locations , such as the big chute marine railway on the trent-severn waterway , in ontario , canada , a marine railway was installed as a temporary measure at the planned site of a flight of conventional locks instead , the boat entered the box and was sealed in by the door closing behind it , and the box itself was moved up or down through the water the victorian anderton boat lift , the world 's first vertical boat lift , linking the trent and mersey canal and the river weaver in cheshire , was reopened in 2002 a marine railway is similar to a canal inclined plane in that it moves boats up or down a slope on rails
