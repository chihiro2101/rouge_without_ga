a modular synthesizer has a case or frame into which arbitrary modules can be fitted ; modules are usually connected together using patch cords and a system may include modules from different sources , as long as it fits the form factors of the case and uses the same electrical specifications the different modules of a semi-modular synthesizer are wired together into a typical configuration , but can be re-wired by the user using patch cords however , the manufacturer provides mechanisms to allow the user to connect modules in different orders and often to connect external components or modules ( chosen and supplied by the user ) between those of the instrument many fully digital synthesizers , like the alesis ion , make use of the logic and nomenclature of a '' modulation matrix '' , even when the graphical layout of a hardware matrix is completely absent there are some standards which manufacturers followed for their range of physical synthesizers , such as 1v/octave control voltages , and gate / trigger thresholds providing general compatibility ; however , connecting synthesizers from different manufacturers may require cables with different kinds of plugs since the late 1990s , there has been a resurgence in the popularity of analog synthesizers aided by physical standardization practices , an increase in 'retro ' gear and interest , decreased production costs and increased electronic reliability and stability , the rediscovered ability of modules to control things other than sound , and a generally heightened education through the development of virtual synthesis systems such as vcv rack , max/msp , pd and reaktor etc however , there continued to be a community who chose the physically patched approach , the flexibility and the sound of traditional modular systems the difference between a synthesizer module and an effects unit is that an effects unit will have sockets for input and output of the audio signal and knobs or switches for the musician to control various parameters of the device ( for example , the rate of a chorus pedal ) while a synthesizer module may have sockets for input and output , but will also have sockets so that the device 's parameters can be further controlled by other devices/modules ( for example , to connect an external low frequency oscillator to a delay module to get the chorus effect some examples include the voltage controlled oscillator ( vco ) , which may have options for sync ( hard or soft ) , linear or exponential frequency modulation , and variable waveshape ; the voltage controlled filter ( vcf ) that may have both resonance and bandwidth controls ; and the envelope follower which may provide outputs at each stage of the process by the 1990s , modular synthesizers had fallen out of favor compared to cheaper , smaller digital and software synthesizers in the late 1970s , modular synthesizers started to be largely supplanted in pop music by highly integrated keyboard synthesizers , racks of midi-connected gear , and samplers some standard modules found on almost any modular synthesizer are : sources - characterized by an output , but no signal input ; it may have control inputs : vco – voltage-controlled oscillator , a continuous voltage source , which will output a signal whose frequency is a function of the settings usually it controls the amplitude of a vca or the cutoff frequency of a vcf , but the patchable structure of the synthesizer makes it possible to use the envelope generator to modulate other parameters such as the frequency or pulse width of the vco german engineer dieter doepfer believed modular synthesizers could still be useful for creating unique sounds , and created the a new , smaller modular system , the doepfer a-100 this led to a new standard for modular systems , eurorack ; as of 2017 , over 100 companies , including moog and roland , were developing eurorack modules modules with the same basic functions may have different inputs , outputs and controls , depending on their degree of complexity the moog was composed of separate modules which created and shaped sounds , such as envelopes , noise generator , filters , and sequencers , pinch , trevor ; trocco , frank ( 2004 ) for example , modulating a vco will produce frequency modulation , and may create vibrato , while modulating a vca will produce amplitude modulation , and may create vibrato , depending on the control frequency other differences are in the plugs used , which can match 1/4-inch or 6.3mm jacks , 3.5mm jacks , banana jacks , or breadboard patch leads , in the main power supply , which is most often ±12 & nbsp ; v or ±15 & nbsp ; v , but can range from 2.5±2.5 & nbsp ; v to 0±18 & nbsp ; v for different manufacturers or systems , in the trigger or gate voltages ( moog s-trigger or positive gate ) , with typical audio signal levels ( often ±5 & nbsp ; v with ±5 & nbsp ; v headroom ) , and with control voltages of volts/octave ( typically 1 & nbsp ; v/octave , but in some cases 1.2 & nbsp ; v/octave while potentially lacking the physical presence of desirable analog sound generation , real voltage manipulation , knobs , sliders , cables , and leds , software modular synthesizers offer the infinite variations and visual patching at a more affordable price and in a compact form factor in digital times the clean logical layout of these matrices has inspired a number of manufacturers like arturia to include digitally programmable matrices in their analog or virtual analog synthesizers due to the continuously variable nature of knobs and sliders , reproducing an exact patch can be difficult or next to impossible designs may allow for stepping forwards or backwards , oscillating patterns , random order , or only using a limited number of stages
