in hot , flat , and crowded , he says that '' any car company that gets taxpayer money must demonstrate a plan for transforming every vehicle in its fleet to a hybrid electric with flex-fuel capability , so its entire fleet can also run on next generation cellulosic ethanol '' friedman has been criticized by organizations such as fairness and accuracy in reporting for defending israeli airstrikes in lebanon as a form of '' educating '' israel 's opponents ; according to fair , friedman was explicitly endorsing terrorism by israel against lebanese and palestinians among other criticisms , fernandez singles out friedman 's suggestion that israeli forces were unaware that their allied lebanese militias carried out the sabra and shatila massacre while under their guard , contradicting the assessments of other journalists and observers ; his encouragement of strong-armed force by the israeli army against palestinians ; and his opposition to settlements only on the grounds that they are counter-productive , rather than because they violate international law or cause suffering for palestinians friedman responded to criticism by writing : '' in retrospect i probably should have used a more precise term like 'engineered ' by the israel lobby – a term that does not suggest grand conspiracy theories that i do n't subscribe to in september 2009 , friedman wrote an article praising china 's one-party autocracy , saying that it was '' led by a reasonably enlightened group of people '' and that china 's leaders are '' boosting gasoline prices '' and '' overtaking us in electric cars , solar power , energy efficiency , batteries , nuclear power and wind power '' the article was in turn subject to critical analysis : matt lewis who wrote , '' friedman 's apparent wish for a 'benign ' dictator is utopian , inasmuch as it ignores lord acton 's warning that 'absolute power corrupts absolutely ' '' and william easterly who quotes friedman 's one-party autocracy assertions as part of his academic paper in which he concluded that , '' formal theory and evidence provides little or no basis on which to believe the benevolent autocrat story '' and that , '' economists should retain their traditional skepticism for stories that have little good theory or empirics to support them '' however , in a july 2012 article in the nyt , he also wrote that the current chinese leadership has not used its surging economic growth to also introduce gradual political reform and that , '' corruption is as bad as ever , institutionalized transparency and rule of law remain weak and consensual politics nonexistent '' when asked if he had '' china envy '' during a fresh dialogues interview , friedman replied , '' you detect the envy of someone who wants his own government to act democratically with the same effectiveness that china can do autocratically '' likewise , in a 2011 interview with the bbc friedman says that he wants his children to live in a world where '' there 's a strong america counterbalancing a strong and thriving china , and not one where you have a strong and rising china and an america that is uncertain , weak and unable to project power economically and militarily it historically did a translated version of his article from the new york times , '' china needs its own dream '' , has been credited with popularizing the phrase '' chinese dream '' in china , a term that was later adopted as a slogan by xi jinping walter russell mead described his prose as being '' an occasionally flat midwestern demotic punctuated by gee-whiz exclamations about just how doggone irresistible globalization is – lacks the steely elegance of a lippmann , the unobtrusive serviceability of a scotty reston or the restless fireworks of a maureen dowd and is best taken in small doses '' similarly , journalist matt taibbi has said of friedman 's writing that , '' friedman came up with lines so hilarious you could n't make them up even if you were trying – and when you tried to actually picture the 'illustrative ' figures of speech he offered to explain himself , what you often ended up with was pure physical comedy of the buster keaton/three stooges school , with whole nations and peoples slipping and falling on the misplaced banana peels of his literary endeavors '' in a column for the new york press , alexander cockburn wrote : '' friedman exhibits on a weekly basis one of the severest cases known to science of lippmann 's condition , named for the legendary journalistic hot-air salesman , walter lippmann , and alluding to the inherent tendency of all pundits to swell in self-importance to zeppelin-like dimensions '' i mean it as a clinical diagnosis of an almost-illiterate man who has been cheated out of a proper undergraduate education , sold as a liberal zionist to the highest bidder , and thus has managed to ramble and blabber his way up as a top-notch new york times columnist '' in april 2018 , barrett brown criticized friedman for '' his serial habit of giving the benefit of the doubt to whoever happens to hold power '' , such as friedman 's column supporting vladimir putin as a modernizing reformer , in which he urged americans to '' keep rootin ' for putin '' in the other side of outsourcing ( 2004 ) , he visited a call centre in bangalore , interviewing the young indians working there , and then travelled to an impoverished rural part of india , where he debated the pros and cons of globalization with locals ( this trip spawned his later book the world is flat ) in green : the new red , white and blue ( 2007 ) , friedman elaborates on the green technologies and efforts touched on in addicted to oil and in doing so , attempts to redefine green energy as geostrategic , geoeconomic , capitalistic and patriotic from beirut to jerusalem ( 1989 ;
