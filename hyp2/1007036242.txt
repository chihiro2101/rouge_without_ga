ratification of the plenipotentiaries on 18 september lloyd george recalled that : on 29 september lloyd george reiterated to de valera that recognition of the irish republic was '' a recognition which no british government can accord '' , and he repeated his invitation for talks on '' ascertaining how the association of ireland with the community of nations known as the british empire may best be reconciled with irish national aspirations '' , to start in london on 11 october , which was tacitly accepted by the irish side on 15 december , robert barton was questioned by kevin o'higgins about his notes on lloyd george 's statement about signing the agreement or facing a renewal of war : '' did mr lloyd george single mr barton out as the left wing of the delegation and did he say , 'the man who is against peace may bear now and forever the responsibility for terrible and immediate war ? ' '' barton replied : '' what he did say was that the signature and the recommendation of every member of the delegation was necessary , or war would follow immediately and that the responsibility for that war must rest directly upon those who refused to sign the treaty '' opening the debate on 14 december , president de valera stated his view on procedure : however , when the treaty was ratified by the dáil on 7 january , he refused to accept the vote as final , saying on 10 january that : secret sessions were held on 14 to 17 december , and on the morning of 6 january , to keep the discord out of the press and the public arena 156 , official correspondence relating to the peace negotiations june–september 1921 ( dublin , 1921 ) online version on 7 october de valera signed a letter of accreditation as '' president '' on behalf of the '' government of the republic of ireland '' ( see image ) , but the letter was never requested by the british side '' by 6 january , the day before the final vote , de valera acknowledged the deep division within his cabinet : '' when these articles of agreement were signed , the body in which the executive authority of this assembly , and of the state , is vested became as completely split as it was possible for it to become griffith , as president of the dáil , worked with michael collins , who chaired the new provisional government of the irish free state , theoretically answerable to the house of commons of southern ireland , as the treaty laid down the treaty 's provisions relating to the monarch , the governor-general , and the treaty 's own superiority in law were all deleted from the constitution of the irish free state in 1932 , following the enactment of the statute of westminster by the british parliament during the first of these , de valera also produced his ideal redraft , which was not in most respects radically different from the signed agreement , but which was probably not acceptable to the british side as the differing points had already been explored under the terms of the treaty , it required approval by : the parliament of the united kingdom , and a '' meeting summoned for the purpose of approving the treaty of the members elected to sit in the house of commons of southern ireland '' when they returned , collins and griffith hammered out the final details of the treaty , which included british concessions on the wording of the oath and the defence and trade clauses , along with the addition of a boundary commission to the treaty and a clause upholding irish unity healy wrote to his brother on 11 december 1919 : '' lloyd george said that , if he could get support for a plan whereby the six counties would be left as they are , he would be ready to give the rest of the country dominion home rule , free from imperial taxation , and with control of the customs and excise this was the nearest that the house of commons of southern ireland ever came to functioning ; no other meeting ever took place , but the vote on 14 january , in strict compliance with the treaty wording , allowed the british authorities to maintain that the legal niceties had been observed in fact , what ireland received in dominion status , on par with that enjoyed by canada , new zealand and australia , was far more than the home rule act 1914 , and certainly a considerable advance on the home rule once offered to charles stewart parnell in the nineteenth century albeit at the cost of the exclusion of northern ireland the contents of the treaty divided the irish republic 's leadership , with the president of the republic , éamon de valera , leading the anti-treaty minority , '' the path to freedom notes by general michael collins '' , august 1922 ; collins did not state that the remark was made solely to barton , implying that the whole irish delegation had heard it : '' the threat of 'immediate and terrible war ' did not matter overmuch to me although the british government of the day had , since 1914 , desired home rule for the whole of ireland , the british parliament believed that it could not possibly grant complete independence to all of ireland in 1921 without provoking huge sectarian violence between overwhelmingly protestant irish unionists and overwhelmingly catholic irish nationalists in the meantime , de valera had been elevated to president of the republic on 26 august , primarily to be able to accredit plenipotentiaries for the negotiations , as is usual between sovereign states arthur griffith ; comment on the delegates ' credentials both the irish and british sides knew that , in the event of failure , the truce agreed in july 1921 would end and the war would inevitably resume , a war that neither side wanted two of the other members of the delegation , robert barton and erskine childers , sided against the treaty in the civil war the pro-treaty side was to argue that after 11 october the negotiations had been conducted on the understanding that , even though the british were not negotiating with a sovereign state , the agreement was a significant first step towards irish sovereignty this was seized upon by opponents of the treaty as a convenient proof that the irish delegates had been subjected to duress at the last minute , and '' terrible and immediate war '' became a catch-phrase in the debates that followed of the 128 members elected , the 124 sinn féin candidates refused to sit in the house , instead forming ( along with some of the northern representatives ) an alternative parliamentary assembly , the second dáil , which claimed to represent all of ireland even de valera 's proposals made in secret during the treaty debates differed very little in essential matters from the accepted text , and were far short of the autonomous 32-county republic that he publicly claimed to pursue plenipotentiaries usually have full powers to handle negotiations as they see fit , but de valera had given them instructions to refer back to his cabinet on any '' main question '' and with '' the complete text of the draft treaty about to be signed '' , which created difficulties
