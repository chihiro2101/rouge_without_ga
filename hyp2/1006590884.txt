not long after v-e day , the investigations of the fedden mission into german aircraft engine development during the war years would reveal that the bmw firm had needed to undertake different levels of development priority for not only the fourteen-cylinder production 801 radial , but also the eighteen-cylinder bmw 802 ( with a displacement figure close to that of the wright r-3350 ) and liquid-cooled , wasp major-class ( though larger , at an 83.5 litre displacement ) bmw 803 radial engines instead , continued improvements to the basic e model led to the bmw 801f , which dramatically improved performance across the board , with takeoff power increasing to 2,400 & nbsp ; hp ( 1,790 & nbsp ; kw ) , making the 801 the only german aviation engine of an existing type that had a producible subtype that could luftwaffe engine development to be developed from an already combat-reliable , well-proven military aircraft powerplant by contrast , the two closest allied equivalents to the 801 in configuration and displacement – the american wright twin cyclone , and the soviet shvetsov ash-82 radials – never had any need to be developed beyond a 1,500 & nbsp ; kw output level as the 801 needed to be ; as larger-displacement , 18-cylinder radial aviation engines in both allied nations ( the american 46 litre double wasp and aforementioned , nearly 55 litre duplex-cyclone ) and the eventual 1945 premiere of the soviet 58 litre shvetsov ash-73 design , all three of which started their development before 1940 , handled needs for even greater power from larger-displacement allied radial aviation engines bruno bruckmann , head of bmw 's piston and jet engine development departments , and learned that the priorities for the trio of aforementioned bmw radial engines was : firstly , the 801 was to be developed '' up to its limits '' , with the 802 's design completion and prototype construction as a secondary issue , with the complex 803 four-row radial only receiving attention to its design-development the bmw 139 was originally intended to be used in roles similar to those of the other german radials , namely bombers and transport aircraft , but midway through the program the focke-wulf firm 's chief designer , kurt tank suggested it for use in the focke-wulf fw 190 fighter project this factory-supplied cowling also improved the simplicity of engine replacement in the field in more completely '' unitizing '' a bmw 801 radial engine , with as many of its auxiliary systems as possible being simultaneously replaceable with the engine itself , as opposed to opening or removing a '' separate '' cowling attached to the fuselage of the aircraft the e model was also used as the basis for the bmw 801r , which included a much more complex and powerful two-stage four-speed supercharger , as well as die cast hydronalium cylinder heads , strengthened crankshaft and pistons , and chromed cylinders and exhaust valves ; it was anticipated this version would produce over , or over with mw 50 methanol-water injection airflow past the gap between the cowl and outer lip of the metal ring produced a vacuum effect that pulled air from the front of the engine outward and forward within the cowl 's frontmost inner area just behind the fan , flowing forward across the oil cooler core in a separate airflow path from the rearwards-direction flow that cooled the engine 's cylinders , just to provide cooling for the 801 's oil the m and t unitized engine formats added secondary designator suffixes , which especially for the 801 radial ( and perhaps others ) , did not always match the letter suffix that designated the bare radial engine used for a particular unitized installation , confusing the naming of the 801 engine series ' subtypes considerably one key advancement for the 801 was the aforementioned kommandogerät ( command-device ) , a mechanical-hydraulic unit that automatically adjusted engine fuel flow , propeller pitch , supercharger setting , mixture and ignition timing in response to a single throttle lever , dramatically simplifying engine control sheffield p.169 air from the fan was blown into the center of the engine in front of the propeller gearing housing , and the shape of the housing and the engine itself carried the air to the outside of the cowling and across the cylinders the first used a modified bmw 801d to create the bmw 801j , 801j engine photo at flightglobal ( accessed march 11 , 2016 ) delivering 1,810 ps ( 1,785 & nbsp ; hp , 1,331 & nbsp ; kw ) at takeoff and 1,500 & nbsp ; hp ( 1,103 & nbsp ; kw ) at , an altitude where the d was struggling to produce 630 & nbsp ; hp ( 463 & nbsp ; kw ) it is rather common to see the turbocharged versions referred to only with the t for the more completely unitized triebwerksanlage installations , notably the ( most notoriously of all ) tj for the bmw 801j turbocharged radial subtype , and the tq models , further confusing the issue the more comprehensive triebwerksanlage format for unitization consolidated more of the engine 's required accessory systems beyond what the earlier motoranlage concept could , plus some external mountings , such as an integrally complete exhaust system ( including a turbocharger , if fitted as part of the design ) , as a completely interchangeable unit ; bmw 801 a , c , l ( b ) :1,560 ps ( 1,539 hp , 1,147 kw ) ; bmw 801 d-2 , q-2 , g-2 , ( h-2 ) :1,700 ps ( 1,677 hp , 1,250 kw ) ; bmw 801 e , s :2,000 ps ( 1,973 hp , 1,471 kw ) ; bmw 801 f :2,400 ps ( 2,367 hp , 1,765 kw ) , development halted by the end of the war there was a considerable amount of wind tunnel work done on the engine and bmw-designed forward cowling ( incorporating the engine 's oil cooler ) at the luftfahrtforschungsanstalt ( lfa ) facility in völkenrode , leading to the conclusion it was possible to reduce drag equivalent to comprising the bmw-designed forward cowl , in front of the oil cooler was a ring of metal with a c-shaped cross-section , with the outer lip lying just outside the rim of the cowl , and the inner side on the inside of the oil cooler core the bmw 801e was likewise modified to create the bmw 801q , delivering a superb 1,715 & nbsp ; hp ( 1,261 & nbsp ; kw ) at , power ratings no existing allied radial engine of a similar displacement could match the turbocharger was fitted behind the engine at a 30° forward tilt off a vertical axis , possessed hollow turbine blades in the exhaust section , and in a photo from flight magazine , appears to have intercooler units fitted around the inner circumference of the rear cowl , just behind the rear row of cylinders as just one result of the highest level of priority given to the successful 801 design 's further development , a number of attempts were made to use turbochargers on the bmw 801 series as well the 801c was replaced with the bmw 801 d-2 series engines in early 1942 , which ran on c2/c3 100 octane fuel instead of the a/b/c/l 's b4 87 octane , boosting takeoff power to 1,700 ps ( 1,677 & nbsp ; hp , 1,250 & nbsp ; kw )
