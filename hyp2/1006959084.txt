the regulation of the forces act 1871 regulation of the forces act 1871 ( 1871 c.86 ) section 6 removed the lieutenant as head of the county militia , as the jurisdiction , duties and command exercised by the lieutenant were revested in the crown , but the power of recommending for first appointments was reserved to the lieutenant the text of the letters patent appointing lieutenants under the act stated they were to be : this was a formal recognition of the situation that had existed since 1662 that the lieutenancies for the majority of counties corporate in england were held jointly with their associated county—for example a lieutenant was now appointed for '' the county of gloucester , and the city and county of gloucester , and the city and county of city of bristol '' for example , lieutenants of devon in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries appointed deputy lieutenants to the city of exeter , and were sometimes described as the '' lieutenant of devon and exeter '' the one exception was haverfordwest , to which a lieutenant continued to be appointed until 1974 in the case of towns or cities which were county corporate , the '' chief magistrate '' ( meaning the mayor , chief bailiff or other head of the corporation ) had the authority to appoint deputy lieutenants in the absence of an appointment of a lieutenant by the crown the office of lieutenant was abolished under the commonwealth , but was re-established following the restoration under the city of london militia act 1662 , which declared that : although not explicitly stated , from that date lieutenants were appointed to '' counties at large '' , with their jurisdiction including the counties corporate within the parent county the official title of the office at this time was his or her majesty 's '' lieutenant for the county of x '' , but , as almost all office-holders were peers of the realm , they were referred to as '' lord-lieutenant '' in the netherlands , king 's commissioners ( commissaris van de koning in dutch ) are appointed by the monarch , but unlike a lord-lieutenant , belong to a political party however , it was not until the threat of invasion by the forces of spain in 1585 that lieutenants were appointed to all counties and county corporate and became in effect permanent each lieutenant raised and was responsible for the efficiency of the local militia units of his county , and afterwards of the yeomanry and volunteers although colin , earl of balcarres was appointed lord lieutenant of fife in 1688 , and lieutenants were appointed to a few counties from about 1715 , it was not until 1794 that permanent lieutenancies were established by warrant ( law ) the militia act 1802 militia act 1802 ( 1802 c.90 ) provided for the appointment of lieutenants to '' lieutenants for the counties , ridings , and places '' in england and wales , and gave them command of the county militia it is their foremost duty to uphold the dignity of the crown , and in so doing they seek to promote a spirit of co-operation and good atmosphere through the time they give to voluntary and benevolent organisations and through the interest they take in the business and social life of their counties the uniform for a male vice lord-lieutenant and for deputy lieutenants is of a similar style , but with features to distinguish it from that of a lord-lieutenant : on shoulder boards no crown above the national symbol ( rose , shamrocks or thistle ) , no silver but blue cord on red collar patches ( deputy lieutenant simple grey stripe ) and only a single row of gold braid around the peak of the cap ( deputy lieutenant no oak leaf but simple gold tape ) in france and italy , the role of prefect ( préfet in french , prefetto in italian ) is different from that of lord-lieutenant , as the regional and departmental prefects of france are responsible for delivering as well as control functions of public services image : lord lieutenancies.png thumb right the lieutenancy areas of the united kingdom as of 2012 in 1996 scottish regions and districts were abolished on further local government reorganisation , and since that date lord-lieutenants have been appointed to '' lieutenancy areas '' , in most places roughly equivalent to the historic scottish counties where this could not be done , the existing office-holder became a lieutenant of a county , junior to the lord-lieutenant in contrast to the legislation in england and wales , each county borough was to have its own lieutenant , and those county corporate not made county boroughs were abolished the custos rotulorum ( ireland ) act 1831 1 & 2 william iv c.17 an act to provide for the better order and government of ireland , by lieutenants for the several counties , counties of cities , and counties of towns therein ; short title assigned by short titles act 1896 cancelled the commissions of the governors , transferred the militia and county magistrate functions to the ( re- ) established office of lieutenant ( appointed by letters patent and styled '' lord lieutenant '' ) , and empowered the lord lieutenant of ireland to appoint deputy lieutenants varies depending on where the lieutenant 's county is situated : a rose is worn in england , shamrocks in northern ireland , a thistle in scotland and prince-of-wales feathers in wales the lord lieutenant of ireland was the head of the british administration in ireland until the foundation of the irish free state in 1922 the effect of this was to create a lieutenant for the county boroughs of belfast and londonderry , and to abolish those for the city of kilkenny , borough of drogheda and town of galway in the counties of ireland , the officer in charge of the county militia was called '' lieutenant '' until james ii and '' governor '' thereafter so the vice lord-lieutenant 's dress resembles the one of a former brigadier-general of the british army , a deputy lieutenant 's dress resembles a field officer
