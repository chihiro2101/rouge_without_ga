there are 4 main types of urinary incontinence : stress incontinence , also known as effort incontinence , is essentially due to incomplete closure of the urinary sphincter , due to problems in the sphincter itself or insufficient strength of the pelvic floor muscles supporting it in men , the condition is commonly associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia ( an enlarged prostate ) , which causes bladder outlet obstruction , a dysfunction of the detrusor muscle ( muscle of the bladder ) , eventually causing overactive bladder , and the associated incontinence stress incontinence in women is most commonly caused by loss of support of the urethra , which is usually a consequence of damage to pelvic floor as a result of pregnancy , childbirth , obesity , age , among others the bladder is made of two types of muscles : the detrusor , a muscular sac that stores urine and squeezes to empty , and the sphincter , a circular group of muscles at the bottom or neck of the bladder that automatically stay contracted to hold the urine in and automatically relax when the detrusor contracts to let the urine into the urethra age is a risk factor that increases both the severity and prevalence of ui polyuria ( excessive urine production ) of which , in turn , the most frequent causes are : uncontrolled diabetes mellitus , primary polydipsia ( excessive fluid drinking ) , central diabetes insipidus and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus urologic causes can be classified as either bladder dysfunction or urethral sphincter incompetence and may include overactive bladder , poor bladder compliance , urethral hypermobility , or intrinsic sphincter deficiency this incontinence is associated with sudden forceful contractions of the detrusor muscle ( bladder muscle ) , leading to an intense feeling of urination , and incontinence if the person does not reach the bathroom on time the physical examination looks for signs of medical conditions causing incontinence , such as tumors that block the urinary tract , stool impaction , and poor reflexes or sensations , which may be evidence of a nerve-related cause people are often asked to keep a diary for a day or more , up to a week , to record the pattern of voiding , noting times and the amounts of urine produced the methods include the 1-h pad test , measuring leakage volume ; using a voiding diary , counting the number of incontinence episodes ( leakage episodes ) per day ; and assessing of the strength of pelvic floor muscles , measuring the maximum vaginal squeeze pressure after menopause , estrogen production decreases and , in some women , urethral tissue will demonstrate atrophy , becoming weaker and thinner , possibly playing a role in the development of urinary incontinence ultrasound & nbsp ; – sound waves are used to visualize the kidneys and urinary bladder , assess the capacity of the bladder before voiding , and the remaining amount of urine after voiding urge urinary incontinence , is caused by uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle , a condition known as overactive bladder the child 's brain begins to get messages from the filling bladder and begins to send messages to the bladder to keep it from automatically emptying until the child decides it is the time and place to void cystoscopy & nbsp ; – a thin tube with a tiny camera is inserted in the urethra and used to see the inside of the urethra and bladder
