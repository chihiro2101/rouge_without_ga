spiritism is based on the five books of the spiritist codification written by french educator hypolite léon denizard rivail under the pseudonym allan kardec , in which he reported observations of phenomena at séances that he attributed to incorporeal intelligence ( spirits ) the basic doctrine of spiritism ( '' the codification '' ) is defined in five of allan kardec 's books : the spirits book—defines the guidelines of the doctrine , covering concepts such as god , spirit , universe , man , society , culture , morals and religion ; the mediums ' book—makes claims about the mechanics of the spiritual world , such as the processes involved in channeling spirits and techniques to be developed by mediums ; the gospel according to spiritism—comments on the gospels , highlighting passages that kardec believed represent the ethical fundamentals shared by all religious and philosophical systems ; heaven and hell—purports to provide interviews with spirits of deceased people intending to establish a correlation between the lives they led and their conditions in the beyond ; the genesis according to spiritism—attempts to reconcile religion and science , dealing with three major conflicts between the two : the origin of the universe ( and of life , as a consequence ) and the concepts of miracle and premonition '' a spirit is not an abstract , undefined being , only to be conceived of by our thought ; it is a real , circumscribed being , which , in certain cases , is appreciable by the senses of sight , hearing , and touch '' '' on its re-entrance into the spirit world , the soul again finds there all those whom it has known upon the earth , and all its former existences eventually come back to its memory , with the remembrance of all the good and of all the evil which it has done in them '' '' spirits exert an incessant action upon the moral world , and even upon the physical world ; they act both upon matter and upon thought , and constitute one of the powers of nature , the efficient cause of many classes of phenomena hitherto unexplained or misinterpreted the good spirits try to lead us into the right road , sustain us under the trials of life , and aid us to bear them with courage and resignation ; the bad ones tempt us to evil : it is a pleasure for them to see us fall , and to make us like themselves '' the moral teaching of the higher spirits may be summed up , like that of jesus , in the gospel maxim , 'do unto others as you would that others should do unto you ; ' that is to say , do good to all , and wrong no one kardec , allan , the gospel explained by the spiritist doctrine other individuals such as francis of assisi , paul the apostle , buddha and gandhi are also sometimes considered by the spiritists spiritist philosophical inquiry is concerned with the study of moral aspects in the context of an eternal life in spiritual evolution through reincarnation , a process believers hold as revealed by spirits kessinger publishing there is a god , defined as '' the supreme intelligence and primary cause of everything '' ; there are spirits , all of whom are created simple and ignorant , but owning the power to gradually perfect themselves ; the natural method of this perfection process is reincarnation , through which the spirit faces countless different situations , problems and obstacles , and needs to learn how to deal with them ; as part of nature , spirits can naturally communicate with living people , as well as interfere in their lives ; many planets in the universe are inhabited in contrast , they believe that mediums have these natural abilities highly developed , and are able to communicate with spirits and interact with them visually or audibly , or through writing ( known by kardecists as psychography or automatic writing ) these meetings are open to anyone ;
