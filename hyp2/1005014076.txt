the allies had been planning to capture sevastopol in a coup de main , but decided instead to sail to evpatoria , which a landing party captured on 13september prince alexander sergeyevich menshikov , commander of russian forces in the crimea , was taken by surprise the british landing took much longer to complete compared to the french , as the infantry was landed first , when the sea was calm , but by the time the british tried to get their cavalry ashore , the wind was up and the horses struggled in the heavy surf the egyptian forces sent to alma consisted of the 3rd brigade commanded by major general ( amirliwa ) suleiman pasha al arnauti , the 3rd brigade was made up of the 13th infantry regiment ( commanded by brigadier mustafa bek ) and 14th infantry regiment ( commanded by brigadier ali bek ) the british troops and cavalry took 5 days to disembark 70 despite the plans for a surprise attack on sevastopol being undermined by the delays , six days later on 19september , the army finally started to head south , with its fleets supporting them the french were on the right of the allied line near the shore , with the turks following them , and the british were on the left further inland as the light brigade prepared to charge the cossacks , lord raglan sent an order for it to retreat when a large russian infantry force was discovered in a dip in the terrain ahead 44 the next morning , the allied army marched down the valley to engage the russians , whose forces were on the other side of the river , on the alma heights at the alma , prince menshikov , commander-in-chief of russian forces in the crimea , decided to make his stand on the high ground south of the river although the russian army was numerically inferior to the combined franco-british force ( 35,000 russian troops as opposed to 60,000 anglo-french-egyptian troops ) , the heights they occupied were a natural defensive position , indeed , the last natural barrier to the allied armies on their approach to sevastopol furthermore , the russians had more than one hundred field guns on the heights they could employ with devastating effect from the elevated position ; however , none were on the cliffs facing the sea , which were considered too steep for the enemy to climb the allies bivouacked on the northern bank of the bulganak , next day marching the to the north bank of the alma , where the ground sloped gently down to the river the precipitous cliffs running along the southern bank of the river were high and continued inland from the river 's mouth for almost two mi ( 3 & nbsp ; km ) , where they met a less steep , but equally high hill known as telegraph hill across the river from the village of bourliouk by mid-morning , the allied army was assembling on the plain , the british on the left of the sevastopol road , the french and the turks on the right , stretching out towards the coast 82 according to the plan that the allies had agreed upon the day before , the two armies were to advance simultaneously on a broad front and try to turn the enemy 's flank on the left further inland at the final moment , raglan decided to delay the british advance until the french had broken through on the right ; the troops were ordered to lie on the ground , within range of the russian guns , in a position from which they could scramble to the river when the time was right they arrived just in time to meet the extra infantry and artillery that menshikov had transferred from the center in an attempt to organize the resistance and prevent the russian army from being outflanked on its left the russians had more guns28 to the french 12 , but the french guns were of larger caliber and longer range , and bosquet 's riflemen kept the russian gunners at a distance where only the heavier french guns could take effect george de lacy evans , 2nd division 's commander on his left , calling on the british to advance and take some pressure off the french raglan was still waiting for the french attack to succeed before committing british troops , and at first told evans not to take orders from the french , but under pressure from evans , he relented by now , the first division had finally crossed the river and the russians in the greater redoubt saw approaching them the guards ' brigade , with the grenadiers on the right , the scots guards in the center , and the coldstream on the left 64â€“65 the scots fusiliers , by then ahead of the rest of the division , started to move uphill immediately , repeating the light division 's mistake , which at that moment was running down from the redoubt , pursued by russian infantry the scots fusiliers were forced to retreat , stopping only when they reached the river ; they remained in the riverbank shelter for the rest of the battle , ignoring repeated orders to advance by 16:00 , the allies were converging on the russian positions from all directions , with the guards on the left overcoming the last russian reserves on the kurgan hill , codrington 's men and the other guards closing in on the great redoubt , and the 2nd division pushing up the sevastopol road the battle cost the french 1,600 casualties , the british 2,000 , the egyptians 503 , and the russians some 5,000 the necessity of collecting equipment scattered though the battlefield delayed the pursuit , and the lack of cavalry ruled out any possibility of an immediate chase of the russians the british gave the name alma to a small settlement in north otago and to a river in marlborough ( both in new zealand ) in the new brunswick , canada , the parish of alma was created surrounding the village of alma in 1856 , commemorating the then-recent battle of alma
