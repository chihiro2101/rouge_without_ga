the cold reader slowly offers a huge quantity of very general information , often to an entire audience ( some of which is very likely to be correct , near correct or at the very least , provocative or evocative to someone present ) , observes their subjects ' reactions ( especially their body language ) , and then narrows the scope , acknowledging particular people or concepts and refining the original statements according to those reactions to promote an emotional response in an episode of his trick of the mind series broadcast in march 2006 , derren brown showed how easily people can be influenced through cold reading techniques by repeating bertram forer 's famous demonstration of the personal validation fallacy , or forer effect the forer effect relies in part on the eagerness of people to fill in details and make connections between what is said and some aspect of their own lives , often searching their entire life 's history to find some connection , or reinterpreting statements in a number of different possible ways so as to make it apply to themselves the list includes : heart disease , pneumonia , diabetes , emphysema , cirrhosis of the liver , kidney failure , most types of cancer , and , for that matter , to any cause of death in which cardiac arrest precedes death , or damage to the brainstem responsible for cardiopulmonary function combining the techniques of cold reading with information obtained covertly ( also called '' hot reading '' ) can leave a strong impression that the reader knows or has access to a great deal of information about the subject '' a cold reader can choose from a variety of personality traits , think of its opposite , and then bind the two together in a phrase , vaguely linked by factors such as mood , time , or potential most people in this situation will be wearing or carrying an item of jewelry with some connection to the person they have lost , but if asked directly in the context of a psychic reading whether they have such an item , the client may be shocked and assume that the reader learned the information directly from the deceased loved one with such a phrase , a cold reader can '' cover all possibilities '' and appear to have made an accurate deduction in the mind of the subject , despite the fact that a rainbow ruse statement is vague and contradictory in general , while revelations seem to come from the reader , most of the facts and statements come from the subject , which are then refined and restated by the reader so as to reinforce the idea that the reader got something correct '' father-figure '' can refer to somebody 's father , grandfather , uncle , cousin , or any male relative who is also a parent or has served in a parental role to the person the subject will then reveal further information with their replies ( whether verbal or non-verbal ) and the cold reader can continue from there , pursuing promising lines of inquiry and quickly abandoning or avoiding unproductive ones former new age practitioner karla mclaren has spoken about developing a system of cold reading without realising , saying in a 2004 interview that '' i did n't understand that i had long used a form of cold reading in my own work ! i was never taught cold reading and i never intended to defraud anyone ; i simply picked up the technique through cultural osmosis before starting the actual reading , the reader will typically try to elicit cooperation from the subject , saying something such as , '' i often see images that are a bit unclear and which may sometimes mean more to you than to me ; if you help , we can together uncover new things about you '' one of the most crucial elements of a convincing cold reading is a subject eager to make connections or reinterpret vague statements in any way that will help the reader appear to make specific predictions or intuitions ) the broader the generality , the higher the chance it resonates with someone – basically , it ’ s a magic trick , and yet prominent , smart people are willing to cosign on psychics ’ abilities one of many examples of this was when henry , during a session with celebrity ross matthews , stated '' bambi , why am i connecting to bambi ? '' matthews stated that his father , who was a hunter , would not shoot deer because of the movie bambi in series 2 episode 13 '' the future job '' , dalton rand ( luke perry ) is a con artist who uses both hot reading ( information gathering ) and cold reading to convince an audience that he can communicate with the dead this attempt to be polite , she realized , actually invited the other person , as mclaren has said , to '' lean into the reading '' and give her more pertinent information because the majority of time during a reading is spent dwelling on the '' hits '' the reader obtains , while the time spent recognizing '' misses '' is minimized , the effect gives an impression that the cold reader knows far more about the subject than an ordinary stranger could lynne kelly , kari coleman , ian rowland , and derren brown have used these techniques at either private fortune-telling sessions or open forum '' talking with the dead '' sessions in the manner of those who claim to be genuine mediums james underdown from center for inquiry and independent investigations group said , '' in the context of a studio audience full of people , cold reading is not very impressive
