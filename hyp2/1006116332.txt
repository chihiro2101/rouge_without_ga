false vacuum ) described by a quantum gravity or '' theory of everything '' all matter and energy of the entire visible universe is contained in a hot , dense point ( gravitational singularity ) , a billionth the size of a nuclear particle gravity separates and begins operating on the universe—the remaining fundamental forces stabilize into the electronuclear force , also known as the grand unified force or grand unified theory ( gut ) , mediated by ( the hypothetical ) x and y bosons which allow early matter at this stage to fluctuate between baryon and lepton states 10 −33 seconds :
