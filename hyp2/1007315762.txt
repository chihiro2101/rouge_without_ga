according to the big bang theory , the very early universe was an extremely hot and dense state about age of the universe which rapidly expanded matter that remained following the initial expansion has since undergone gravitational collapse to create stars , galaxy and other astronomical objects , leaving behind a deep vacuum that forms what is now called outer space these observations indicate that the spatial geometry of the observable universe is '' flat '' , meaning that photons on parallel paths at one point remain parallel as they travel through space to the limit of the observable universe , except for local gravity the flat universe , combined with the measured mass density of the universe and the accelerating hubble 's law , indicates that space has a non-zero vacuum energy , which is called dark energy estimates put the average energy density of the present day universe at the equivalent of 5.9 protons per cubic meter , including dark energy , dark matter , and baryonic matter ( ordinary matter composed of atoms ) the density of the universe is clearly not uniform ; it ranges from relatively high density in galaxies—including very high density in structures within galaxies , such as planets , stars , and black holes—to conditions in vast voids that have much lower density , at least in terms of visible matter unlike matter and dark matter , dark energy seems not to be concentrated in galaxies : although dark energy may account for a majority of the mass-energy in the universe , dark energy 's influence is 5 order of magnitude smaller than the influence of gravity from matter and dark matter within the milky way the deep vacuum of intergalactic space is not devoid of matter , as it contains a few hydrogen atoms per cubic meter the low density of matter in outer space means that electromagnetic radiation can travel great distances without being scattered : the mean free path of a photon in intergalactic space is about 10 23 & nbsp ; km , or 10 & nbsp ; billion light years in spite of this , extinction , which is the absorption and scattering of photons by dust and gas , is an important factor in galactic and intergalactic astronomy the earth 's atmospheric pressure drops to about pa at of altitude , compared to 100,000 pa for the international union of pure and applied chemistry ( iupac ) definition of standard pressure the temperature of outer space is measured in terms of the kinetic activity of the gas , as it is on earth the radiation of outer space has a different temperature than the kinetic temperature of the gas , meaning that the gas and radiation are not in thermodynamic equilibrium all of the observable universe is filled with photons that were created during the big bang , which is known as the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) a conjecture is that just such a scenario occurred early in the history of the solar system , with potentially microorganism-bearing rocks being exchanged between venus , earth , and mars out in space , sudden exposure of an unprotected human to very low pressure , such as during a rapid decompression , can cause pulmonary barotrauma—a rupture of the lungs , due to the large pressure differential between inside and outside the chest exposure to high-energy , ionizing cosmic rays can result in fatigue , nausea , vomiting , as well as damage to the immune system and changes to the white blood cell count the energy of such particles is significantly diminished by the shielding provided by the walls of a spacecraft and can be further diminished by water containers and other barriers.the impact of the cosmic rays upon the shielding produces additional radiation that can affect the crew geospace extends from earth 's atmosphere to the outer reaches of earth 's magnetic field , whereupon it gives way to the solar wind of interplanetary space the variable space-weather conditions of geospace are affected by the behavior of the sun and the solar wind ; the subject of geospace is interlinked with heliophysics—the study of the sun and its impact on the planets of the solar system although it meets the definition of outer space , the atmospheric density within the first few hundred kilometers above the kármán line is still sufficient to produce significant drag on satellites the region outside earth 's atmosphere and extending out to just beyond the moon 's orbit , including the lagrange points , is sometimes referred to as cislunar space interplanetary space is defined by the solar wind , a continuous stream of charged particles emanating from the sun that creates a very tenuous atmosphere ( the heliosphere ) for billions of kilometers into space the volume of interplanetary space is a nearly total vacuum , with a mean free path of about one astronomical unit at the orbital distance of the earth this space is not completely empty , and is sparsely filled with cosmic rays , which include ionized atomic nuclei and various subatomic particles the local interstellar medium is a region of space within 100 & nbsp ; parsecs ( pc ) of the sun , which is of interest both for its proximity and for its interaction with the solar system this volume nearly coincides with a region of space known as the local bubble , which is characterized by a lack of dense , cold clouds it forms a cavity in the orion arm of the milky way galaxy , with dense molecular clouds lying along the borders , such as those in the constellations of ophiuchus and taurus ) this volume contains about 10 4 –10 5 stars and the local interstellar gas counterbalances the astrospheres that surround these stars , with the volume of each sphere varying depending on the local density of the interstellar medium studies of the large scale distribution of galaxies show that the universe has a foam-like structure , with galaxy groups and clusters lying along filaments that occupy about a tenth of the total space as gas falls into the intergalactic medium from the voids , it heats up to temperatures of 10 5 & nbsp ; k to 10 7 & nbsp ; k , which is high enough so that collisions between atoms have enough energy to cause the bound electrons to escape from the hydrogen nuclei ; this is why the igm is ionized ) computer simulations and observations indicate that up to half of the atomic matter in the universe might exist in this warm–hot , rarefied state when gas falls from the filamentary structures of the whim into the galaxy clusters at the intersections of the cosmic filaments , it can heat up even more , reaching temperatures of 10 8 & nbsp ; k and above in the so-called intracluster medium ( icm ) for a low earth orbit , this velocity is about ; by contrast , the fastest piloted airplane speed ever achieved ( excluding speeds achieved by deorbiting spacecraft ) was in 1967 by the north american x-15 the energy required to reach earth orbital velocity at an altitude of is about 36 & nbsp ; mj/kg , which is six times the energy needed merely to climb to the corresponding altitude the rate of orbital decay depends on the satellite 's cross-sectional area and mass , as well as variations in the air density of the upper atmosphere there are several standard boundary designations , namely : the fédération aéronautique internationale has established the kármán line at an altitude of as a working definition for the boundary between aeronautics and astronautics this is used because at an altitude of about , as theodore von kármán calculated , a vehicle would have to travel faster than orbital speed to derive sufficient aerodynamic lift from the atmosphere to support itself nasa 's space shuttle used 400,000 feet , as its re-entry altitude ( termed the entry interface ) , which roughly marks the boundary where atmospheric drag becomes noticeable , thus beginning the process of switching from steering with thrusters to maneuvering with aerodynamic control surfaces the boundary represents the midpoint of a gradual transition over tens of kilometers from the relatively gentle winds of the earth 's atmosphere to the more violent flows of charged particles in space , which can reach speeds well over it covers the legal use of outer space by nation states , and includes in its definition of outer space the moon and other celestial bodies the treaty states that outer space is free for all nation states to explore and is not subject to claims of national sovereignty , calling outer space the '' province of all mankind '' this status as a common heritage of mankind has been used , though not without opposition , to enforce the right to access and shared use of outer space for all nations equally , particularly non-spacefaring nations the treaty was passed by the united nations general assembly in 1963 and signed in 1967 by the ussr , the united states of america and the united kingdom of these , more than 50 have been concerning the international co-operation in the peaceful uses of outer space and preventing an arms race in space four additional space law treaties have been negotiated and drafted by the un 's committee on the peaceful uses of outer space still , there remains no legal prohibition against deploying conventional weapons in space , and anti-satellite weapons have been successfully tested by the us , ussr , china , and in 2019 , india based on this idea that a vacuum could not exist , in the west it was widely held for many centuries that space could not be empty in 1887 , the michelson–morley experiment tried to detect the earth 's motion through this medium by looking for changes in the speed of light depending on the direction of the planet 's motion it was replaced by albert einstein 's theory of special relativity , which holds that the speed of light in a vacuum is a fixed constant , independent of the observer 's motion or frame of reference but the scale of the universe remained unknown until the first successful measurement of the distance to a nearby star in 1838 by the german astronomer friedrich bessel american physicists ralph alpher and robert herman predicted 5 & nbsp ; k for the temperature of space in 1948 , based on the gradual decrease in background energy following the then-new big bang theory for most of human history , space was explored by observations made from the earth 's surface—initially with the unaided eye and then with the telescope this was followed by the first human spaceflight in 1961 , when yuri gagarin was sent into orbit on vostok 1 since that time , uncrewed spacecraft have successfully examined each of the solar system 's planets , as well their moons and many minor planets and comets an important factor in the total expense is the high cost of placing mass into earth orbit : – per kg , according to a 2006 estimate ( allowing for inflation since then )
