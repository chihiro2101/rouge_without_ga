if , for example , a pair of atomic nuclei are merged to very briefly form a nucleus with a charge greater than about 140 , ( that is , larger than about the inverse of the fine structure constant , which is a dimensionless quantity ) , the strength of the electric field will be such that it will be energetically favorable to create positron-electron pairs out of the vacuum or dirac sea , with the electron attracted to the nucleus to annihilate the positive charge the concept of virtual particles arises in the perturbation theory of quantum field theory , an approximation scheme in which interactions ( in essence , forces ) between actual particles are calculated in terms of exchanges of virtual particles by expressing the interaction in terms of the exchange of a virtual particle with four-momentum , where is given by the difference between the four-momenta of the particles entering and leaving the interaction vertex , both momentum and energy are conserved at the interaction vertices of the feynman diagram for this reason , virtual particles & ndash ; which exist only temporarily as they are exchanged between ordinary particles & ndash ; do not typically obey the mass-shell relation ; the longer a virtual particle exists , the more the energy and momentum approach the mass-shell relation electromagnetic radiation consists of real photons which may travel light years between the emitter and absorber , but ( coulombic ) electrostatic attraction and repulsion is a relatively short-range force that is a consequence of the exchange of virtual photons in formal terms , a particle is considered to be an eigenstate of the particle number operator a † a , where a is the particle annihilation operator and a † the particle creation operator ( sometimes collectively called ladder operators ) as a consequence of quantum mechanical uncertainty , any object or process that exists for a limited time or in a limited volume can not have a precisely defined energy or momentum in semiconductors , the roles of electrons , positrons and photons in field theory are replaced by electrons in the conduction band , holes in the valence band , and phonons or vibrations of the crystal lattice in the adjacent image , the solid lines correspond to actual particles ( of momentum p 1 and so on ) , while the dotted line corresponds to a virtual particle carrying momentum k
