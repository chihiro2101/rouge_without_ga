emunoth ve-deoth ( kitāb al-amānāt wa-al-iʿatiqādāt ) , the book of beliefs and opinions : this ( כתאב אלאמאנאת ואלאעתקאדאת judeo-arabic ) was the name of saadia 's first edition , later emended by saadia to אלמכ'תאר פי אלאמאנאת ואלאעתקאדאת ( hebrew : הנבחר באמונות ובדעות ) as described by kafih on pages 8-9 of his edition ( this work , first compiled in 933 ce , of which several revisions were made until its final redaction , is considered to be the first systematic attempt to synthesize the jewish tradition with philosophical teachings herzog college ben zuta , herzog college ( in hebrew ) in the year 928 , at the age of thirty-six ( variant : forty-six ) , david ben zakkai , the exilarch of babylonian jewry , petitioned saadia to assume the honorary title of gaon , where he was appointed that same year the gaon of the academy of sura at mata mehasya , a position which he held for 14 years , until his death saadia 's arabic translation of the torah is of importance for the history of civilization ; itself a product of the arabization of a large portion of judaism , it served for centuries as a potent factor in the impregnation of the jewish spirit with arabic culture , so that , in this respect , it may take its place beside the greek bible-translation of antiquity and the german translation of the pentateuch by moses mendelssohn the effect of these ideas expressed in his philosophical books are clearly reflected in saadia 's story of creation , especially when he comes to deal with the theological problems , such as in the verse of deuteronomy 4:24 : “ for the lord your god is a devouring fire , ” which constitutes an example of a verse that can not be understood in its plain context , but should rather be understood in such a way as not to contradict one 's definite knowledge that god does not change , nor can anything corporeal be associated with him abraham ibn ezra , in his own commentary of the pentateuch , wrote scathing remarks on saadia 's commentary , abraham ibn ezra 's commentary of the pentateuch , on genesis 2:11–12 and on exodus 28:30 , as well as in his critique on rsg 's identification of the bird , ʿozniah ( the steppe eagle ) , in leviticus 11:13 abraham firkovich , hebrew newspaper hamelitz - 1868 , issue 26–27 at 23 he composed a polemic against the followers of anan ben david , particularly solomon ben yeruham , thus beginning the activity which was to prove important in opposition to karaism , in defense of rabbinic judaism he wrote both in hebrew and in arabic a work , now known only from a few fragments , entitled '' sefer ha-galui '' ( arabic title , '' kitab al-ṭarid '' ) , in which he emphasized with great but justifiable pride the services which he had rendered , especially in his opposition to heresy joseph ( sa'id al-fayyumi ) , jewishencyclopedia.com ;

in hebrew it is often given as '' pitomi , '' derived from a contemporary identification of fayum with the biblical pithom ( an identification found in saadia 's own works ) his dictionary , primitive and merely practical as it was , became the foundation of hebrew lexicography ; and the name '' agron '' ( literally , '' collection '' ) , which he chose and doubtless created , was long used as a designation for hebrew lexicons , especially by the karaites 33:17 , improperly translated as '' unicorn '' in some english translations , is a word that is now used in modern hebrew to represent the '' oryx , '' although saadia understood the same word to mean '' rhinoceros '' , and writes there the judeo-arabic word אלכרכדאן for the creature here , too , he was the first ; his grammatical work , now lost , gave an inspiration to further studies , which attained their most brilliant and lasting results in spain , and he created in part the categories and rules along whose lines was developed the grammatical study of the hebrew language the foremost object of his work was the bible ; his importance is due primarily to his establishment of a new school of biblical exegesis characterized by a rational investigation of the contents of the bible and a scientific knowledge of the language of the holy text according to a statement made by abraham ibn daud and doubtless derived from saadia 's son dosa , saadia himself died in babylonia at sura in 942 , at the age of sixty , of '' black gall '' ( melancholia ) , repeated illnesses having undermined his health saadia was attacked by the exilarch and by his chief adherent , the young but learned aaron ibn sargado ( later gaon of pumbedita , 943-960 ) , in hebrew pamphlets , fragments of which show a hatred on the part of the exilarch and his partisans that did not shrink from scandal in his commentary on the '' sefer yetzirah '' , saadia sought to render lucid and intelligible the content of this esoteric work by the light of philosophy and scientific knowledge , especially by a system of hebrew phonology which he himself had founded saadia addressed a warning to him , and in babylon he placed his knowledge and pen at the disposal of the exilarch david ben zakkai and the scholars of the academy , adding his own letters to those sent by them to the communities of the diaspora ( 922 ) an anecdote is reported in sefer hasidim about saadia ben yosef '' the sage , '' in which he ends a dispute between a servant who claims to be the heir of his deceased master and the man 's true son and heir by having them both draw blood into separate vessels he was likewise one of the founders of comparative philology , not only through his brief '' book of seventy words , '' already mentioned , but especially through his explanation of the hebrew vocabulary by the arabic , particularly in the case of the favorite translation of biblical words by arabic terms having the same sound for example , in psalm 16:4 , saadia retracts from the aramaic ( translated ) : '' they will multiply their goddesses english translation '' goddesses '' follows the aramaic targum of psalm 16:4 , where the word צלמניהון is used for עצבות , the plural feminine form of עצבים ( images ; idols ) found in psalm 115:4 , psalm 135:15 , among other places in babylonia he wrote his '' sefer ha-mo'adim , '' or '' book of festivals , '' in which he refuted the assertions of ben meir regarding the calendar , and helped to avert from the jewish community the perils of schism in that particular year , this change would result in a two-day schism with the major jewish communities in babylonia : according to ben meir the first day of passover would be on a sunday , while according to the generally accepted rule it would be on tuesday saadia 's judeo-arabic translation of the pentateuch ( tafsir ) was copied by them in nearly all their handwritten codices , and they originally studied saadia 's major work of philosophy , beliefs and opinions , in its original judeo-arabic , although by the early 20th-century , only fragments had survived '' however , saadia assures his readers elsewhere that when he rendered translations for the twenty odd unclean fowl that are mentioned in the hebrew bible ( leviticus 11:13 & ndash ; 19 ; deuteronomy 14:12 & ndash ; 18 ) , his translation was based on an oral tradition received by him further , it set forth the bases of the commandments of reason and the characterization of the commandments of revelation ; in the case of the former the author appealed to philosophical speculation ; of the latter , naturally , to tradition saadia , in '' sefer ha-galui '' , stresses his jewish lineage , claiming to belong to the noble family of shelah , son of judah , and counting among his ancestors hanina ben dosa , the famous ascetic of the first century saadia 's objective here was to show the parallelism between the truths delivered to the people of israel by divine revelation , on the one side , and the necessary conclusions that can also be reached by way of rational observation , on the other '' '' kitab al-'ibbur , '' or '' book of the calendar , '' likewise apparently containing polemics against karaite jews ; '' sefer ha-mo'adim , '' or '' book of festivals , '' the hebrew polemic against ben meir which has been mentioned above '' tafsir al-sab'ina lafẓah , '' a list of seventy ( properly ninety ) hebrew ( and aramaic ) words which occur in the hebrew bible only once or very rarely , and which may be explained from traditional literature , especially from the neo-hebraisms of the mishnah later , one of saadia 's chief disputants was the karaite by the name of abu al-surri ben zuṭa , who is referred to by abraham ibn ezra , in his commentary on the pentateuch ( exo
