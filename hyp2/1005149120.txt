also , as a new feature , most figures include advanced '' automorph technology '' , which is designed to create quicker and easier conversion , which means moving one part of the vehicle or robot causes other parts to move , creating a final shift to battle mode ; this was successful because the transformation was more complex in the movie line than in any other transformers toy line hasbro would go on to buy the entire toy line from takara , giving them sole ownership of the transformers toy-line , branding rights , and copyrights , while in exchange , takara was given the rights to

mode ( usually the head or tail ) would transform the entire toy , and moving the part back would transform the toy back to beast mode the transformers toy line was created from toy molds mostly produced by japanese company takara in the toy lines car-robots ( diaclone ) and micro change ( microman ) hasbro europe still will not accept , however , that the range was released in the uk in 1984 , not even with evidence such as argos 1984 catalogues containing the range , the uk comic launching in september 1984 or even the 1984 transformers product catalogue produced by '' hasbro industries ( uk ) ltd , wokingham '' other items of note in the armada line : the armada line featured the first commercially available figure of unicron , who is a legendary character from generation 1 , and the main villain of the transformers : the movie the first transformers toys were created from two different transforming robot toy lines from takara , the car-robots and micro change , from the diaclone and microman series , respectively a fresh idea coupled with a tv series program with strong stories assured this series the success hasbro and takara needed , as this series was a giant hit in international markets as well as in takara 's home market , japan complaints with this line were numerous , including the lack of articulation of the figures ( the shells could only move their arms ) , the simple transformation of the robots within , and their increasing lack of resemblance to any sort of modern recognizable vehicle '' world 's smallest transformers '' transformers : go-bots (

mini-con '' , with official support from hasbro nordic , and was held by members of the ntfa - the nordic transfans association , for the first time on november 3–4 , 2007 the beast wars toy line was launched in the autumn of 1995 , and mainframe entertainment produced a computer-generated imagery , or cgi , animated series program to tie in with the new toy line the following transformers toy series were released in the united states and japan : the transformers ( 1984–1990 usa ) ( 1984–1993 , uk/canada ) ( 1985–1992 , japan ) - retroactively called '' generation one '' or '' g1 '' since then also of note in the cybertron line : primus , the creator of the transformers conceived by simon furman for the uk transformers comic , received action figure treatment in the cybertron line after several lines of toys produced by one company or the other , hasbro and takara united to produce what was purported to be a single , identical line of transformers for release worldwide hence in japan '' the transformers '' did not debut under that brand till 1985 , when the line was also rolled out to the majority of the rest of the world between takara and hasbro many have speculated that this change might have been what signaled the beginning of the end for the transformers , as part of the novelty of the first lines was the realistic vehicles that turned into robots as noted previously , megatron 's original alternate mode , or '' transformation identity '' , was a handgun with attachments , but in generation two , this was changed to a tank due to safety and security concerns also , there was a clamor for a return to the original idea of the transformers , that of their being protean robots with nearly humanlike artificial intelligences who transformed into vehicles or devices still , despite the complaints , the pretender line continued through all but the final year of generation one , with variations such as beast pretenders , monster pretenders , classic pretenders , mega pretenders and ultra pretenders , each with variations on the theme or increasing levels of complexity the line was released as '' the transformers '' in the united states , canada and the uk in 1984 ( one year after the gobots ) but takara was still marketing diaclone at least during 1984 the second ntfa convention with official support from hasbro nordic , now renamed '' nordcon '' ( to avoid copyright problems with the name '' mini-con '' ) was held in aalborg , denmark from 19 june to 20 june 2010 in 1986 the transformers animated movie had been released , and during the run of the movie , through a pamphlet that came with certain figures , you could order certain transformers through the mail , such as optimus prime among other toys the transformers ' fan base splintered into two groups as a direct result , with the one enjoying beast wars for what it was and the other refusing to accept it as official canon in the transformers mythology also of note , megatron 's toy was repainted and re-released ( retooled to allow 4 new altmodes ) under the name galvatron , beginning a tradition of repaints that would follow through with armada and subsequent toy lines other items of note in the energon line : energon contains perhaps the most homages to generation 1 transformers in any subsequent line , with toys featuring similarities to classic figures such as omega supreme , skids , wheeljack , galvatron and ravage this line was later revived and merged into the transformers : crossovers toy line , many more transformers included characters from star wars : the clone wars like ahsoka tano who transforms into her jedi starfighter , and captain rex who transforms into an at-te the exoskeleton is a '' self-regenerating metal '' in which the aliens are composed of ( stated in the film ) that is the equivalent of living skin that heals itself this is a new line which features robot versions of various marvel comics superheroes ( and later more of the star wars transformers figures once it merged with this line ) the companion anime series program was not originally conceived or produced as a continuation of the armada/energon storyline , and it was only later that it was retconned to be a continuation however most fans of transformers recognise that most if not all of the toys released from this line were of excellent quality ( with the optimus prime and ultra magnus figures gaining considerable praise ) , combining the ball-joint articulation with detailed , well painted alternate modes the combaticons that formed bruticus were the first of the decepticons to be introduced into the show along with scourge , who as a toy was a black repaint of g2 laser prime in tandem with this new endeavor , armada signaled a new continuity in its accompanying animated series and a new focus in both the show and the toys on mini-cons , a new faction of transformers images surfaced , on-line , of some toy prototypes , notably starscream and a new decepticon who was to be named blackout , along with packaged samples of movie preview '' protoform '' optimus prime and starscream toys the first line of the toy series is the mickey mouse transformer which was modeled after optimus prime with the same colors as its transformer counterpart and can transform into a cartoonish trailer truck like the original version this line was brought by hasbro to america as the robots in disguise series , and featured the autobots facing off against the predacons in the '' transformers '' film , the robots had more of an alien feel to them to fit the theme of an alien invasion originally , transformers : animated was to be called '' transformers : heroes '' , but its name was changed to avoid confusion with the transformers live-action film the box claims the cereal had '' more taste than meets the eye '' and also had the ability to '' transform ordinary milk into chocolate flavored milk '' the small robot 's body was large in proportion to his arms and legs which made the figure appear fat , earning it the nickname '' fatimus prime '' or '' obese-imus prime '' when even more powerful versions of the optimus primal toy ( such as optimal optimus ) were introduced , hasbro even invented a '' 10+ '' rating in an attempt to keep increasing the power levels the smaller toys in these sub-groups came with energon weapons that could be used by the larger autobots and decepticons , along with energon chips that could be fastened to the larger figures to enhance their power the issue became a divisive one , as detractors accused supporters of lacking respect for the franchise 's history , while supporters accused detractors of being '' stuck in the past '' , and not accepting change hasbro also wanted the '' mutant heads '' found on all of the deluxe sized first year toys as battle helmets , but mainframe scrapped the idea as it would have required three animation models for each character instead of two the line was later commemorated as a sub-series of the transformers : universe line , where it had the nickname of '' classics 2.0 '' hasbro acquired the rights to sell them in the united states but , instead of selling them under their original names , they were rebranded as '' the transformers '' the mini-cons often mimicked features associated with generation 1 sub-groups such as the headmasters and targetmasters , transforming into weapons and , in three cases , a transformer 's head a figure of donald duck based on both bumblebee and herbie , and a second repaint of the mickey mouse trailer in halloween colors , are also planned for release
