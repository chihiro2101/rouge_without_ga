divided into three teams : the a '' able '' ( contemporary spelling alphabet ) team consisted of the squad leader and two scouts , the support b '' baker '' team with the bar gunner , assistant gunner , and ammunition bearer , and c '' charlie '' team ( assistant squad leader , also serving as the anti-tank grenadier , and five riflemen , one of whom served as the alternate anti-tank grenadier ) the united states marine corps doctrine dictates that any active fireteam will include at least one 2-man machine gun and summarises its fireteam organisation with the mnemonic '' ready-team-fire-assist '' , the following being the arrangement of the fireteam when in a column : rifleman : acts as a scout for the fireteam ; '' ready the fireteam is generally used as a subdivision of the section for fire and manoeuvre rather than as a separate unit in its own right , although fireteams or fireteam-sized units are often used for reconnaissance tasks , special operations , and urban patrols ( usually being to referred to as a 'brick ' in the latter scenario ) headquarters , department of the army : attp 3-06.11 ( fm 3-06.11 ) – combined arms operations in urban terrain ( june 2011 ) headquarters , department of the army : fm 3-21.8 – the infantry rifle platoon and squad ( march 2007 ) team leader ( tl ) : usually either a sergeant or corporal ( although occasionally a team is led by a specialist or private first class when the platoon has a shortage of junior ncos ) meanwhile , the communist chinese established the three-man fireteam concept as the three-man cell when they organized a regular army , and its organization seemed to have been disseminated throughout all of asia 's communist forces , perhaps the most famous of which are the pavn/nva ( people 's army of vietnam/north vietnamese army ) and the viet cong in a stryker brigade combat team ( sbct ) 's infantry rifle companies , one man in each rifle squad fireteam is either the squad anti-armour specialist ( rmat ) armed with the fgm-148 javelin , or the designated marksman ( dm ) who carries the m4 carbine and m14 rifle in order to combat this stalemate , the germans developed a doctrinal innovation known as infiltration tactics ( based on the russian tactics used in the brusilov offensive ) , in which a brief intensive artillery preparation would be followed by small , autonomous teams of stormtroopers , who would covertly penetrate defensive lines navy construction force , '' seabee '' construction battalions , utilise fireteams ( as well as companies , platoons , and squads ) , similar in size to those employed by the usmc , in their organisational structure each fire team was composed of a 2-man bar automatic rifleman and assistant , a scout ( marksman/grenadier ) armed with a m1903 springfield with a rifle grenade discharger , and a team leader armed with an m1 carbine or m1 smg in an assault the a team would provide overwatch and security or assist the c team in the assault , as the squad leader directed , while the b team provided suppressive fire in combat , while attacking or manoeuvring , a fireteam generally spreads over a distance of , while in defensive positions the team can cover up to the range of its weapons or the limits of visibility , whichever is less under his command , the marine raiders were issued with the semi-automatic m1 garand rifle and were organised in the standard 4-man fireteam ( although it was called firegroup ) concept , 3 firegroups to a squad with a squad leader infantry units of the british army , royal marines and raf regiment introduced the fireteam concept following the adoption of the sa80 rifle and light support weapon earlier section organisations had one private per fireteam carrying an l86 light support weapon ( intended to replace the l7a2 ) and then an l110 light machine gun ; the l110a3 was removed from service in 2019 , with the earlier l7a2 being reinstated as the section machine gun the automatic rifleman is usually assigned with the team leader to maximize directed fields of fire and to help balance the firepower capabilities of the grenadier french chasseur units in wwi were organised into fireteams , equipped with a light machine gun ( chauchat ) team and grenades , to destroy german fire positions by fire ( not assault ) at up to 200 meters using rifle grenades many other armed forces see the squad as the smallest military unit ; some countries ' armies have a pair consisting of two soldiers as the smallest military unit a fireteam in turn consists of at least two fire and manoeuvre teams , and a squad of two or more fireteams two fireteams form an 'assault group ' which is analogous to most other militaries ' understanding of a fireteam ; two assault groups and a vehicle group of one driver and one gunner form a section of ten soldiers earlier fireteam organisations had one private per fireteam carrying either an l86a2 light support weapon or an l129a1 depending on availability ; the l86a2 was removed from service in 2019 , with the l129a1 officially becoming the standard section dmr a battle pair is the smallest unit above the individual soldier , in the modern era chiefly employed by baltic militaries and special forces like the special air service successful fireteam employment relies on quality small unit training for soldiers , experience of fireteam members operating together , sufficient communications infrastructure , and a quality non-commissioned officer corps to provide tactical leadership for the team '' designated automatic rifleman : uses the m249 light machine gun or m27 iar and serves as second in command for the fireteam ;
