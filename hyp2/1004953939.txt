thumb on 23 september 1885 , auer von welsbach received a patent on his development of the gas mantle , which he called auerlicht , using a chemical mixture of 60 % magnesium oxide , 20 % lanthanum oxide and 20 % yttrium oxide , which he called actinophor 1900 , elliott cresson medal , the franklin institute awards , philadelphia , pa , usa 1901 , raised to the hereditary nobility by franz joseph i of austria , with the title of freiherr von welsbach 1920 , werner von siemens ring 1921 , wilhelm exner medal , inaugural awardee , austrian industry association , austria 1988 , the welsbach museum at althofen was opened in april , 1998 2011 , national inventors hall of fame , north canton , ohio , usa in naming both elements , and not leaving the original name didymium to the more-abundant component , auer von welsbach diverged from established practice , which was to give a new name only to the less-abundant component in 1885 , auer von welsbach used a method of fractional crystallization that he had developed himself to separate the alloy didymium into its two parts , for the first time the rare earth element lutetium was independently discovered by three scientists at around the same time in 1907 : french scientist georges urbain , austrian auer von welsbach , and american charles james the metal-filament light bulb was a huge improvement on the existing carbon-filament designs , lasting much longer , using about half the electricity for the same amount of light , and being much more robust after 167 crystallizations , auer von welsbach differentiated it into two colored salts : he named the green colored salt '' praseodymium '' and the pink one '' neodidymium '' he then moved to the university of heidelberg in 1880 , where he continued his studies in spectroscopy under the direction of robert bunsen , ( inventor of the bunsen burner ) in 1890 he introduced a new form of the mantle based on a mixture of 99 % thorium dioxide and 1 % cerium ( iv ) oxide , which he developed in collaboration with his colleague ludwig haitinger although originally intended to be a new mantle , it was during this period that electricity was being introduced into the market , and he started experimenting with ways to use the filaments as a replacement for the electric arc lamp the sun shines in the middle of the green niobium pill , while several methods of illumination from the gas light from incandescent light bulbs and neon lamps to modern light-emitting diodes spread out around the silver ring in addition to his work on elements and minerals , he made advances in the development of photographic techniques in 1910 , one of his companies helped to establish vienna as a center of radiation research by producing the first major quantity of radium chloride ( 3-4 grams ) in europe in 1910 , auer von welsbach reported a '' mysterious observation '' , the induction of radioactivity in an inactive substance when exposed to a radioactive substance meyer and his staff do not appear to have had the chemical knowledge to understand auer von welsbach 's methods , and auer von welsbach resigned around 1917 in 2008 ( 150 years after his birth ) auer von welsbach was selected as a main motif for a high-value collectors ' coin : the austrian â‚¬25 fascination light
