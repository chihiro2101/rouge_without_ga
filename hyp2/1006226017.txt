if such detail is less important , perhaps because the analyst is more concerned with the overall gross structure of the conversation or the relative distribution of turns-at-talk amongst the participants , then a second type of transcription known as broad transcription may be sufficient ( williamson , 2009 ) for the former , the work is still very much done by a human transcriber who listens to a recording and types up what is heard in a computer , and this type of software is often a multimedia player with functionality such as playback or changing speed orthographic transcription , on the other hand , has a morphological and a lexical component alongside the phonetic component ( which aspect is represented to which degree depends on the language and orthography in question ) transcription in action - website from uc santa barbara documentation and examples for the hiat transcription system transcription - a website with resources for transcription in conversation analysis the first , called narrow transcription , captures the details of conversational interaction such as which particular words are stressed , which words are spoken with increased loudness , points at which the turns-at-talk overlap , how particular words are articulated , and so on arguably the first system of its kind , originally described in ( ehlich and rehbein 1976 ) â€“ see ( ehlich 1992 ) for an english reference - adapted for the use in computer readable corpora as ( rehbein et al over four decades , for the majority of which she held no university position and was unsalaried , jefferson 's research into talk-in-interaction has set the standard for what became known as conversation analysis ( ca ) spoken language , on the other hand , is a continuous ( as opposed to discrete ) phenomenon , made up of a potentially unlimited number of components phonetic transcription is doubtlessly more systematic in a scientific sense , but it is also harder to learn , more time-consuming to carry out and less widely applicable than orthographic transcription this system is employed universally by those working from the ca perspective and is regarded as having become a near-globalized set of instructions for transcription two types of transcription software can be used to assist the process of transcription : one that facilitates manual transcription and the other automated transcription systems for orthographic transcription , by contrast , consist of rules for mapping spoken words onto written forms as prescribed by the orthography of a given language examples for orthographic transcription systems ( all from the field of conversation analysis or related fields ) are : the jefferson transcription system is a set of symbols , developed by gail jefferson , which is used for transcribing talk for the latter , automated transcription is achieved by a speech recognition which converts audio or video files into electronic text having had some previous experience in transcribing when she was hired in 1963 as a clerk typist at the ucla department of public health to transcribe sensitivity-training sessions for prison guards , jefferson began transcribing some of the recordings that served as the materials out of which harvey sacks ' earliest lectures were developed the field of conversation analysis itself includes a number of distinct approaches to transcription and sets of transcription conventions 1992 ) , used for transcription of the santa barbara corpus of spoken american english ( sbcsae ) , later developed further into dt2 transcription systems are sets of rules which define how spoken language is to be represented in written symbols
