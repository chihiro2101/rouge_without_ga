similar to the display they had done the previous year , when the aircraft were painted black , it consisted of a night-time air display over the wembley exhibition flying raf sopwith snipes which were painted red for the display and fitted with white lights on the wings , tail , and fuselage after a demonstration in france , they were hailed as '' les fleches noires '' and from then on known as the black arrows in 1958 , the black arrows performed a loop and barrel roll of 22 hunters , a world record for the greatest number of aircraft looped in formation in 1964 , the red pelicans , flying six bac jet provost t mk 4s , assumed the role of the raf 's leading display team in 1964 , all the raf display teams were amalgamated , as it was feared pilots were spending too much time practising formation aerobatics rather than operational training the new team name took the word '' red '' from the fact that the red pelicans ' planes had been painted red ( for safety reasons , as it was a far clearer and more visible colour in the sky ) and '' arrows '' after the black arrows the royal air force aerobatic team , the formal name of the red arrows , began life at raf little rissington in gloucestershire , then the central flying school the red arrows moved to raf kemble , now cotswold airport , in 1966 after raf fairford became the place of choice for bac to run test flights for concorde as an economy measure , scampton closed in 1995 , so the red arrows moved just 20 miles to raf cranwell ; however , as they still used the air space above scampton , the emergency facilities and runways had to be maintained the first team , led by squadron leader lee jones , had seven display pilots and flew the folland gnat t1 jet trainer at the subsequent national air day display , three days later , at clermont ferrand in france , one french journalist described the team as '' les fleches rouges '' , confirming the name '' the red arrows '' by the end of their first season , the red arrows had displayed 65 times in britain , france , italy , holland , germany , and belgium and were awarded the britannia trophy by the royal aero club for their contribution to aviation in 1968 , the then team leader ( sqn ldr ray hanna ) expanded the team from seven to nine jets , as he wanted to expand the team 's capabilities and the permutations of formation patterns after displaying 1,292 times in the folland gnat , the red arrows took delivery of the bae hawk in 1979 since being introduced into service with the red arrows , the hawk has performed with the red arrows in 50 countries this was reiterated by prime minister david cameron on 20 february 2013 , when he guaranteed the estimated £9m per annum costs while visiting india to discuss a possible sale of hawk aircraft to be used by india 's military aerobatics team , the surya kiran the ministry of defence confirmed in june 2012 that the red arrows would remain at raf scampton until at least the end of the decade in july 2018 the raf announced that raf scampton scampton was the wartime base of 617 sqdn , known as the dambusters , which flew raids against german dams using british engineer barnes wallis ’ upkeep bouncing bomb during world war ii pilots must have completed one or more operational tours on a fast jet such as the tornado , harrier , or typhoon , have accumulated at least 1,500 flying hours , and have been assessed as above average in their operational role to be eligible the 'boss ' , as he is known to the rest of the team , is always a pilot who has previously completed a three-year tour with the red arrows , often ( although not always ) including a season as the leader of the synchro pair reds 1 to 5 are known as 'enid ' ( named after enid blyton , author of the famous five books ) and reds 6 to 9 are known as 'gypo ' ( the nickname of one of the team 's pilots back in the 1960s ) at the end of each season , one of that year 's new pilots will be chosen to be red 7 for the following season , with that year 's red 7 taking over as red 6 the reds have no reserve pilots , as spare pilots would not perform often enough to fly to the standard required , nor would they be able to learn the intricacies of each position in the formation the new pilots joining the team spend their first season flying at the front of the formation near the team leader during an aerobatics display , red arrows pilots experience forces up to five times g-force , and when performing the aerobatic manoeuvre 'vixen break ' , forces up to 7g can be reached , close to the 8g structural limit of the aircraft as well as the nine pilots , 'red 10 ' , who is the team supervisor , is a fully qualified hawk pilot who flies the tenth aircraft when the red arrows are away from base the engineering team that supports the red arrows is known as '' the blues '' and consists of 85 members drawn from various technical ( and support ) trades in the raf each member of the circus works with the same pilot for the duration of the season and is responsible for servicing their aircraft and preparing their flying kit prior to each display the team use the same two-seat training aircraft used for advanced pilot training , at first the folland gnat which was replaced in 1979 by the bae hawk the hawks are modified with an uprated engine and a modification to enable smoke to be generated ; diesel is mixed with a coloured dye and ejected into the jet exhaust to produce either red , white or blue smoke during displays , the aircraft do not fly directly over the crowd apart from entering the display area by flying over the crowd from behind ; any manoeuvres in front of and parallel to the audience can be as low as , the 'synchro pair ' can go as low as straight and level , or when in inverted flight by the end of the 2009 season , the red arrows had performed a total of 4,269 displays in 53 countries following the accidents during the 2011 season , the red arrows retained red 8 and moved the original red 10 to the red 5 position to enable them to continue displaying with nine aircraft in march 2012 , the mod announced that the red arrows would fly aerobatic displays with seven aircraft during the 2012 display season as flt lt kirsty stewart had moved into a ground-based role with the team it is believed this was due to the emotional stress she had been suffering over the loss of her two red arrows colleagues the previous year as a consequence of this , red 8 also dropped out of the display team to enable an odd number of aircraft to perform and thus maintain formation symmetry in 2014 , the red arrows celebrated 50 years of aerobatic history as a display team returning to raf fairford for the royal international air tattoo they performed flypasts or displays in karachi in pakistan ; hindon and hyderabad in india ; dhaka in bangladesh ; singapore ; kuala lumpur in malaysia ; danang in vietnam ; beijing , shanghai , wuhan , guangzhou , hong kong and zhuhai in china ; muscat in oman ; manama in bahrain ; abu dhabi and kuwait the programme was the first time the team had displayed in china , and the first time a british military aircraft had deployed to vietnam as the fuel capacity of the hawk sets a limit to nonstop flight distance , and the hawk is incapable of air-to-air refuelling , very long flights between display sites may need landings on the way to refuel for example , a flight from raf scampton to quebec for an international air display team competition had to be done in seven hops : raf scampton , raf kinloss ( scotland ) , keflavík ( iceland ) , kangerlussuaq ( west greenland ) , narsarsuaq ( south tip of greenland ) , goose bay ( newfoundland ) , bagotville , quebec for the same reason , red arrows displays in new zealand are unlikely because there is no land near enough for a hawk to land and refuel to reach new zealand on the most fuel that it can carry during this time it was still travelling at some speed and as the rear seat was a little higher and the canopy was broken , it made contact with the ground pulling the top handle of the seat and setting off the ejection sequence , but as you say the seat could not go anywhere and so the seat rails came out through the bottom of the floor sadly i witnessed this crash from start to finish , with many others , as it was a families day for the red arrows and many people were there to watch the practise ” the accident was due to asymmetric fuelling of the aircraft – when one side ran out of fuel the flow proportioner , which equalised usage from both sides , cut the fuel flow off from the other side , causing embarrassment ) ; : hawk xx297 flown by flt lt dan findlay flew into the jet wash of the leading aircraft during a practice display at raf scampton and was unable to relight the hawk 's engine
