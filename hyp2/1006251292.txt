imitation plays a large role in children 's lives ; in order to pick up skills and techniques that they use in their own life , children are always searching for behaviors and attitudes around them that they can co-opt in other words , children get influenced by people that are important in their lives such as friends , parents and even youtubers , celebrities , singers , dancers , etc similar to the asch conformity experiments , a study done on groups of preschool children showed that they were influenced by groups of their peers to change their opinion to a demonstrably wrong one each child was handed a book with two sets of images on each page , with a groups of differently sized animals on the left hand page and one animal on the right hand , and each child was asked to indicate the size of the lone animal however , when allowed to privately share their responses with a researcher the children proved much more resistant to their peers ' pressure , illustrating the importance of the physical presence of their peers in shaping their opinions the results were clear-cut , showing that the monitored students ' disruption dropped when teachers started the points system and monitored them , but when peer monitors were introduced the target students ' disruption dropped to average rates of 1 % for student c1 , 8 % for student c2 , and 11 % for student c3 ( down from 36 % , 62 % , and 59 % , respectively ) even small children , then , are susceptible to pressure from their peers , and that pressure can be used to effect positive change in academic and social environments adolescence is the time when a person is most susceptible to peer pressure because peers become an important influence on behavior during adolescence , and peer pressure has been called a hallmark of adolescent experience peer pressure can also have positive effects when youth are pressured by their peers toward positive behavior , such as volunteering for charity or excelling in academics even though socially accepted children often have the most opportunities and the most positive experiences , research shows that social acceptance ( being in the popular crowd ) may increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behavior , depending on the norms in the group gender also has a clear effect on the amount of peer pressure an adolescent experiences : girls report significantly higher pressures to conform to their groups in the form of clothing choices or speech patterns for example , parental monitoring is negatively associated with substance use ; yet when there is little monitoring , adolescents are more likely to succumb to peer coercion during initiation to substance use , but not during the transition from experimental to regular use also available as : caldwell and colleagues extended this work by finding that peer pressure was a factor leading to heightened risk in the context of social gatherings with little parental monitoring , and if the individual reported themselves as vulnerable to peer pressure allen and colleagues showed that susceptibility to peer pressure in 13- and 14-year-olds was predictive of not only future response to peer pressure , but also a wider array of functioning for instance , in a study of nicotine use johnson and colleagues found that peer smoking had a lower effect on nicotine dependence for those with the high risk allele ( chrna5 ) this suggests that social contexts do not play the significant role in substance use initiation and maintenance as it may for others and that interventions for these individuals should be developed with genetics in mind as well using the resistance to peer influence scale , sumter and colleagues found that resistance to peer pressure grew as age increased in a large study of 10- to 18-year-old a study in los angeles and orange counties that established conservative norms and attempted to correct children 's beliefs about substance abuse among their peers showed a statistically significant decrease in alcohol , tobacco , and marijuana use but other studies that systematically reviewed school-based attempts to prevent alcohol misuse in children found '' no easily discernible pattern '' in both successful and failed programs when administered the training in several short sessions that taught the children how to recognize risk from peers and react accordingly , the children showed through post-training assessments that they were able to identify potential threats and sources of pressure from peers and deflect them far better than normal adolescents in a control group they found a number of unhealthy practices derived from peer pressure : condoms are derided , threats of ridicule for abstinence , and engaging in sexual activity with multiple partners as part of a status symbol ( especially for males ) descriptive norms and injunctive norms are both observed behaviors and are thus more indirect forms of pressure , but differ in one key aspect : descriptive norms describe peers ' sexual behaviors , but injunctive norms describe peers ' attitudes toward those behaviors ( e.g the last norm defined by the study is called '' peer pressure '' by the authors , and is used to describe direct encouragement or pressure by a person 's peers to engage in sexual behavior the review found that indirect norms ( descriptive and injunctive ) had a stronger effect on a person 's decision to engage in sexual behavior than direct peer pressure the mpfc is active when determining '' socially tagged '' objects , which are objects that peers have expressed an opinion about ; the striatum is significant for determining the value of these '' socially tagged '' objects and rewards in general before the actual experiment began , the subjects were subject to a phase of '' social '' influence , where they learned which symbols were preferred by other subjects of completed the experiment ( while in actuality these other subjects did not exist ) researchers conducted an experiment with adolescent males who were of driving age and measured their risk-taking depending on whether a passenger ( a peer of the same age ) was in the car one side of the reward system is '' social pain '' , which refers to the emotional pain felt by individual due to group repudiation and is associated with heightened activity in the anterior insula and the posterior cingulate a explanation of how the peer pressure process works , called “ the identity shift effect , ” is introduced by social psychologist , wendy treynor , who weaves together festinger ’ s two seminal social-psychological theories ( on dissonance , which addresses internal conflict , and social comparison , which addresses external conflict ) into a unified whole according to treynor ’ s original “ identity shift effect ” hypothesis , the peer pressure process works in the following way : one ’ s state of harmony is disrupted when faced with the threat of external conflict ( social rejection ) for failing to conform to a group standard to rid oneself of this internal conflict ( self-rejection ) , an “ identity shift ” is undertaken , where one adopts the group ’ s standards as one ’ s own , thereby eliminating internal conflict ( in addition to the formerly eliminated external conflict ) , returning one to a state of harmony although the peer pressure process begins and ends with one in a ( conflict-less ) state of harmony , as a result of conflict and the conflict resolution process , one leaves with a new identity—a new set of internalized standards actions and influence on social media may lead to changes in identity , confidence , or habits in real life for children , adolescents , and adults over 3 billion social media users across the world are using a variety of platforms , in turn , the type , frequency , and scope of the resulting peer pressure fluctuates for the officers , no official sanction was given , but it was well known that being unable to carry out executions was the sign of a '' weak '' leader , and the officer would be passed for promotions some superior officers treated those who did not want to execute jews with disdain ; on the other hand , those selected for the executions or jewish hunts were regarded as real '' men '' and were verbally praised accordingly for some , refusing their tasks meant that their compatriots would need to carry the burden and the guilt of abandoning their comrades ( as well as fear of ostracization ) compelled them to kill taking photos of the deceased , going on '' jew-hunts '' , death marches near the end of the war , and a general focus on hate ( rather than ignorance ) are points goldhagen utilizes in his book as he notes , '' for that matter , for someone to be pressured into doing something , by peer pressure , everyone else has to want to do it he points to the massacres of non-jews as an example : '' goldhagen does not shine light on the motives of “ hitler ’ s willing executioners ” in murdering handicapped people within the so-called “ euthanasia program ” , in liquidating 2.7 million soviet prisoners of war , in exterminating romas or in killing hundreds of thousands of other people classified as enemies of the “ german people and nation ” the emphasis on german responsibility allows goldhagen to push aside the willingness of genocidal killers of other nationalities such as latvians who , recruited from the vast army of indigenous collaborators , were often commissioned with the task of carrying out the ‘ dirty work ’ , such as the murder of women and children , and who , in many cases , surpassed their german masters in their cruelty and spontaneous brutality '' for example , starting at a set point such as the home of a '' mobilizing '' agent for the hutu ( any individual who planned or led an attack in the village ) , the proportion of convicts living in a 100m radius of a resident is almost twice as many for convicts ( individuals convicted of genocide by the gacaca , a local institution of transitional justice that allows villagers to adjudicate on many of the perpetrators ’ crimes by themselves ) as for non-convicts the extreme control of citizens ' daily lives by the government in social affairs facilitated the rapidity of the genocide 's spread and broke down the resolve of some who initially wanted to have no part in the genocide gerber , green , and larimer conducted a large-scale field experiment involving over 180,000 michigan households in 2006 and four treatments : one was a reminder to vote , one was a reminder to vote and a note informing them that they were being studied , one that listed the voting records for all potential household individuals , and finally one that listed the voting records for the household individuals and their neighbors the final treatment emphasized peer pressure within a neighborhood ; neighbors could view each other 's voting habits with the lists , and so the social norm of '' voting is best for the community '' is combined with the fear that individuals ' peers would judge their lack of voting compared to a baseline rate of 29.7 % ( only the voting reminder ) , the treatment that utilized peer pressure increased the percentage of household voters by 8.1 % ( to 37.8 % ) , which exceeds the value of in-person canvassing and personalized phone calls this leads to a dilemma : charities will do better by approaching groups of people ( such as friends ) ; however , this could result in increased donor discomfort , which would impact their future donations organizational researchers have found a generally similar phenomenon among large corporations : executives and managers of large companies look to similar organizations in their industry or headquarters city to figure out the appropriate level of corporate charitable donations , and those that make smaller donations might be seen as stingy and suffer damage to their reputations
