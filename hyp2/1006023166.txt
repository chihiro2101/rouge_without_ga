public key cryptography is a cryptographic technique that enables entities to secure communication on an insecure public network , and reliably verify the identity of an entity via digital signatures a public key infrastructure ( pki ) is a system for the creation , storage , and distribution of digital certificates which are used to verify that a particular public key belongs to a certain entity a pki consists of : a certificate authority ( ca ) that stores , issues and signs the digital certificates ; a registration authority ( ra ) which verifies the identity of entities requesting their digital certificates to be stored at the ca ; a central directory—i.e , a secure location in which keys are stored and indexed ; a certificate management system managing things like the access to stored certificates or the delivery of the certificates to be issued ; a certificate policy stating the pki 's requirements concerning its procedures broadly speaking , there have traditionally been three approaches to getting this trust : certificate authority ( cas ) , web of trust ( wot ) , and simple public key infrastructure ( spki ) when the ca is a third party separate from the user and the system , then it is called the registration authority ( ra ) , which may or may not be separate from the ca the key-to-user binding is established , depending on the level of assurance the binding has , by software or under human supervision in this model of trust relationships , a ca is a trusted third party – trusted both by the subject ( owner ) of the certificate and by the party relying upon the certificate according to netcraft report from 2015 , the industry standard for monitoring active transport layer security ( tls ) certificates , states that '' although the global tls ecosystem is competitive , it is dominated by a handful of major cas — three certificate authorities ( symantec , sectigo , godaddy ) account for three-quarters of all issued tls certificates on public-facing web servers the singular term '' web of trust '' does not imply the existence of a single web of trust , or common point of trust , but rather one of any number of potentially disjoint '' webs of trust '' one of the benefits of the web of trust , such as in pgp , is that it can interoperate with a pki ca fully trusted by all parties in a domain ( such as an internal ca in a company ) that is willing to guarantee certificates , as a trusted introducer if the '' web of trust '' is completely trusted then , because of the nature of a web of trust , trusting one certificate is granting trust to all the certificates in that web a pki is only as valuable as the standards and practices that control the issuance of certificates and including pgp or a personally instituted web of trust could significantly degrade the trustworthiness of that enterprise 's or domain 's implementation of pki ed gerck , overview of certification systems : x.509 , ca , pgp and skip , in the black hat briefings '99 , and the web of trust concept was first put forth by pgp creator phil zimmermann in 1992 in the manual for pgp version 2.0 : another alternative , which does not deal with public authentication of public key information , is the simple public key infrastructure ( spki ) that grew out of three independent efforts to overcome the complexities of x.509 and pgp 's web of trust while blockchain technology can approximate the proof of work often underpinning the confidence in trust that relying parties have in a pki , issues remain such as administrative conformance to policy , operational security and software implementation quality with the further development of high-speed digital electronic communications ( the internet and its predecessors ) , a need became evident for ways in which users could securely communicate with each other , and as a further consequence of that , for ways in which users could be sure with whom they were actually interacting taher elgamal and others at netscape developed the ssl protocol ( 'https ' in web urls ) ; it included key establishment , server authentication ( prior to v3 , one-way only ) , and so on stephen wilson , december 2005 , '' the importance of pki today '' , china communications , retrieved on 2010-12-13 pkis have not solved some of the problems they were expected to , and several major vendors have gone out of business or been acquired by others pkis of one type or another , and from any of several vendors , have many uses , including providing public keys and bindings to user identities which are used for : encryption and/or sender authentication of e-mail messages ( e.g , secret key—methods ; mobile signatures are electronic signatures that are created using a mobile device and rely on signature or certification services in a location independent telecommunication environment ; mark gasson , martin meints , kevin warwick ( 2005 ) , d3.2 : a study on pki and biometrics , fidis deliverable ( 3 ) 2 , july 2005 internet of things requires secure communication between mutually trusted devices it is a toolkit , developed in c , that is included in all major linux distributions , and can be used both to build your own ( simple ) ca and to pki-enable applications when a key is known to be compromised , it could be fixed by revoking the certificate , but such a compromise is not easily detectable and can be a huge security breach
