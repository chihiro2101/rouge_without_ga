in a third-season episode hank says cotton is 70 , and in the season 4 episode '' cotton comes marching home '' , he states himself to be 71 little is known about cotton 's childhood other than that he started out with a gun at an early age according to hank in the episode '' how to fire a rifle without really trying '' , that he attended fort birk when he was very young and spent much of his childhood there as he revealed in '' an officer and a gentle boy '' , that he apparently joined the army when he was only 14 years old as revealed in '' shins of the father '' , and that cotton 's mother apparently died giving birth to him , as he exaggerates in '' death picks cotton '' almost nothing is known about cotton 's father , except that he may have been german , as peggy tells bobby in the episode '' tears of an inflatable clown '' and the only time cotton ever himself refers to his father during the entire series is when he shouts at hank : '' you ai n't my daddy , i 'm your daddy ! '' he was referred to as a colonel repeatedly during the series , reflecting his rank in the texas state guard after the war in the 12th episode of season 11 , he is wearing the third class of the legion of honor , the highest award given by the french government , who gave it to a select handful of american troops for their service in world war ii he has a number of war trophies that can be seen in various episodes , including a prussian pickelhaube which he sometimes used to cut hank 's hair in an even bowl cut during hank 's youth , and a nazi canoe which he claimed was '' hitler 's canoe '' , though given his propensity to exaggerate his war stories , the actual origin of the canoe is uncertain the pride he has in his military service often colors his opinions of others ; he has often expressed disdain for hank 's lack of service , and enjoys making fun of his son for being excluded due to his narrow urethra ( '' cotton 's plot '' ) he had also learned to stop his heartbeat , so the japanese would stop torturing him for a moment , probably at the p.o.w before leaving japan , cotton had an affair with a japanese nurse , michiko , which resulted in the birth of his eldest son ( and hank 's older half-brother ) , junichiro ( voiced by david carradine ) ; he left suddenly despite trying to stay , and knew nothing of his child until years later ( a flashback clip shows him being clubbed and dragged onto the troopship leaving japan ) ( '' returning japanese '' ) when cotton saw that hank and junichiro had mended fences and even become friends , and junichiro said that he was not ashamed to be a hill any more , cotton ditched his plan and accepted the emperor 's kind words he also made peace with junichiro 's mother , who tore a picture taken of them as young adults after world war ii in halfâ€”and gave the half with her picture to cotton , while keeping his picture for herself cotton claimed he divorced from hank 's mother , tilly , because he '' outgrew '' her after she lost her large rear end , though it had been stated earlier in the show - such as in the season 1 episode '' shins of a father '' - that tilly divorced him after years of verbal abuse his second wife was a hospital volunteer , deirdre '' didi '' hill , who is implied to be the same age as hank as hank claims that the two went to kindergarten together ( according to episode 1-08 , '' shins of the father '' ) cotton 's relationship with hank was strained ; while hank seemed to have a deep reverence ( and fear ) of his father , he stood up to cotton on several occasions in spite of all this , however , cotton never hesitated to refer to hank as '' my boy , '' and on several occasions tried to help him ( such as when kahn and minh were befouling his house ) throughout the series , cotton has also shown several times that he may actually care for hank , such as calling him a good son in '' returning japanese '' , saving him from being shot in the episode '' yankee hankee '' , and leaving and trusting hank with his last requests and personal possessions in '' serving me right for giving george s it is likely cotton treats hank horribly simply because he hates various aspects of hank 's life , such as his job as a propane salesman , his place of birth ( new york ) , his personality , how he chooses to raise bobby , his marriage to peggy , how he is different from his cousin dusty , how hank thwarted his plan to assassinate fidel castro ( tilly had went into labor just as cotton was about to kill the communist leader ) , and - most importantly - how hank did not follow in his father 's footsteps and become a war hero '' in '' revenge of the lutefisk '' , cotton even goes so far as to take the blame for bobby after bobby confesses he was the one who burned down the church ( claiming '' i 'm an old man , everyone already hates me ! '' whereas bobby is just a child and has his whole life ahead of him throughout his history on the series , cotton never once addressed peggy by name , but he instead called her '' hank 's wife '' , which was used as a running gag , including on the very rare occasion he 's trying to be nice to her ( the only other name cotton had ever addressed peggy by was '' hillary '' in the episode '' shins of the father '' ; peggy also did n't seem to care being called '' hank 's wife '' beyond visible annoyance , and never once told cotton not to call her that ) on rare occasions , cotton shows a vulnerable side that he normally keeps hidden : he realizes that he was a terrible father and person , hates himself for growing old and becoming disabled , and readily admits that he would die to protect his grandson , bobby ( '' revenge of the lutefisk '' ) cotton has also shown in multiple episodes that he suffers from mild to severe post traumatic stress disorder ( ptsd ) ( '' returning japanese '' & '' death picks cotton '' ) , which can explain the majority of his '' violent outbursts '' in spite of his injuries and a heart attack suffered while in the hospital , cotton survives long enough to torment both hank and peggy , even slowing his heartbeat down to feign death ( a trick he learned while confined to a japanese pow camp ) the last person to see him alive is peggy , who tells him that despite cotton 's constant torture of his son , hank has always loved him and that she hopes he will live forever in the friendless , spiteful existence he has made for himself as the unhappy , unpleasant person he is hank initially plans to honor a separate wish , to have cotton 's head detached from his body and sent to the emperor of japan , but peggy stops him by ( falsely ) claiming that cotton withdrew the request just before his death he was to have been buried at the texas state cemetery , a grave which he earned in recognition of his military service , as explained by the episode '' cotton 's plot '' , although he ended up being cremated instead hill suffered from several injuries ranging from four rusty bullets lodged in his back ( one in his heart ) from his military service , a broken hip and torn ligaments in his ankle-knees , to an infection in his esophagus and severe burns caused by a freak shrimp accident that occurred earlier this week at tokyaki 's japanese restaurant ( short for '' good hank '' ) ; daughter-in-law peggy hill ; grandson bobby hill ; ex-wife tilly ; second wife didi ; first love and former japanese lover michiko ; an illegitimate japanese son , junichiro ; and nephew dusty hill ( of band zz top )
