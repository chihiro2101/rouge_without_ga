conventions shifted in the early 1960s , at which point record companies started assigning the song they wanted radio stations to play to side a , as 45 rpm single records ( '' 45s '' ) dominated most markets in terms of cash sales in comparison to album , which did not fare as well financially nevertheless , fm rock stations did not like to play monaural content , so the record companies adopted a protocol for promotional recording for disc jockeys with the mono version of a song on one side and a stereo version of the same song on the other in the last few decades , the industry has largely shifted away from physical media towards digital music distribution formats , further diminishing the relevance of terminology or marketing strategies based on “ sides ” today , companies label non-album songs and tracks deemed less desirable or marketable using terms such as '' unreleased , ” , '' bonus , ” , '' non-album , ” '' rare , ” '' outtakes , ” or '' exclusive , instrumental , a cappella , live , acoustic , remixed version or in another language ) , or , in a concept album , a song that does not fit into the story line similarly , it has also been alleged that owners of pirate radio stations operating off the british coast in the 1960s would buy the publishing rights to the b-sides of records they expected to be hits , and then plug the a-sides in the hope of driving up sales and increasing their share of the royalties some examples include '' i will survive '' by gloria gaynor ( originally the b-side of '' substitute '' ) , '' ice ice baby '' by vanilla ice ( originally the b-side of '' play that funky music '' ) , '' i 'll be around '' by the spinners ( originally the b-side of '' how could i let you get away '' ) and '' maggie may '' by rod stewart ( originally the b-side of '' reason to believe '' ) the song '' how soon is now ? '' by the smiths started out as the extra track on the 12-inch of william , it was really nothing but later gained a separate release as an a-side in its own right , as did oasis 's '' acquiesce '' , which originally appeared as a b-side to '' some might say '' in 1995 , but gained subsequent release in 2006 as part of an ep to promote their forthcoming compilation album , stop the clocks in 1986 , the first single from xtc 's record skylarking , '' grass '' , was eclipsed in the united states by its b-side , '' dear god '' – so much so that the record was almost immediately re-released with one song ( '' mermaid smiled '' ) removed and '' dear god '' put in its place , becoming one of the band 's better-known hits a '' double a-side '' or '' aa-side '' is a single where both sides are designated the a-side , with no designated b-side ; that is , both sides are '' hits '' or prospective hit songs and neither side will be promoted over the other the term '' b/w '' , an abbreviation of '' backed with '' , is often used in listings to indicate the b-side of a record
