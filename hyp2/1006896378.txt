to give a feel for the difference between the byzantine form of text and the eclectic text , which is mainly alexandrian in character , of 800 variation units in the epistle of james collected by the institute for new testament textual research , the byzantine and eclectic texts are in agreement in 731 of the places ( a rate of 92.3 % ) in order to displace the textus receptus ( see the following section ) from its initially prominent position among printed editions of the greek new testament , later textual scholars of the critical text persuasion saw the need for a thoroughgoing theory of the transmission of the text that could effectively disregard the overwhelmingly numerical superiority of the byzantine text which formed its base that after the western roman empire stopped using greek , and because of barbarian and muslim invasions , eliminating the possibility for either jerusalem or caesarea to exercise any further influence on the text of the greek new testament , the only church to actively preserve the greek text was the eastern orthodox church , which exercised central control from the see of constantinople and withstood the muslims until the 15th century the different byzantine '' majority text '' of hodges & farstad as well as robinson & pierpont is called '' majority '' because it is considered to be the greek text established on the basis of the reading found in the vast majority of the greek manuscripts although the majority of new testament textual critics now favor a text that is alexandrian in complexion , especially after the publication of westcott and hort 's edition , there remain some proponents of the byzantine text-type as the type of text most similar to the autographs zuurmond notes that , especially in the gospel of john , the form of the early byzantine text found in the ethiopic gospels is quite different from the later greek majority text , and agrees in a number of places with papyrus 66 according to the preface to the new king james version of the bible , the textus receptus , the alexandrian text-type and the byzantine text-type are 85 % identical ( that is , of the variations that occur in any manuscript , only 15 % actually differ between these three ) the ethiopic text in the gospels of mark and matthew are closer to the greek majority text , while still differing in a number of notable readings ; but the ethiopic text of the rest of the new testament is clearly alexandrian the second earliest translation to witness to a greek base conforming generally to the byzantine text in the gospels is the syriac peshitta ( though it has many alexandrian and western readings ) ; usually dated to the beginning of the 5th century ; although in respect of several much contested readings , such as mark 1:2 and john 1:18 , the peshitta rather supports the alexandrian witnesses k r : no uncials , no early minuscules , hundreds of minuscules : 18 , 35 , 55 , 66 , 83 , 128 , 141 , 147 , 155 , 167 , 170 , 189 , 201 k 1 ( subfamily of k x ) : s v ω 461 k i ( family e ) : e f g h i k ( also k a ) , now family π : ( a ) k y π ; this subgroup is the oldest , but only 5 % of manuscripts belong to it '' among those modern scholars who believe that the byzantine text is only a secondary witness to the original text of the autographs , there is some debate concerning the origin of the byzantine text and the reasons for its widespread existence and use the form of the byzantine text found in the earliest witnesses is not a monolithic whole ; but sometimes differs consistently from the form of text found in the most common sub-group of byzantine manuscripts as they proliferated after the 11th century amongst the bulk of later new testament manuscripts it is generally possible to demonstrate a clear byzantine majority reading for each variant ; and a greek new testament text based on these majority readings— '' the majority text '' —has been produced by zane c ) the standard byzantine text used by the eastern , greek-speaking greek orthodox church is supported by late minuscule manuscripts dating after the 4th century von soden divided manuscripts of the byzantine text into five groups : k x : no uncials , hundreds of minuscules , among them codex 2 , 3 , 8 , 14 , 45 , 47 , 49 , 51 , 54 , 56 , 58 , 59 , 60 , 61 , 73 , 75 , 76 , 78 , etc '' in the discussion that follows , they reason that the '' incalculable and fortuitous complexity of the causes here at work '' in the transmission of the text leads them to the conclusion that '' every ground for expecting ' a priori ' any sort of correspondence of numerical proportion between existing documents and their less numerous ancestors in any one age falls to the ground
