in 1916 , mit succeeded in moving across the charles river from crowded back bay , boston to larger facilities on the southern riverfront of cambridge , but still faced the prospect of merger with harvard , maclaurin quoted : '' in future harvard agrees to carry out all its work in engineering and mining in the buildings of technology under the executive control of the president of technology , and , what is of the first importance , to commit all instruction and the laying down of all courses to the faculty of technology , after that faculty has been enlarged and strengthened by the addition to its existing members of men of eminence from harvard 's graduate school of applied science on march 17 the british fleet carrying 11000 effective men and 1000 refuges , dropped down to nantasket roads and thenceforth boston was free , a strong british force had been expelled from one of the united american colonies ( evacuation monument - dorchester heights monument , boston , massachusetts , 1902 ) to the men of boston who died for their country on land and sea in the war which kept the union whole , destroyed slavery and maintained the constitution the board of overseers had hitherto consisted of the governor , lieutenant-governor , president of the state senate , speaker of the house , secretary of the board of education , and president and treasurer of the university , together with thirty other persons , and these other persons were elected by joint ballot of the two houses of the state legislature president eliot edited the harvard classics , which together are colloquially known as his five foot shelf five foot shelf and which were intended at the time to suggest a foundation for informed discourse , '' a good substitute for a liberal education in youth to anyone who would read them with devotion , even if he could spare but fifteen minutes a day for reading an opinion had long been gaining ground that it would be better for the community and the interests of learning , as well as for the university , if the power to elect the overseers were transferred from the legislature to the graduates of the college '' the problem , both in terms of fully developing an individual 's capacities and in maximizing his social utility , was to present him with a course of study sufficiently representative so as '' to reveal to him , or at least to his teachers and parents , his capacities and tastes in 1905 , the new york times reported that he called it '' a fight whose strategy and ethics are those of war '' , that violation of rules can not be prevented , that '' the weaker man is considered the legitimate prey of the stronger '' and that '' no sport is wholesome in which ungenerous or mean acts which easily escape detection contribute to victory while he proposed the reform of professional schools , the development of research faculties , and , in general , a huge broadening of the curriculum , his blueprint for undergraduate education in crucial ways preserved — and even enhanced — its traditional spiritual and character education functions ” upon his death in 1926 , the new york times published a full-page interview that eliot had given as he neared the end of his life , including excerpts from his writings on education , religion , democracy , labor , '' woman '' , and americanism woodrow wilson said of him , “ no man has ever made a deeper impression of the educational system of a country than president eliot has upon the educational system of america , ” while theodore roosevelt exclaimed , “ he is the only man in the world i envy as leader of the nation 's wealthiest and best-known university , eliot was necessarily a celebrated figure whose opinions were sought on a wide variety of matters , from tax policy ( he offered the first coherent rationale for the charitable tax exemption ) to the intellectual welfare of the general public he further stated : on the subject of educational reform , he declared : under eliot 's leadership , harvard adopted an '' elective system '' which vastly expanded the range of courses offered and permitted undergraduates unrestricted choice in selecting their courses of study — with a view to enabling them to discover their '' natural bents '' and pursue them into specialized studies charles eliot was a fearless crusader not only for educational reform , but for many of the goals of the progressive movement—whose most prominent figurehead was theodore roosevelt ( class of 1880 ) and most eloquent spokesman was herbert croly ( class of 1889 ) another son , samuel atkins eliot ii ( august 24 , 1862 – october 15 , 1950 ) became a unitarian minister who was the longest-serving president of the american unitarian association ( 1900–1927 ) and was the first president granted executive authority of that organization '' when the revelation of his own peculiar taste and capacity comes to a young man , let him reverently give it welcome , thank god , and take courage , '' eliot declared in his inaugural address johns hopkins university 1903 officer legion of honor ( france ) 1904 corresponding member academy moral and political science , institute of france 1908 grand officer order of the crown of italy 1909 imperial order of the rising sun , 1st class ; royal order of merit of the prussian crown , 1st class ; fellow royal society of literature ( england ) ; ll.d the effect of this change was to greatly strengthen the interest of the alumni in the management of the university , and thus to prepare the way for extensive and thorough reforms at the same time , eliot was radically opposed to labor unions , fostering a campus climate where many harvard students served as strikebreakers ; he was called by some '' the greatest labor union hater in the country some backed the establishment of specialized schools of science and technology , like harvard 's lawrence scientific school , yale 's sheffield scientific school , and the newly chartered massachusetts institute of technology , about to offer its first classes in 1865 early in 1869 , eliot had presented his ideas about reforming american higher education in a compelling two-part article , '' the new education , '' in the atlantic monthly , the nation 's leading journal of opinion during his lengthy tenure as harvard 's leader , eliot initiated repeated attempts to acquire his former employer , the fledgling massachusetts institute of technology , and these efforts continued even after he stepped down from the presidency eliot house , one of the seven original residential houses for undergraduates at the college , was named in honor of eliot and opened in 1931 the much younger college had considerable financial problems during its first five decades , and had been repeatedly rescued from insolvency by various benefactors , including george eastman , the founder of eastman kodak company eliot mountain was named in honor of the lifelong academic who summered on mount desert island , maine , and was a key figure in the creation of acadia national park '' we are fighting a wilderness , physical and moral , '' eliot declared in setting forth his vision of the american university , '' for this fight we must be trained and armed
