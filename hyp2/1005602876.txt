romantic relationships have been defined in countless ways , by writers , philosophers , religions , scientists , and in the modern day , relationship counselors as the merriam webster dictionary explains platonic love as , '' love conceived by plato as ascending from passion for the individual to contemplation of the universal and ideal as emerging adults mature , they begin to develop attachment and caring qualities in their relationships , including love , bonding , security , and support for partners most psychologists and relationship counselors predict a decline of intimacy and passion over time , replaced by a greater emphasis on companionate love ( differing from adolescent companionate love in the caring , committed , and partner-focused qualities ) however , couple studies have found no decline in intimacy nor in the importance of sex , intimacy , and passionate love to those in longer or later-life relationships older women in particular face social , demographic , and personal barriers ; men aged 65 and older are nearly twice as likely as women to be married , and widowers are nearly three times as likely to be dating 18 months following their partner 's loss compared to widows cohabiting relationships continue to rise , with many partners considering cohabitation to be nearly as serious as , or a substitute for , marriage the strain of 'internalized homo-negativity ' and of presenting themselves in line with socially acceptable gender norms can reduce the satisfaction and emotional and health benefits they experience in their relationships nonetheless , comparative studies of homosexual and heterosexual couples have found few differences in relationship intensity , quality , satisfaction , or commitment in ancient times , parent-child relationships were often marked by fear , either of rebellion or abandonment , resulting in the strict filial roles in , for example , ancient rome and china freud conceived of the oedipal complex , the supposed obsession that young boys have towards their mother and the accompanying fear and rivalry with their father , and the electra complex , in which the young girl feels that her mother has castrated her and therefore becomes obsessed with her father in a series of studies using the strange situation , a scenario in which an infant is separated from then reunited with the parent , ainsworth defined three styles of parent-child relationship securely attached infants miss the parent , greet them happily upon return , and show normal exploration and lack of fear when the parent is present insecure avoidant infants show little distress upon separation and ignore the caregiver when they return ; they explore little when the parent is present insecure ambivalent infants are highly distressed by separation , but continue to be distressed upon the parent 's return ; these infants also explore little and display fear even when the parent is present some psychologists have suggested a fourth attachment style , disorganized , so called because the infants ’ behavior appeared disorganized or disoriented although adolescents are more risk-seeking , and emerging adults have higher suicide rates , they are largely less volatile and have much better relationships with their parents than this model would suggest early adolescence often marks a decline in parent-child relationship quality , which then re-stabilizes through adolescence , and relationships are sometimes better in late adolescence than prior to its onset during this stage , interpersonal relationships are considered to be more self-focused , and relationships with parents may still be influential sibling relationships are affected by parent-child relationships , such that sibling relationships in childhood often reflect the positive or negative aspects of children 's relationships with their parents they tend to grow and improve gradually , as people get to know each other and become closer emotionally , or they gradually deteriorate as people drift apart , move on with their lives and form new relationships with others according to the model , the natural development of a relationship follows five stages : acquaintance and acquaintanceship – becoming acquainted depends on previous relationships , physical proximity , first impressions , and a variety of other factors if two people begin to like each other , continued interactions may lead to the next stage , but acquaintance can continue indefinitely continuation – this stage follows a mutual commitment to quite a strong and close long-term friendship , romantic relationship , or even marriage ) ending – the final stage marks the end of the relationship , either by breakups , death or by spatial separation for quite some time and severing all existing ties of either friendship or romantic love according to the latest systematic review of the economic literature on the factors associated with life satisfaction ( dating from 2007 ) , stable and secure relationships are beneficial , and correspondingly , relationship dissolution is harmful they also recommend some ways to cope with the experience : purposefully focussing on the positive aspects of the breakup ( '' factors leading up to the break-up , the actual break-up , and the time right after the break-up '' ) minimising the negative emotions journaling the positive aspects of the breakup ( e.g '' comfort , confidence , empowerment , energy , happiness , optimism , relief , satisfaction , thankfulness , and wisdom '' ) in fact , the need to belong is so innately ingrained that it may be strong enough to overcome physiological and safety needs , such as children 's attachment to abusive parents or staying in abusive romantic relationships being submissive can be beneficial because it saves time , emotional stress , and may avoid hostile actions such as withholding of resources , cessation of cooperation , termination of the relationship , maintaining a grudge , or even physical violence this can reduce time wasted in conflict over unimportant decisions , prevents inconsistent decisions from harming the operations of the organization , maintain alignment of a large population of workers with the goals of the owners ( which the workers might not personally share ) and if promotion is based on merit , help ensure that the people with the best expertise make important decisions for example , a feudal society under a monarchy exhibits a strong dominance hierarchy in both economics and physical power , whereas dominance relationships in a society with democracy and capitalism are more complicated for example , a business may adopt a submissive attitude to customer preferences ( stocking what customers want to buy ) and complaints ( '' the customer is always right '' ) in order to earn more money for example , in a friendship or romantic relationship , one person may have strong opinions about where to eat dinner , whereas the other has strong opinions about how to decorate a shared space this can be explained by unique aspects of the ldrs , how the individuals use relationship maintenance behaviors , and the attachment styles of the individuals in the relationships therefore , the costs and benefits of the relationship are subjective to the individual , and people in ldrs tend to report lower costs and higher rewards in their relationship compared to prs the individual stands simultaneously in several different relationships with different people : as a junior in relation to parents and elders , and as a senior in relation to younger siblings , students , and others '' five components of '' minding '' include : knowing and being known : seeking to understand the partner making relationship-enhancing attributions for behaviors : giving the benefit of the doubt accepting and respecting : empathy and social skills maintaining reciprocity : active participation in relationship enhancement continuity in minding : persisting in mindfulness aside from direct effects on the development , maintenance , and perception of romantic relationships , excessive social network usage is linked to jealousy and dissatisfaction in relationships
