the conditions for feedback follow the barkhausen stability criterion , namely that , with sufficiently high gain , a stable oscillation can ( and usually will ) occur in a feedback loop whose frequency is such that the phase delay is an integer multiple of 360 degrees and the gain at that frequency is equal to 1 if the gain is large , but slightly less than 1 , then high-pitched slowly decaying feedback tones will be created , but only when at least some input sound is already being sent through the system , such as through a microphone as sound pressure falls off with 1/r with respect to the distance r in free space , or up to a distance known as reverberation distance in closed spaces ( and the energy density with 1/rÂ² ) , it is important to keep the microphones at a large enough distance from the speaker systems professional setups circumvent feedback by placing the main speakers a far distance from the band or artist , and then having several smaller speakers known as monitors pointing back at each band member , but in the opposite direction to that in which the microphones are pointing this leads to acoustical feedback at the frequency with the highest loop gain , which may be much higher than the average gain over all frequencies ( resonance ) ) some of these work by shifting the frequency slightly , with this upshift resulting in a '' chirp '' -sound instead of a howling sound of unaddressed feedback to intentionally create feedback , an electric guitar player needs a guitar amplifier and a loudspeaker cabinet , with very high gain ( amplification ) and/or the guitar brought near the speaker according to allmusic 's richie unterberger , the very first use of feedback on a commercial rock record is the introduction of the song '' i feel fine '' by the beatles , recorded in 1964 the who 's 1965 hits '' anyway , anyhow , anywhere '' and '' my generation '' featured feedback manipulation by pete townshend , with an extended solo in the former and the shaking of his guitar in front of the amplifier to create a throbbing noise in the latter canned heat 's '' fried hockey boogie '' ( off of their 1968 album boogie with canned heat ) also featured guitar feedback produced by henry vestine during his solo to create a highly amplified distorted boogie style of feedback feedback has since become a striking characteristic of rock music , as electric guitar players such as jeff beck , pete townshend , dave davies , steve marriott and jimi hendrix deliberately induced feedback by holding their guitars close to the guitar amplifier in addition to '' i feel fine '' , feedback was used on the introduction to songs including jimi hendrix 's '' foxy lady '' , the beatles ' '' it 's all too much '' , hendrix 's '' crosstown traffic '' , david bowie 's '' little wonder '' , the strokes 's '' new york city cops '' , ben folds five 's '' fair '' , midnight juggernauts 's '' road to recovery '' , nirvana 's '' radio friendly unit shifter '' , the jesus and mary chain 's '' tumbledown '' and '' catchfire '' , the stone roses 's '' waterfall '' , porno for pyros 's '' tahitian moon '' , tool 's '' stinkfist '' , and the cure 's '' prayer for rain '' examples of feedback combined with a quick volume swell used as a transition include weezer 's '' my name is jonas '' and '' say it ai n't so '' ; the strokes ' '' reptilia '' , '' new york city cops '' , and '' juicebox '' ; dream theater 's '' as i am '' ; as well as numerous tracks by meshuggah and tool though closed circuit feedback was a prominent feature in many early experimental electronic music compositions , it was contemporary american composer robert ashley who first used acoustic feedback as sound material in his work the wolfman ( 1964 ) steve reich makes extensive use of audio feedback in his work pendulum music ( 1968 ) by swinging a series of microphones back and forth in front of their corresponding amplifiers examples include tool 's '' jambi '' , robert fripp 's guitar on david bowie 's '' heroes '' ( album version ) , and jimi hendrix 's '' third stone from the sun '' and his live performance of '' wild thing '' at the monterey pop festival with the alternative rock movement of the 1990s , feedback again saw a surge in popular usage by suddenly mainstream acts like nirvana , the red hot chili peppers , rage against the machine and the smashing pumpkins examples include handheld devices like the ebow , built-in guitar pickups that increase the instrument 's sonic sustain , string drivers mounted on a stand such as the guitar resonator , and sonic transducers mounted on the head of a guitar
