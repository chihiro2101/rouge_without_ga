the india board instructed auckland : to watch more closely than has hitherto been attempted the progress of events in afghanistan , and to counteract the progress of russian influence.the mode of dealing with this very important question , whether by dispatching a confidential agent to dost mohammed of kabul merely to watch the progress of events , or to enter into relations with this chief , either of a political or merely in the first instance of a commercial character , we confide in your discretion as well as the adoption of any other measures that may appear to you desirable to counteract russian influence in that quarter , should you be satisfied.that the time has arrived at which it would be right for you to interfere decidedly in the affairs of afghanistan the great game is said to have begun on 12 january 1830 when lord ellenborough , the president of the board of control for india tasked lord william bentinck , the governor-general of india , to establish a new trade route to bukhara on 21 january 1873 , great britain and russia signed an agreement that stipulated that the eastern badakhshan area as well as the wakhan corridor to zorkul were afghan territory , the northern afghan boundary was the amu darya ( oxus river ) as far west as khwaja salar ( near khamyab ) , and a joint russian-british commission would define the boundary from the amu darya to the persian border on the hari ( afghanistan ) petersburg , russia to the caspian desert , to kir ( northern iran ) , was detained in astrabad ( northern iran ) as a russian spy , then travelled with a caravan of pilgrims to meshed , marched with the afghan army from there to herat , then traveled to kandahar , to quetta , then across the thar desert to the british frontier in january 1831 britain had no intention of getting involved in the middle east , but it did envision a series of buffer states between the british and russian empires that included turkey , persia , plus the khanate of khiva and the khanate of bukhara that would grow from future trade '' conolly believed that rawlinson 's new post gave him the opportunity to advance humanitarianism in afghanistan , and summed up his hopes : if the british government would only play the grand game – help russia cordially to all that she has a right to expect – shake hands with persia – get her all possible amends from uzbeks – force the bukhara amir to be just to us , the afghans , and other oosbeg states , and his own kingdom – but why go on ; you know my , at any rate in one sense , enlarged views the agreement was regarded as having defined the british and russian spheres of influence in afghanistan and central asia , gave the two sides the legitimacy to advance within their designated zones , created cordial relations between the two rival european powers , and raised the new problem of defining what were the frontiers of afghanistan , russia and china in the upper oxus region in the pamir mountains in 1782 george forster , a civil servant of the east india company , undertook a journey that began in calcutta , bengal and passed through kashmir , afghanistan , herat , khorassan , mazanderan , crossed the caspian sea by ship , and then travelled to baku , astrakhan , moscow , st petersburg and then by ship to london in october 1838 auckland issued the simla manifesto , a piece of propaganda designed to blacken the reputation of dost mohammad khan ( emir of afghanistan ) and which claimed that dost mohammad : openly threatened.to call in every foreign aid that he could command.we could never hope that the tranquility of our neighborhood could be secured.the governor-general confidently hopes that the shah will speedily be replaced on his throne.the independence and integrity of afghanistan restored , the british army will be withdrawn russia was fearful of british commercial and military inroads into central asia , and britain was fearful of russia adding the '' jewel in the crown '' , india , to the vast empire that russia was building in asia britain believed that it was the world 's first free society and the most industrially advanced country , and therefore that it had a duty to use its iron , steam power , and cotton goods to take over central asia and develop it the khanates must guarantee the safety of the persons and property of russian merchants , levy no excessive duties , permit unhampered transit of goods and caravans across central asia into neighboring states and allow russian commercial agents to reside in bukhara and khiva , and free navigation on the amu darya river for russian ships the agreement was negotiated by russian diplomat prince alexander gorchakov , the lands of badakhshan and wakhan were accepted by russia as part of afghanistan , russia accepted all of britain 's proposals on afghanistan 's northern borders and expected that britain would keep afghanistan from committing any aggression on hearing of the execution of the two british officers , emperor nicholas i of russia would no longer receive bukhara 's gifts or emissaries , and its ambassador was turned back at orenburg with a message that the emperor would no longer have anything to do with the emir of bukhara lord lytton , the viceroy of british india , ordered a diplomatic mission to set out for kabul in september 1878 but the mission was turned back as it approached the eastern entrance of the khyber pass , triggering the second anglo–afghan war the treaty of gandamak of 1879 required that amir abdur rahman khan had to accept british control of afghanistan 's foreign relations and to cede to the british a number of its southern frontier areas , including the districts of pishin , sibi , harnai , and thal chotiali additionally , persia intended to annex herat to make up for territory it had lost in the russo-persian war ( 1826–28 ) , however the allegiance of herat to afghanistan was crucial to the british strategy in 1839 , acting captain james abbott of the bengal artillery undertook a mission to the khanate of khiva in an attempt to negotiate the release of russian slaves that would deny the russians a pretext for invading khiva the second anglo-sikh war was fought in 1848–1849 , resulting in subjugation of the remainder of the sikh empire , and the annexation of the punjab province and what subsequently became the north-west frontier province the expedition was funded by the east india company and was to map and research the regions of '' beloochistan '' ( balochistan ) and persia because of concerns about india being invaded by french forces from that direction during the 1840s and 1850s , russia 's aims in central asia were for bukhara and khiva to refrain from hostile actions against russia , cease possession of russian slaves and the granting of asylum to kazakhs fleeing from russian justice during the 19th century a political and diplomatic confrontation developed between britain and russia over afghanistan which later became known as '' the great game '' as the russian forces were close to herat , the british and russian governments formed a joint anglo-russian afghan boundary commission in the same year to define the borders between the russian empire and northern afghanistan the afghans claimed that the people of the district had always paid tribute to afghanistan , and the russians argued that this district was part of the khanates of khiva and merv which they had annexed earlier from 1869 to 1872 , mir mahmud shar was able to gain control of the khanate of badakhshan with the help of afghanistan 's new ruler , amir sher ali khan , and by 1873 afghanistan governed badakhshan the use of the term '' the great game '' to describe anglo-russian rivalry in central asia became common only after the second world war at the start of the 19th century , the indian subcontinent was ruled in part by independent princely states and in part by the company rule of the british east india company in 1869 , when clarendon proposed the amu darya river as the basis for a neutral zone between british and russian spheres of influence , alexander gorchakov proposed afghanistan as the neutral zone this eastward expansion was of no concern to the british foreign office because this area did not lie across any british trade routes or destinations , and therefore was of no interest to britain in 1864 , a circular was sent to the consular officers abroad by gorchakov , the russian chancellor , patiently explaining the reasons for expansion centering on the doctrines of necessity , power and spread of civilisation in july 1840 , in correspondence to major henry rawlinson who had been recently appointed as the new political agent in kandahar , conolly wrote , '' you 've a great game , a noble game , before you burnes , a christian travelling through a muslim country was one of the first to study afghanistan for british intelligence and upon his return , he published his book , travels to bukhara , which became an overnight success in 1834 if russia were to gain control of the emirate of afghanistan , it might then be used as a staging post for a russian invasion of india the new governor-general , lord ellenborough , decided to withdraw all british garrisons from afghanistan and dost mohammad khan was freed in india to return to the throne behind these buffer states would be their protected states stretching from the persian gulf to india and up into the emirate of afghanistan , with british sea-power protecting trade sea-lanes the attempted russian assault on khiva may have been in response to britain 's '' forward policy '' on afghanistan , however it failed to reach khiva due to the severe winter conditions britain did not aid afghanistan as was required by the treaty of gandamak , leading the amir to believe that he could not rely on the british in the face of russian aggression dost mohammad is reported to have said : i have been struck by the magnitude of your resources , your ships , your arsenals , but what i can not understand is why the rulers of so vast and flourishing an empire should have gone across the indus to deprive me of my poor and barren country in december , the british marched into afghanistan and arrested dost mohammad , sent him into exile in india and replaced him with the previous ruler , shah shuja , who shared their more progressive vision for the people of the region the term '' the great game '' was used well before the 19th century and was associated with games of risk , such as cards and dice russia feared british inroads on their commerce in central asia , as well as the influence that a muslim power with british support might have on the other khanates in 1837 , the russian envoy jan prosper witkiewicz visited kabul , and the british believed that it was to facilitate some form of diplomatic or military presence in afghanistan in 1801 paul , fearing a future action by the british against russia and her allies in europe , decided to make the first move towards where he believed the british empire was weakest
