'' 2 chronicles refers to '' mount moriah '' as the site of solomon 's temple , while psalms ; isaiah & ; and zechariah use the term '' the mount of the lord '' to refer to the site of solomon 's temple in jerusalem , the location believed to be the temple mount in jerusalem god 's commandment to abraham was very specific , and abraham understood it very precisely : isaac was to be '' raised up as an offering '' , and god would use the opportunity to teach humankind , once and for all , that human sacrifice , child sacrifice , is not acceptable , page 39 , the jewish publication society , 1999 in the guide for the perplexed , maimonides argues that the story of the binding of isaac contains two '' great notions '' second , because abraham acted on a prophetic vision of what god had asked him to do , the story exemplifies how prophetic revelation has the same truth value as philosophical argument and thus carries equal certainty , notwithstanding the fact that it comes in a dream or vision feldman argues that the story of isaac 's binding , in both its biblical and post-biblical versions ( the new testament included ) has had a great impact on the ethos of altruism heroism and self-sacrifice in modern hebrew national culture as her study demonstrates , over the last century the '' binding of isaac '' has morphed into the '' sacrifice of isaac '' , connoting both the glory and agony of heroic death on the battlefield in legends of the jews , rabbi louis ginzberg argues that the binding of isaac is a way for god to test isaac 's claim to ishmael , and to silence satan 's protest about abraham who had not brought up any offering to god after isaac was born , also to show a proof to the world that abraham is the true god-fearing man who is ready to fulfill any of god 's commands , even to sacrifice his own son : the book of genesis does not tell the age of isaac at the time levenson , lecture oct 13 , 2016 : '' genesis 22 : the binding of isaac and the crucifixion of jesus , starting at about 1:05:10 isaac 's reaction to the binding is unstated in the biblical narrative the binding of isaac is mentioned in the new testament epistle to the hebrews among many acts of faith recorded in the old testament : '' by faith abraham , when he was tested , offered up isaac , and he who had received the promises offered up his only begotten son , of whom it was said , 'in isaac your seed shall be called , ' concluding that god was able to raise him up , even from the dead , from which he also received him in a figurative sense for example , hippolytus of rome says in his commentary on the song of songs , '' the blessed isaac became desirous of the anointing and he wished to sacrifice himself for the sake of the world '' ( on the song 2:15 ) origen , homilies on genesis 11â€“13 this interpretation can be supported by symbolism and context such as abraham sacrificing his son on the third day of the journey ( genesis 22:4 ) , or abraham taking the wood and putting it on his son isaac 's shoulder ( genesis 22:6 ) as further support that the binding of isaac foretells the gospel of jesus christ , when the two went up there , isaac asked abraham '' where is the lamb for the burnt offering '' to which abraham responded '' god himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering , my son in the new testament , john the baptist saw jesus coming toward him and said '' look , the lamb of god , who takes away the sins of the world ! '' ( john 1:29 ) in islamic sources , when abraham tells his son about the vision , his son agreed to be sacrificed for the fulfillment of god 's command , and no binding to the altar occurred when they both had submitted their will to god and were ready for the sacrifice , god told abraham he had fulfilled the vision , and provided him with a ram to sacrifice instead one side of the argument believed it was isaac rather than ishmael ( notably ibn qutaybah and al-tabari ) interpreting the verse '' god 's perfecting his mercy on abraham and isaac '' as referring to his making abraham his closest one , and to his rescuing isaac the other side , by far a vast majority , held that the promise to sarah was of a son , isaac , and a grandson , jacob ( quran 11:71-74 ) excluded the possibility of a premature death of isaac in mimesis : the representation of reality in western literature , the literary critic erich auerbach considers the hebrew narrative of the binding of isaac , along with homer 's description of odysseus 's scar , as the two paradigmatic models for the representation of reality in literature auerbach contrasts homer 's attention to detail and foregrounding of the spatial , historical , as well as personal contexts for events to the bible 's sparse account , in which virtually all context is kept in the background or left outside of the narrative on that reading , in the original e version of the binding abraham disobeys god 's command , sacrificing the ram '' instead of his son '' ( v & nbsp ; 13 ) on his own responsibility and without being stopped by an angel : '' and abraham stretched forth his hand , and took the knife to slay his son ; but abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and beheld , behind him was a ram , caught in a thicket by his horns ; and abraham went , and took the ram , and offered it up as a burnt offering instead of his son '' ( v this analysis of the story sheds light on the connection between the binding and the story of sodom , in which abraham protests against god 's unethical plan to destroy the city , without distinguishing between the righteous and the wicked : '' far be it from you to do such a thing : shall not the judge of all the earth do what is just ? '' abraham 's ethical rebellion against god in the destruction of sodom culminates in his disobedience to god , refusing to sacrifice isaac it may be that the biblical story contains traces of a tradition in which abraham does sacrifice isaac , for in genesis & nbsp ; 22:19 abraham appears to return from the mountain without isaac friedman argued that in the original e story , abraham may have carried out the sacrifice of isaac , but that later repugnance at the idea of a human sacrifice led the redactor of je to add the lines in which a ram is substituted for isaac it has been suggested that genesis 22 contains an intrusion of the liturgy of a rite of passage , including mock sacrifice , as commonly found in early and preliterate societies , marking the passage from youth to adulthood
