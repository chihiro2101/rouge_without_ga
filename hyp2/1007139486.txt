born in palermo in september 1810 , during his parents ' exile , he was given the title duke of chartres ( and was called chartres within the family circle ) he was baptised ferdinand philippe louis charles henri and known as ferdinand philippe in honour of his grandfathers , ferdinand i of the two sicilies and philippe égalité as the eldest son , he was the heir to the title of duke of orléans , head of the house of orléans ( a cadet branch of the house of bourbon descended from the only brother of louis xiv ) after a trip to great britain ( visiting both england and scotland ) in 1819 , he went to lunéville to join the 1 er régiment de hussards , of which he was made colonel by charles x in 1824 when his father was offered the french throne by the chamber of deputies , prince ferdinand philippe received the title of duke of orléans , prince of orléans , and also became crown prince , the heir apparent to the throne upon entering the conseil ( at his father 's bidding ) , ferdinand philippe , who had something of a temper , criticised the time lost by ministers ' prevarications and was frequently embroiled in skirmishes with the doctrinaires , to whom he wished to impart the sentiments of revolutionary youth in the eyes of the people and the press he was seen as a generous prince , sincerely preoccupied with the plight of the poor , and he became a sort of icon for the dynastic opposition of politician odilon barrot , who saw in him the only prince capable of reconciling modern france 's democratic aspirations with the heritage of its monarchical past when he returned to paris , it was with an aura of military glory , and he returned to algeria in autumn 1839 to take possession of the country 's interior ( from constantine to algiers ) for france alongside maréchal count valée blanche-joséphine le bascle d'argenteuil noted , in her souvenirs , that if the prince royal died young after having fathered a male heir , the july monarchy would be faced with the prospect of a regency , in all its political uncertainty – thus , for her , the wisest course consisted of marrying off the king 's third son , then the fourth , then the fifth , guaranteeing louis philippe descendants , all the while leaving several men around the throne who could take over from him if he died suddenly 756 ) louis philippe next envisaged an alliance with austria via the marriage of his son to archduchess maria theresa ( born 1816 ) , daughter of archduke karl , duke of teschen ( german : herzog von teschen ) however , karl faced determined opponents on two sides & nbsp ; – prince metternich , who did not want to repeat his error in marrying marie louise to napoléon i , and archduchess sophie , a bavarian princess and sister-in-law of the new kaiser ferdinand i , who dominated the vienna court with her strong personality , and was awaiting her son franz-josef 's ascent to the imperial throne even if the young prince royal decidedly liked archduke karl and his daughter , prince metternich and the archduchess sophie put up a major barrage of problems , and news of thiers ( impatient to conclude the match ) being on his way was enough to convince louis philippe to make a marriage proposal i have always thought that chartres was of too high birth to marry she who seems to him the most minor princess in germany ; and i avow that i would better like to see him marry a princess from lippe or waldeck who was good and pretty and of robust health , rather than an archduchess of austria who would bring us all sorts of evils in her dowry 782 ) , and these were both very young for marriage ( born in 1821 ) : princess januaria of brazil , daughter of peter i of brazil , and the infanta isabella of spain , daughter of the infante francisco de paula , younger brother of king ferdinand vii the former was excluded by her remoteness , and the latter due to her family 's unfortunate history ( her mother princess luisa carlotta of the two sicilies , niece of queen marie-amélie , was monstrously obese ) and her physical appearance ( she was red-haired and thin ; queen louise wrote to queen marie-amélie on 21 november 1836 that '' i send you her portrait , that leopold found hideous via his great-niece the duchess of dino , talleyrand suggested louise of hesse-kassel ( born 1817 to a cousin of the elector of hesse and his wife , a danish princess ) , whilst queen louise suggested marie of saxe-altenburg ( born 1818 to the duke of saxe-altenburg and princess amelia of wurtemberg , and who finally ended up marrying george v of hanover in 1843 ) , and princess victoria of saxe-coburg and gotha ( daughter of an elder brother of leopold i of belgium ;
