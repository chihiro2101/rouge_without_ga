soyuz : the greatest spacecraft ever the best ride in the galaxy – coming back to earth in a soyuz soyuz spacecraft were used to carry cosmonauts to and from salyut and later mir soviet space stations , and are now used for transport to and from the international space station ( iss ) a soyuz spacecraft consists of three parts ( from front to back ) : a spheroid orbital module , which provides accommodation for the crew during their mission ; a small aerodynamic reentry module , which returns the crew to earth ; a cylindrical service module with solar panels attached , which contains the instruments and engines this allows smaller rockets to launch the spacecraft or can be used to increase the habitable space available to the crew in apollo cm vs in soyuz ) in the mass budget the atmosphere is regenerated through potassium superoxide ( ko 2 ) cylinders , which absorb most of the carbon dioxide ( co 2 ) and water produced by the crew and regenerates the oxygen , and lithium hydroxide ( lioh ) cylinders which absorb leftover co 2 the vostok spacecraft utilized an ejector seat to bail out the cosmonaut in the event of a low-altitude launch failure , as well as during reentry , however it would probably have been ineffective in the first 20 seconds after liftoff when the altitude would be too low for the parachute to deploy based on data from r-7 launches over the years , engineers developed a list of the most likely failure modes for the vehicle and could narrow down abort conditions to premature separation of a strap-on booster , low engine thrust , loss of combustion chamber pressure , or loss of booster guidance since it turned out to be almost impossible to separate the entire payload shroud from the soyuz service module cleanly , the decision was made to have the shroud split between the service module and descent module during an abort there have been three failed launches of a crewed soyuz vehicle , soyuz 18a in 1975 , soyuz t-10a in 1983 and soyuz ms-10 in october 2018 most recently in 2018 , the sas sub-system in the payload shroud of soyuz ms-10 successfully rescued the cosmonauts from a rocket failure 2 minutes and 45 second after liftoff after the escape tower had already been jettisoned on the latest soyuz versions ( since soyuz tm ) , a small window was introduced , providing the crew with a forward view separation of the orbital module is critical for a safe landing ; without separation of the orbital module , it is not possible for the crew to survive landing in the descent module the risk of not being able to separate the orbital module is effectively judged to be less than the risk of needing the facilities in it , including the toilet , following a failed deorbit a non-pressurized part of the service module ( propulsion compartment , contains the main engine and a liquid-fuelled propulsion system for maneuvering in orbit and initiating the descent back to earth an incomplete separation between the service and reentry modules led to emergency situations during soyuz 5 , soyuz tma-10 and soyuz tma-11 , which led to an incorrect reentry orientation ( crew ingress hatch first ) since the soyuz tm-5 landing issue , the orbital module is once again detached only after the reentry firing , which led to ( but did not cause ) emergency situations of soyuz tma-10 and tma-11 the orbital module can not remain in orbit as an addition to a space station , as the airlock hatch between the orbital and reentry modules is a part of the reentry module , and the orbital module therefore depressurizes after separation reentry firing is usually done on the '' dawn '' side of the earth , so that the spacecraft can be seen by recovery helicopters as it descends in the evening twilight , illuminated by the sun when it is above the shadow of the earth sergei korolev initially promoted the soyuz a-b-v circumlunar complex ( 7k-9k-11k ) concept ( also known as l1 ) in which a two-man craft soyuz 7k would rendezvous with other components ( 9k and 11k ) in earth orbit to assemble a lunar excursion vehicle , the components being delivered by the proven r-7 rocket soyuz 1 through soyuz 11 ( 1967 & ndash ; 1971 ) were first-generation vehicles , carrying a crew of up to three without spacesuits and distinguished from those following by their bent solar panels and their use of the igla automatic docking navigation system , which required special radar antennas the soyuz 7k-l1 was designed to launch a crew from the earth to circle the moon , and was the primary hope for a soviet circumlunar flight soyuz 7k-tm was the spacecraft used in the apollo–soyuz in 1975 , which saw the first and only docking of a soyuz spacecraft with an apollo command and service module thumb the soyuz-tm crew transports ( m : were fourth generation soyuz spacecraft , and were used from 1986 to 2003 for ferry flights to mir and the international space station ( iss ) image : soyuz tma-6 spacecraft.jpg thumb 290px the soyuz tma-6 soyuz tma ( a : features several changes to accommodate requirements requested by nasa in order to service the international space station ( iss ) , including more latitude in the height and weight of the crew and improved parachute systems name '' soyuzms2017 '' > major changes include : more efficient solar panels modified docking and attitude control engine positions for redundancy during docking and de-orbit burns new kurs na approach and docking system which weighs half as much and consumes a third of the power of previous system new tsvm-101 computer , about one eighth the weight ( 8.3 kg versus 70 kg ) and much smaller than the previous argon-16 computer unified digital command/telemetry system ( mbits ) to relay telemetry via satellite , and control spacecraft when out of sight of ground stations ; also provides the crew with position data when out of ground tracking range glonass/gps and cospas-sarsat satellite systems for more accurate location during search/rescue operations after landing while not being direct derivatives of soyuz , the chinese shenzhou spacecraft uses soyuz tm technology sold in 1984 and the indian gaganyaan follow the same general layout as that pioneered by soyuz image : soyuz national space centre.jpg early 7k-ok soyuz at national space centre in leicester , england image : soyuz 19 ( apollo soyuz test project ) spacecraft.jpg soyuz spacecraft of the apollo–soyuz test project ( astp ) image : soyuz acoplada mir.jpg soyuz docked to mir image : soyuz tma-19 docked to the rassvet mini-research module.jpg soyuz docked to iss image : soyuz spacecraft.jpg a soyuz mock-up shows how its modules are connected image : soyuz tm-31 transported to launch pad.jpg soyuz tm-31 moves to launch pad on 29 october 2000 image : soyuz tma-2 launch.jpg soyuz tma-2 launch from baikonur on april 26 , 2003 image : expedition 28 landing.jpg soyuz tma-21 with parachute deployed image : soyuz tma-17 retro-rockets firing during landing.jpg soyuz landing sequence image : jsc2006e33951.jpg training session in a soyuz simulator
