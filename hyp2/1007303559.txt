very low frequency waves below 30 & nbsp ; khz can be used to communicate at transcontinental distances , and can penetrate saltwater to depths of hundreds of feet , and is used by the military to communication with submarines low frequency waves can also occasionally travel long distances by reflecting from the ionosphere ( the actual mechanism is one of refraction ) , although this method , called skywave or '' skip '' propagation , is not as common as at higher frequencies for example : wwvb in colorado , united states , on 60 & nbsp ; khz dcf77 in frankfurt , germany , on 77.5 & nbsp ; khz jjy in japan , on 40 & 60 & nbsp ; khz 66.66 & nbsp ; khz in taldom transmitter , russia bpc in lintong , china , 68.5 & nbsp ; khz msf time and 60 & nbsp ; khz frequency standard transmitted from anthorn in the uk they use long-wave , rather than shortwave or mediumwave , because long-wave signals from the transmitter to the receiver always travel along the same direct path across the surface of the earth , so the time delay correction for the signal travel time from the transmitting station to the receiver is always the same for any one receiving location the delay between when the long-wave signal was sent from the transmitter ( when the coded time was correct ) and when the signal is received by the clock ( when the coded time is slightly late ) depends on the overland distance between the clock and the transmitter and the speed of light in a medium , which is also very nearly constant may transmit on the newly-allocated 2200-meter band from 136–139 & nbsp ; khz at maximum equivalent power radiated from the antenna of 1 & nbsp ; watt ( eirp ) ; most nations in europe already have adopted the new band , along with many others worldwide in north america during the 1970s , the frequencies 167 , 179 , and 191 & nbsp ; khz were assigned to the short-lived public emergency radio of the united states nowadays , in the united states , part 15 of fcc regulations allow unlicensed use of the 160–190 & nbsp ; khz band a transmitter / amplifier output power to the antenna of at most 1 & nbsp ; watt , with an antenna at most 15 & nbsp ; meters ( 49 & nbsp ; feet ) high ; this is called lowfer ( lowfer ) frequencies from 472–479 & nbsp ; khz are available to licensed amateurs as the new 630-meter band , part of the now-defunct 500 khz , but this is often considered a medium wave sub-band
