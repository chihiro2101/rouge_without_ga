to use the grandest word – art '' they are frequently deployed in works where the line between fantasy and reality becomes blurred , often as a result of the influence of popular culture ( willie , the wild west obsessive played by hywel bennett in where the buffalo roam ) or from a character 's apparent awareness of their status as a pawn in the hands of an omniscient author ( the actor jack black ( denholm elliott ) in follow the yellow brick road first broadcast in 1972 ) following in this spirit of non-naturalism , potter 's characters are frequently '' doubled up '' ; either by doppelgänger ( kika markham as both the actress and the escort in double dare ; norman rossington as lorenzo the gaoler and the english traveller in casanova ) or two different actors whose characters ' destinies and personalities appear interlinked ( bob hoskins and kenneth colley as arthur and the accordion man in pennies from heaven ; rufus ( christian rodska ) and gina the bear in a beast with two backs ) in plays where this occurs , the outsider will commit some apparently liberating act of evil michael billington and dennis potter '' dennis potter : there is a nostalgic , rightwing

unsublimated desires of the characters in that setting in potter on potter , published as part of faber and faber 's series on auteurs , potter told editor graham fuller that all forms of betrayal presented in literature are essentially religious and based on fall of man ; this is evoked in a number of works , from the use of popular songs in pennies from heaven to potter 's gnostic retelling of jesus ' final days in son of man these include the extensive use of flashback and nonlinear plot structure ( casanova ; late call ) , breaking the fourth wall ( vote , vote , vote for nigel barton ) and works where '' the child is father to the man '' , in which he used adult actors to play children ( stand up , nigel barton ; blue remembered hills ) on 15 march 1994 , three months before his death , potter gave an interview to melvyn bragg , later broadcast on 5 april 1994 by channel 4 ( he had broken most of his ties with the bbc as a result of his disenchantment with directors-general michael checkland and especially john birt , whom he had referred to as a '' croak-voiced dalek '' ) he referred in his 1998 diaries to a television programme '' that took potter at his own self-evaluation ( always high ) , when there was a good deal of indifferent stuff which was skated over '' , and believed that potter 's health was a factor in his fame , saying '' he visibly conformed to what the public thinks artists ought to be—poor or promiscuous , suffering or starved '' bbc four marked the tenth anniversary of potter 's death in december 2004 with a major series of documentaries about his life and work , accompanied by showings of pennies from heaven and the singing detective , as well as several of his single plays—many of which had not been shown since their initial broadcast '' alain resnais , same old song ( 1997 ) was dedicated to the memory of dennis potter and was in the style of potter 's '' lip-sync musicals '' pennies from heaven , the singing detective and lipstick on your collar and peter bowker controversy also dogged another play , brimstone and treacle ( play for today , 1976 ) , the original version of which was not screened by the bbc for over a decade owing to the depiction of the rape of a disabled woman by a man who is implied to be the devil incarnate the singing detective ( 1986 ) , featuring michael gambon , used the dramatist 's own problems with the skin disease psoriasis , for potter an often debilitating condition leading to hospital admission , as a means to merge the lead character 's imagination with his perception of reality the 'lip-sync ' technique he developed for his '' serials with songs '' ( pennies from heaven ; the singing detective and lipstick on your collar ) is perhaps the best known of the potter trademarks potter is known to have written adaptations of the phantom of the opera , the mystery of edwin drood , the white hotel and his earlier television play double dare ( 1976 ) : all

play ) brimstone and treacle , is included in the dvd set of the dramatist 's work for london weekend television although potter won few awards , he is held in high regard by many within the television and film industry , and was an influence on such creators as mark frost , steven bochco , bochco 's musical drama cop rock ( 1990 ) was inspired by the singing detective from the sixth form of st clement danes school , a grammar school in hammersmith , ( since demolished ) , he won a state scholarship to new college , oxford , arena , dennis potter where he studied philosophy , politics and economics potter 's chosen topic was what he perceived to be a contamination of news media and its effect on declining standards in british television '' particularly journalists who criticised his channel 4 series lipstick on your collar '' , kelvin mackenzie '' the sharp little oaf who edits the sun '' and garry bushell '' that sub-literate homophobic , sniggering rictus of a lout '' most of his secondary education however , was in london , and it was in a street near hammersmith broadway that the ten-year-old potter was sexually abused by his uncle , an experience he would later allude to many times in his writing blue remembered hills , directed by brian gibson and first shown by the bbc on 30 january 1979 , uses the dramatic device of adult actors playing children ,

suez crisis of 1956 like the much earlier lay down your arms ( 1970 ) , elements of which it recycled , this six-parter did not become a popular success and in it potter returned to use of lip-synched musical numbers in the manner of pennies from heaven potter 's career as a television playwright began with the confidence course ( the wednesday play , 1965 ) which potter had begun as a novel the serial was told using a non-linear narrative structure and , as the critic graham fuller noted in potter on potter , '' as chamber-piece and identity quest , casanova strongly anticipates later works such as the singing detective this concept forms the core of potter 's next two novels , and portions of hide and seek would reappear in several of his television plays , especially follow the yellow brick road ( 1972 ) and the singing detective sergio angelini '' stand up , nigel barton ( 1965 ) '' , bfi screenonline the second play features the same character standing as a labour candidate—his disillusionment with the compromises of electoral politics is based on potter 's own experience these included the nigel barton plays , a beast with two backs , follow the yellow brick road , son of

highway ( 1969 ) in potter on potter , the writer told graham fuller that he assumed casanova 's drive to seduce so many women was symptomatic of tristitia post coitum ( literally , '' the sadness after sex '' ) the play text for blue remembered hills was first published in the collection waiting for the boat ( with joe 's ark and blade on the feather ) in 1984 and has since enjoyed several successful stage performances the critical backlash against potter following blackeyes led to potter being labelled 'dirty den ' ( after den watts , the eastenders character ) by the british tabloid press , and resulted in a period of reclusion from television they lived a '' surprisingly quiet private life '' at ross-on-wye , herefordshire , and had a son , robert and two daughters , jane and sarah , who was to achieve prominence in the 1980s as an international cricketer telling bragg that he had two works he intended to finish ( '' my only regret is if i die four pages too soon '' ) , he proposed that these works , karaoke and cold lazarus , should be made with the rival bbc and channel 4 working in collaboration , a suggestion which was accepted as well as being an intensely personal play for potter , it was his first foray in the use of popular music to heighten the dramatic tension in his work following christabel ( 1988 ) , potter 's adaptation of the memoirs of christabel bielenberg , his next tv serial , blackeyes ( 1989 ) was a major disappointment in his career although potter only produced one play exclusively for theatrical performance ( sufficient carbohydrate , 1983 – later filmed for television as visitors in 1987 ) , he adapted several of his television works for the stage
