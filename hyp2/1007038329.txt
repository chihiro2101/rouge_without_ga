the general structure of the roman rite catholic service of vespers is as follows : vespers opens with the singing or chanting of the words deus , in adiutorium meum intende ) the appointed hymn ( from the hymnarium ) is then sung ; the appointed psalmody is then sung : in the liturgy in general use since 1970 there are two psalms and a new testament canticle , while in the divine office , older forms of the roman rite , five psalms are sung instead ( not quite the same five before and after the reform of the roman breviary by pope pius x ) the preces ( intercessory prayers ) are then said ( in the post-1970 roman rite ) , followed by the our father , and then the closing prayer ( oratio ) and final blessing/invocation great vespers is used on sundays and major feast days ( those when the polyeleos is prescribed at matins ) when it may be celebrated alone or as part of an all-night vigil , as well as on a handful of special days e.g small vespers is a very abbreviated form used only on the afternoon before a vigil and is redundant to the subsequent great vespers , being a placeholder between the ninth hour and compline and is seldom used except in monasteries , where the vigil can last all night the general structure of the service is as follows ( psalm numbers are according to the septuagint ) : vespers opens with a blessing by the priest and then '' come , let us worship '' ; when part of an all-night vigil , the blessing that normally begins matins is used ; when part of the divine liturgy , the blessing that is part thereof is used '' lord i have cried '' ( psalms 140 ( 141 ) , 141 ( 142 ) , 129 ( 130 ) , and 116 ( 117 ) ) is chanted in the tone of the week the clergy and the cantors will process to the back of the church in front of an icon of the feast or saint being commemorated after the cantors chant hymns pertaining to the feast , the deacon or priest will read a litany with several long petitions , to which the cantors respond with kyrie eleison ( '' lord , have mercy '' ) many times on major feast days , the artoklasia is performed , at which the priest will bless artos of bread which have been prepared in the center of the church , together with wheat , wine and oil , christmas eve , the annunciation when it falls on a weekday of great lent , or holy saturday , vespers is joined to the divine liturgy , functioning in place of the typica as the framework of the hymns of the liturgy of the catechumens after the readings from the old testament , the trisagion is chanted , followed by the epistle and gospel , and the divine liturgy proceeds normally from that point on these occasions , as at other times when the gospel is read at vespers , the little entrance is made with the gospel book instead of the censer the liturgy of the presanctified gifts always is similarly combined with vespers , with the first half of vespers ( up to and including the old testament readings ) making up a significant portion of the service vespers are known by the aramaic or syriac term ramsha in the east syriac liturgy which was used historically in the church of the east and remains in use in churches descended from it , namely the assyrian church of the east , the ancient church of the east , the chaldean catholic church , and the syro-malabar catholic church the office of vespers armenian երեգոյին ժամ eregoyin zham commemorates the hour when “ the son of god descended from the cross , and was wrapped in the winding sheet , and laid in the tomb ” vespers is the only service in the armenian daily office other than the morning service which has hymns proper to the commemoration , feast , or tone assigned to it : a vespers hymn after psalm 142 ( or after gladsome light if it is appointed for the day ) and the “ lifting-up hymn ” after psalm 121 in the coptic orthodox church , vespers refers to a series of services : the vespers prayer - this is taken from the book of hours the vespers raising of incense vespers , as a whole , is an introduction and preparation for the liturgy , consisting of a collection of prayers , praises and thanksgiving prayers which request the lord 's blessings upon the sacramental service the rite of vespers praises in the coptic orthodox church is as follows : the hymn ⲛⲓⲉⲑⲛⲟⲥ ⲧⲏⲣⲟⲩ ( psalm 116 ) the fourth canticle ( psalms 148 , 149 , 150 ) the psali for the day ( each day of the week has its own psali ) the theotokion for the day ( each day of the week has its own theotokion ) the lobsh or explanation of the theotokion the reading of the antiphonary on sunday , monday and tuesday : the conclusion of the adam theotokia on wednesday , friday , saturday , sunday : the conclusion of the batos theotokia ⲥⲱⲑⲓⲥ ⲁⲙⲏⲛ ( saved amen ) the lord 's prayer the rite of vespers raising of incense in the coptic orthodox church is as follows : the thanksgiving prayer - as with all coptic orthodox services , vespers first thanks god '' for everything , concerning everything , and in everything '' minor circuit of incense and three inaudible litanies the verses of the cymbals the litany for the departed major circuit of incense graciously accord o lord the trisagion the doxologies - commemorating the saints of the church and the liturgical season of the church the creed the prayer of ⲫⲛⲟⲩϯ ⲛⲁⲓ ⲛⲁⲛ ( o god have mercy upon us in the indian orthodox church , vespers ( ramsho ) is one of the canonical hours given in the shehimo the liturgy of the liberal catholic church daily office books that conform to the historic structure of vespers have also been published by the pilgrim press ( the new century hymnal ) and westminster john knox press ( book of common worship daily prayer ) from its traditional usage , the term vespers has come to be used more broadly for various evening services of other churches , some of which model their evening services on the traditional roman catholic form presbyterians and methodists , as well as congregationalist religious bodies such as unitarian universalism , often include congregational singing , readings , and a period of silent meditation , contemplation , or prayer some regular community vespers services are completely areligious ( or at least are not sponsored by any church ) and serve simply as a time for quiet contemplation in the evening hours in addition , during the 19th and early 20th centuries , synagogues in the classical reform tradition sometimes referred to their friday evening worship services as '' vespers '' from the time of the early church , the practice of fixed prayer times have been taught ; in apostolic tradition , hippolytus instructed christians to pray seven times a day '' on rising , at the lighting of the evening lamp , at bedtime , at midnight '' and '' the third , sixth and ninth hours of the day , being hours associated with christ 's passion the author states that this office took place at the tenth hour ( four o'clock in the evening ) ; it is really the office des lumières , i.e of the lights ; it was celebrated in the church of the holy sepulchre ; all the lamps and torches of the church were lighted , making , as the author says , '' an infinite light '' in the '' antiphonary of bangor '' , an irish document of the 6th century , vespers are called hora duodecima , which corresponds to six o'clock in the evening , or hora incensi , or again ad cereum benedicendum vespers , then , was the most solemn office of the day and was composed of the psalms called lucernales ( psalm 140 is called psalmus lucernalis by the apostolic constitutions ) it may thus be seen that the lucernarium was , together with vigil , the most important part of the offices of the day , being composed of almost the same elements as the latter , at least in certain regions in the sixth century the office of vespers in the latin church was almost the same as it has been throughout the middle ages and up to the present day in a document of unquestionable authority of that period the office is described as follows : the evening hour , or vespertina synaxis , is composed of four psalms , a capitulum , a response , a hymn , a versicle , a canticle from the gospel , litany ( kyrie ) , pater with the ordinary finale , oratio , or prayer , and dismissal ( rule of st the hymn is a more recent introduction in the roman vespers ; the finale ( litanies , pater , versicles , prayers ) seems all to have existed from this epoch as in the benedictine cursus like the other hours , therefore , vespers is divided into two parts ; the psalmody , or singing of the psalms , forming the first part , and the capitulum and formulæ the second as a matter of fact it was no longer the evening hour , but the sunset hour , so that it was celebrated before the day had departed and consequently before there was any necessity for artificial light ( regula s the reason of this is that st benedict introduced in the cursus , another hour—that of compline—which was prescribed to be celebrated in the evening , and which might be considered as a kind of doubling of the office of lucernarium as has already been remarked , the institution of the office of compline transformed the lucernarium by taking from it something of its importance and symbolism , the latter at the same time losing its original sense the eastern orthodox church retains the '' lumen hilare '' and some other traces of the ancient lucernarium in the offices of vespers and compline ( cf these psalms are to be recited with their antiphons , not only at the office de tempore ( sundays and feria ) but also on feasts of a lesser rite than doubles of the second class , that is to say , on simples , semidoubles ( double minors ) , and double majors on feasts which are doubles of the second class and a fortiori of the first class , as well as on feasts of the blessed virgin mary , the holy angels , and apostles , the psalms are proper to the feast as heretofore on all feasts , of whatever rite , the second part of vespers , that is , the capitulum , hymn , antiphon of the '' magnificat '' , is taken from the sanctorale on semi-doubles and those of a lesser rite the suffrages are now reduced to a single antiphon and orison which is common to all the saints heretofore commemorated , whilst the preces ( '' psalm 51 '' and versicles ) formerly imposed on the greater feriæ are now suppressed the office of vespers in general use before 1970 continues to be used today by those adhering to the roman rite as in 1962 or to earlier versions in the same manner as the night is consecrated to god by the office of the vigil , so also is the end of the day by vespers it terminates , as matins formerly terminated , and lauds at present terminates , by a lection , or reading , from the gospel , or canticum evangelii , which , for vespers , is always the '' magnificat '' this is one of the characteristic traits of vespers , one of the liturgical elements which this particular office has retained in almost all regions and at all times this place of honour accorded so persistently to the magnificat from such remote antiquity is but one of the many , and of the least striking , proofs of the devotion which has always been paid to the blessed virgin mary in the church the series of hymns consecrated to vespers in the roman breviary also form a class apart and help to give us some hints as to the symbolism of this hour they have this particular characteristic—they are all devoted to the praise of one of the days of the creation , according to the day of the week , thus : the first , '' lucis creator optime '' , on sunday , to the creation of light ; the second , on monday , to the separation of the earth and the waters ; the third , on tuesday , to the creation of the plants ; the fourth , on wednesday , to the creation of the sun and moon ; the fifth , on thursday , to the creation of the fish ; the sixth , on friday , to the creation of the beasts of the earth ; saturday is an exception , the hymn on that day being in honour of the blessed trinity , because of the office of sunday then commencing solemn vespers differ in that the celebrant wears the cope , he is assisted by assistants also in copes , incense is used , and two acolytes , a thurifer , and at least one master of ceremonies are needed the assistants sit on benches or stools facing the altar , or if there are two assistants , they may sit at the sedile next to the celebrant ( the first assistant in the place of the deacon and the second assistant in place of the subdeacon ) the celebrant and the first two assistants go to altar , and the altar is then incensed as at mass while the first two assistants hold
