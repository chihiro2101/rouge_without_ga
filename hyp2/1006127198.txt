attempts to isolate a global trait of '' suggestibility '' have not been successful , due to an inability of the available testing procedures to distinguish measurable differences between the following distinct types of '' suggestibility '' : to be affected by a communication or expectation such that certain responses are overtly enacted , or subjectively experienced , without volition , as in automatism it has been shown to have a great effect on the accuracy of a child 's recollection of an event , and eventually , the misinformation will be included in the child 's account of a given event what has not been agreed on is whether suggestibility is : a permanent fixed detail of character or personality ; a genetic or chemical psychiatric tendency ; a precursor to or symptom of an activation of such a tendency ; a learned skill or acquired habit ; synonymous with the function of learning ; a neutral , unavoidable consequence of language acquisition and empathy ; a biased terminology provoking one to resist new externally introduced ideas or perspectives ; a mutual symbiotic relation to the other , such as the african conception of ubunthu or ubuntu ; related to the capacity of empathy and communication ; a matter of concordant personal taste between speaker / hypnotist and listener and listener 's like of / use for speaker 's ideas ; a skill or a flaw or something neutral and universal some therapists may examine worries or objections to suggestibility before proceeding with therapy : this is because some believe there is a rational or learned deliberate will to hold a belief , even in the case of more convincing new ideas , when there is a compelling cognitive reason not to 'allow oneself ' to be persuaded when anyone is absorbed in someone else 's inspiring words as they outline an idea or way of thinking , the subjective attention is held because of the logic , the aesthetic , and the relevance of the words to one 's own personal experience and motivations existing research into the phenomena of hypnosis is extensive and randomized controlled trials predominantly support the efficacy and legitimacy of hypnotherapy , but without a clearly defined concept of the entity or aspect being studied , the level an individual is objectively '' suggestible '' can not be measured empirically that is , the depth of hypnosis a given individual can achieve in a given context with a particular hypnotherapist and particular set of beliefs , expectations and instructions the applications of hypnosis vary widely and investigation of responses to suggestion can be usefully separated into two non-exclusive broad divisions : experimental hypnosis : the study of '' experimental suggestion '' , of the form : : : '' what is it that my group of test subjects actually do when i deliver the precise standard suggestion abc to each of them in the same experimental context ? '' : : ( i.e john kappas ( 1925–2002 ) identified three different types of suggestibility in his lifetime that have improved hypnosis : emotional suggestibility – a suggestible behavior characterized by a high degree of responsiveness to inferred suggestions that affect emotions and restrict physical body responses ; usually associated with hypnoidal depth simple one-word forms of this include the word terrorism where to understand the concept , one must understand the notion of terror and then understand in the sentence that it is meant to refer to '' that '' given object however , suggestibility can also be seen in extremes , resulting in negative consequences : a witness ' testimony is altered because the police or attorneys make suggestions during the interview , which causes their already uncertain observations to become distorted memories according to some theoretical explanations of hypnotic responses , such as the role-playing theory of nicholas spanos , hypnotic subjects do not actually enter a different psychological or physiological state ; but , rather , simply acting on peer pressure – and , therefore , it is easier for them to comply than to disobey on this latter point , it must be pointed out that while some persuasion methods are more universally effective than others , the most reliably effective method with individuals is to personalize the approach by first examining their motivational , learning , behavioral and emotional styles ( et al a teacher could trick his ap psych students by saying , '' suggestibility is the distortion of memory through suggestion or misinformation , right ? '' it 's likely that the majority of the class would agree with him because he 's a teacher and what he said sounds correct , given a fixed suggestion , what is the outcome ? ) clinical hypnosis : the study of clinical suggestion directed at the question : : : '' what is it that i can possibly say to this particular subject , in this specific context , to generate my goal of having them do xyz ? '' ( i.e intellectual suggestibility – the type of hypnotic suggestibility in which a subject fears being controlled by the operator and is constantly trying to analyze , reject or rationalize everything the operator says when later asked about the '' huge fight '' that occurred , he recalls the memory , but unknowingly distorts it with exaggerated fabrications , because he now thinks of the event as a '' huge fight '' instead of a simple argument another example of research is that memory , suggestibility , stress arousal , and trauma-related psychopathology were examined in 328 3- to 16-year-olds involved in forensic investigations of abuse and neglect physical suggestibility – a suggestible behavior characterized by a high degree of responsiveness to literal suggestions affecting the body , and restriction of emotional responses ; usually associated with cataleptic stages or deeper wagstaff 's view is that , because '' a true response to a hypnotic suggestion is not a response brought about at any stage by volition , but rather a true non-volitional response , and perhaps even brought about despite volition '' , the first category really embodies the true domain of hypnotic suggestibility children , particularly younger children , are prone to including details that are similar yet unrelated to the specific event showing that the age of a person is critical in their susceptibility to influence little research has been carried out into the effects of anxious mood at the time of either the encoding of misleading post‐event information or the time of its possible retrieval , on subsequent suggestibility popular media and layman 's articles occasionally use the terms '' suggestible '' and '' susceptible '' interchangeably , with reference to the extent to which a given individual responds to incoming suggestions from another gist extraction : although children are extremely likely to recall false memory when past events are similar to a current event , they will also recall false memory details that are seemingly unrelated to the event a suggestion may direct the thoughts to notice a new concept , focus on a specific area within the world , offer new perspectives that later may influence action-choices , offer triggers for automatic behavior ( such as returning a smile ) , or indicate specific action types the problem as it relates to suggestibility is when children , and even adults , blend previous knowledge of similar experiences into their recollection of a single event
