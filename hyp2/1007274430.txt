the last serious commercial traffic on the canal was the carriage of bricks from walkeringham to west stockwith , which ended in 1955 , although there was a small trade in warp , a fine silt dredged from the trent at the mouth of the river idle , and used by the cutlery trade in sheffield for polishing metal , which lasted into the early 1960s the last few miles of the canal , from chesterfield to staveley , were in reasonable condition , although the towpath was overgrown and difficult to access , while much of the route was under threat from opencast coal mining and a planned bypass , which had first been proposed in 1927 the original route of the canal at hague lane was largely destroyed by the construction of the railway and renishaw central station , but further north , the section around chapel wheel forge and dam is still clearly visible , and reinstatement of it as part of a restored canal was considered but rejected on practical grounds it will not be possible to reopen the norwood tunnel , as several sections have collapsed , the national coal board filled in some sections to stabilise the land above it , and when the m1 motorway was built , the tunnel below it was injection grouted , to ensure there would not be a subsequent collapse the first bridge over the canal in this location was further to the east , and was erected in the 1850s , when the canal arm to speedwell colliery was filled in , to be converted to a railway the manchester , sheffield and lincolnshire railway was expanding , and an act of parliament was obtained in 1889 , which allowed them to divert parts of the canal to enable a new railway connecting chesterfield , staveley and beighton to be constructed the solution adopted to overcome this was the construction of a dropped pound , with a new staveley town lock ( 5a ) immediately to the north of staveley basin to lower the level of the canal , and railway lock ( 5b ) constructed just beyond the railway bridge whereas most of the work so far had involved restoration of the existing channel , this section includes some significant engineering challenges , with completely new construction needed to bypass the housing estate in killamarsh , built over the original line in the 1970s , and the replacement of norwood tunnel with an alternative route government policy changed following the publication of a white paper entitled british waterways : recreation and amenity in september 1967 , and the canal was classified as a cruiseway between the trent and morse lock , worksop under the transport act 1968 , meaning that it would be maintained to a navigable standard for leisure use the project involves the creation of a short length of new canal to create an island in the centre of the site , navigation being restored to a length of the river , and a new basin at the southern edge of the site however , parts of the channel had survived remarkably well in places , as it had been used to supply water to the iron industry , and maintained by a team with a boat until the 1950s the basin was completed and was opened in october 2009 , although it remains isolated from the river rother , to which it will be connected by a lock , while a back-pumping facility will supply it with water the chesterfield canal trust was formed in september 1976 , determined to restore the canal beyond worksop , and in 1977 they organised a boat rally at worksop to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the canal , in conjunction with the worksop and retford boat club this would provide a way to reach the chesterfield canal without negotiating the tidal river trent , and would create a new cruising ring , taking in the rother link , river don navigation , stainforth and keadby canal , river trent , and chesterfield canal the previous year , the sheffield & lincolnshire junction railway had been proposed , to build a line from sheffield to gainsborough , and was supported by the sheffield , ashton-under-lyne & manchester railway however , in practice progress had been slow , and attention turned to the section west of norwood tunnel , where much more damage had been done to the canal bed , with it being filled in and built over in many places the towpath of the canal has become a long-distance footpath and cycle route , stretching for from chesterfield to west stockwith , and is signposted as the '' cuckoo way '' after the name given to the boats which worked on the canal however , once the festival was over , a clay bund had been reinstated above the lock by 16 june , and the pound below it drained , in order to allow work to continue on the weir and spillway which carries excess water back to the river rother progress beyond worksop moved forwards rapidly in 1995 , when a derelict land grant was obtained by nottinghamshire county council , and with additional funding from british coal , a Â£4.5 million scheme began to restore the canal between worksop and the aqueduct over the river ryton which forms the county boundary however , by the time they announced this , the sheffield & lincolnshire junction railway had already become part of the manchester , sheffield and lincolnshire railway , and so they amalgamated with that company instead the act of parliament stated that although the canal company was to be dissolved , the entire canal was to be retained , its water supplies maintained , and tolls were to be fixed at a just level various attempts to reduce the growth of weed , which had first appeared on the canal in 1852 , were made , with variable success , and there was a brisk trade in munitions during the second world war now arguing from a position of strength , the manchester & lincoln union rescinded their plans for most of their lines , and obtained an act of parliament on 7 august 1846 allowing them to construct a line from the midland railway at staveley to the canal at worksop norwood tunnel was a , and , brick-lined canal tunnel on the line of the chesterfield canal with its western portal in norwood , derbyshire and its eastern portal in kiveton , south yorkshire responsibility for the canal passed the london and north eastern railway ( lner ) in 1923 , who carried out regular maintenance , and repaired and enlarged the lock connecting west stockwith basin to the river trent between 1923 and 1925 although a small section of it at the eastern end may be reused as part of the restoration , most of it will remain abandoned , as it has suffered from subsidence , and parts of it have been filled in the building , which is known as the hollingwood hub , was funded by a grant from community assets , part of the government 's office for civil society , and provides offices for the trust , a meeting room and a coffee shop funding for the basin was provided by derbyshire county council with a grant from the east midlands development agency , and the work which included the reclamation of the surrounding land , won an award from the institute of civil engineers , given jointly to derbyshire and the contractors nt killingley with the canal open from west stockwith to the eastern portal of norwood tunnel , and from chesterfield to staveley , there were less than left to be restored by 2017 drakeholes tunnel is a second , shorter tunnel 154 yards long also without a towpath built for the chesterfield canal at drakeholes ,
