193–205 originally he worked for odo of bayeux , but he soon entered the chancery of king william i , odo 's half-brother 150–151 his nickname , flambard , means torch-bearer , incendiary or devouring flame ; and may have been given to him for his high-spirited personality 75 orderic vitalis , a medieval chronicler , records that robert despenser gave the nickname to ranulf , because robert resented the fact that ranulf , though of low birth , ordered the nobility around before the death of the old king he became chaplain to maurice , bishop of london , whom he had formerly served in the chancery 133 although he served william the conqueror , he does not attest a single genuine charter or writ of william 's , which implies he was not a leading servant mason '' flambard , ranulf ''

of the royal scriptorium one of his new measures in revenue collection came in 1094 , when the fyrd , or english militia , was assembled to fight in normandy against the king 's brother robert curthose 63 another innovation was the attempt to collect a relief , much like the relief due from vassals at the death of an overlord , from the under-tenants of church lands when the church office changed hands 612–613 this attempt came at the death of wulfstan , bishop of worcester in 1095 , when the king sent writs to the free tenants of the bishop , setting the amount of relief owed to the king 381 eventually he obtained the wealthy see of durham for himself in may 1099 , being consecrated on 5 june 1099 407 he was given ecclesiastical jurisdiction over carlisle and cumbria , because his predecessors had done so as bishops of lindisfarne , but he only exercised this for a short time , as after the accession of henry i jurisdiction over these areas was transferred to the diocese of york 124 it has been suggested that ranulf may have been the first justiciar of all england ( or chief justiciar ) , barlow william rufus p 159 he ran the government of england while rufus was fighting in normandy , not only raising money , but issuing writs and judging court cases 83 william of malmesbury in describing ranulf 's financial efforts said that he '' skinned the rich , ground the down the poor , and swept other men 's inheritances into his net 125–123 another medieval chronicler , orderic vitalis , said that ranulf planned to revise the survey of england , almost certainly

and restored to his bishopric , but he chose to stay with robert for five more years hollister , see the treaty as mainly ranulf 's work , as mainly an attempt to salvage his ecclesiastical career in england , along with a displacement of ranulf from being the chief councillor of curthose to merely being one of many 327 robert rewarded ranulf for his advice during the invasion by entrusting him with the administration of the see of lisieux 269 after robert 's defeat by henry at tinchebray in 1106 , the bishop was among the first to make his peace with henry , and returned to durham although some historians have theorised that ranulf 's time in normandy was as an agent of henry , it appears that ranulf was mainly looking out for his own interests and those of his family 347–348 thurgot had been prior of the cathedral chapter at durham , but had disagreed with ranulf , who arranged for him to be elected to st andrew 's as a solution to the quarrel 629 it was ranulf who ordained thurstan , the archbishop-elect of york , as a priest in 1115 , although thurstan had to wait for consecration as bishop for another four years medieval chroniclers told the story that the legate was much taken with ranulf 's niece , and after sleeping with the girl , took no action on the charges against ranulf 260 the first stone bridge at durham was completed by his instruction in 1120 , the so-called framwellgate bridge , a bridge described as '' of wonderful workmanship 174–175 while the chroniclers mainly condemned ranulf for his morals , his own cathedral chapter held him in high esteem because of his building activities and his defence of the rights of durham 71 although he usurped some of the income of the cathedral chapter , the money from those rights was used to complete the cathedral rebuilding , and later restored the income to the monks as well as increasing the endowment fulcher may have been appointed bishop to enable ranulf to exploit the see while ranulf was in exile in normandy 354 when ranulf became bishop , he married her to a burgess of huntingdon , but remained on good terms with both alveva and her spouse , often staying with them when he travelled away from durham 23 one of ranulf 's nephews , ralf , was archdeacon of northumberland and during the reign of king stephen helped to hold the diocese of durham loyal to stephen unrelated to ranulf , william of corbeil became one of ranulf 's household clerks , and was eventually to be elected archbishop of canterbury in 1123 while he was efficient in collecting the royal revenues , he was

own adherents , but rapacious in seizing the goods of other men '' besides the chroniclers , archbishop anselm of canterbury wrote to pope paschal ii , while ranulf was in exile , describing ranulf as '' a rent collector of the worst possible reputation
