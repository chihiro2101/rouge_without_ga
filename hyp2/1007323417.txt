'' howard posits that the work 's legacy is best understood as embodying the cultural zeitgeist of the jazz age : '' beginning with that incomparable , flamboyant clarinet solo , rhapsody is irresistible still , with its syncopated rhythmic vibrancy , its abandoned , impudent flair that tells more about the roaring twenties than could a thousand words , and its genuine melodic beauty colored a deep , jazzy blue by the flatted sevenths and thirds that had their origins in the african-american slave songs '' although gershwin 's rhapsody '' was by no means a definitive example of jazz in the jazz age , '' music historians such as james ciment and floyd levin have similarly concurred that it is the key composition that encapsulates the spirit of the era the use of so-called '' vernacular '' instruments , such as accordion , banjo , and saxophones in the orchestra , contribute to its jazz or popular style , and the latter two of these instruments have remained part of grofé 's '' standard '' orchestra scoring according to critic orrin howard of the los angeles philharmonic , gershwin 's rhapsody '' made an indelible mark on the history of american music , on the fraternity of serious composers and performers—many of whom were present at the premiere—and on gershwin himself , for its enthusiastic reception encouraged him to other and more serious projects '' accordingly , the composition was used in this context in a new york segment for the 1999 walt disney pictures animated film fantasia 2000 , in which the piece is used as the lyrical framing for a stylized animation set drawn in the style of famed illustrator al hirschfeld '' likewise , music historian vince giordano has opined that '' the syncopation , the blue notes , the ragtime and jazz rhythms that gershwin wrote in 1924 was really a feeling of new york city in that amazing era accordingly , rhapsody in blue was used as a dramatic leitmotif for the character of jay gatsby in the 2013 film the great gatsby , a cinematic adaptation of fitzgerald 's 1925 novel the opening modulates '' downward '' , as it were , through the keys b , e , a , d , g , b , e , and finally to a major stride piano 's rhythmic and improvisational style is evident in the '' agitato e misterioso '' section , which begins four bars after rehearsal 33 , as well as in other sections , many of which include the orchestra various writers , such as american playwright terry teachout , have also likened gershwin himself to the character of gatsby due to his attempt to transcend his lower-class background , his abrupt meteoric success , and his early death while in his thirties two of the remaining three themes are rhythmically related to the very first theme in measure 2 , which is sometimes called the glissando theme—after the opening glissando in the clarinet solo—or the ritornello theme rhapsody in blue also inspired a collaboration between blind savant british pianist derek paravicini and composer matthew king on a new concerto , called blue premiered at the south bank centre in london in 2011 the clearest influence of jazz is the use of blue notes , and the exploration of their half-step relationship plays a key role in the rhapsody the gershwin family , working in conjunction with the library of congress and the university of michigan , are working to make these scores available to the public
