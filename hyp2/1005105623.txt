over the next three centuries countless vessels ( merchant ships and warships , fast and slow , in peace and war ) crossed back and forth over the north atlantic , all subject to the vagaries of wind and weather it was the advent of the steam ship , with its independence from wind power , which offered the possibility of regular , scheduled atlantic crossings , in periods of two to three weeks , that opened a new era of transatlantic travel and competition the term '' blue riband of the atlantic '' did not come into use until the 1890s , and the history of the trans-atlantic competition , which was compiled retrospectively , was regarded as starting with the crossings by the steamships sirius and great western in 1838 although not the first steamships to cross the atlantic ( savannah had crossed in 1819 , and royal william in 1831 ) nor the fastest to make the crossing ( the packet sailing ship columbia crossed west to east in 15 days 23 hours in 1830 , and crossings by sail packets of 16 and 17 days were not unheard of ) the sirius and great western were the first steamships offering a regular , scheduled trans-atlantic service ; and crucially , they were involved in a race about the same time , the question of atlantic steamships was discussed at an 1835 director 's meeting of the newly formed great western railway when the line 's chief engineer , isambard kingdom brunel supposedly joked that the line could be made longer by building a steamship to run between bristol and new york with her westbound crossing at 8.03 knots ( 14.87 km/h ) , sirius is often considered the first record holder even though the notion would not be used for several generations the cunard line started its liverpool-halifax-boston service in 1840 with the four ships that were slightly reduced versions of great western with about the same speed by 1846 , cunard was the only original steamship line that survived , largely because of its subsidy from the british admiralty to carry the mails and its emphasis on safety the next year , cunard put further pressure on collins by commissioning its first iron-hulled paddler , the persia , which set a new record with a 9-day , 16-hour liverpool-new york voyage at scotia was the final significant paddler ordered for the atlantic because under the terms of cunard 's mail contract with the admiralty , it was still required to supply paddle steamers when needed for military service during the five-year panic of 1873 that began in 1873 , william pearce , the controlling partner of the john elder shipyard , became convinced that a crack steamer that carried only passengers and light freight could be profitable because she would attract more passengers and spend less time in port white star , which had not built an express liner since the of 1875 , commissioned the record-breaker , of 1889 and of 1890 after receiving a subsidy from the admiralty to make the pair available as merchant cruisers in the event of hostilities in 1898 , the raised the record to , while the other liner , kaiser friedrich failed to achieve her contract speed and was returned to her builders british prestige was at stake , and the government provided cunard with an annual subsidy of £150,000 plus a low interest loan of £2.5 & nbsp ; million to pay for the construction of the two superliners , lusitania and mauretania under the condition that they be available for conversion to armed cruisers when needed by the navy in 1928 , as britain 's response to the german and , the white star line ordered a new diesel-electric 1000-ft long ocean liner to be named oceanic capable of 200,000 shp the next year , cunard started construction on an 80,000 ton liner that was to be the first of two record breakers fast enough to fit into a two ship weekly southampton-new york service therefore , the government agreed to give cunard a loan of £3 & nbsp ; million to complete hull 534 as the and an additional £5 & nbsp ; million to build a second ship , the only if cunard merged with white star the two liners were operated as a pair and traded the blue riband again , with the cunard white star liner ultimately posting in 1938 in 1935 , harold hales ( 1868–1942 ) , a member of the uk parliament and owner of a shipping company , commissioned hales trophy to be presented to the fastest ship crossing the atlantic , in order to formalize the rules surrounding the trans atlantic competition the rules for the trophy did not correspond to the traditional rules for the blue riband in that the trophy was to be awarded only to surface passenger ship achieving the fastest speed in the westbound direction other rule changes further complicated the situation , and eventually the trophy was awarded to just three blue riband holders ; rex , in 1935 , normandie in 1936 , and united states in 1952 however , the united states government was impressed by the large numbers of troops carried by the queens during the war , and ordered a superliner that was as much a troop carrier as an express liner there was a growing recognition that the era of fast crossings by express liners was becoming a thing of the past , and that the contest for fast transatlantic travel was shifting to the air in the 1930s , air travel was already competing with the express liners for fast atlantic crossings ; in 1936 , the german company delag commenced an airship service to new york , their hindenburg crossing from europe to america in times ranging from 53 to 78 hours , and the following year , while experimenting with a flying boat service , empire airways caledonia reduced this to 15 hours the final step in the quest for trans-atlantic speed was the bac concorde , which set a record in 1996 of a second under two hours 53 minutes , at an average speed of 1250 & nbsp ; mph ( mach 1.9 ) , but by this time airlines were aware that cost and comfort were more important to passengers than speed , and the emphasis shifted to aircraft like the boeing 747 , with a sleeper capacity for business passengers however , as virgin atlantic challenger was not a passenger vessel the new york maritime museum refused to part with the hales trophy , so branson inaugurated the virgin atlantic challenge trophy , for the fastest unqualified atlantic crossing , open to all challengers meanwhile , incat , builders of fast catamaran ferries , and therefore indisputably commercial vessels , decided to make an attempt to win the hales trophy , for which the record was still that of united states this was achieved in 1990 by hoverspeed great britain , with a non-stop crossing of 79 hours 54 minutes , averaging 36.6 knots and incat were awarded the trophy by the hales trophy committee the ocean rowing society inspired by the blue riband concept created blue riband trophy of ocean rowing awarded to the fastest crew to cross the atlantic ocean in an unsupported row boat with the end of the express liners era , the blue riband has become an item of largely historical interest , with some authors regarding the united states as the last holder of the accolade therefore , most lists feature sirius , in her race with great western in 1838 , as the first record-holder , although her crossing was not as fast as some sail packet ships of the period vernon gibbs ( 1952 ) , and noel bonsor ( 1975 ) added to the body of knowledge , with additional detail about the german ships provided by arnold kludas for example , gibbs credits inman 's city of paris with an 1866 blue riband voyage , and cunard 's russia with an eastbound record the following year because he considered as dubious scotia 's blue riband claim of , supposedly based on a very long track
