the phospholipid bilayer that forms the cell surface membrane consists of a hydrophobic inner core region sandwiched between two regions of hydrophilicity , one at the inner surface and one at the outer surface of the cell membrane ( see lipid bilayer article for a more detailed structural description of the cell membrane ) the inner and outer surfaces , or interfacial regions , of model phospholipid bilayers have been shown to have a thickness of around 8 to 10 å , although this may be wider in biological membranes that include large amounts of gangliosides or lipopolysaccharides binding of a protein to a specific lipid occurs via specific membrane-targeting structural domains that occur within the protein and have specific binding pockets for the lipid head groups of the lipids to which they bind peripheral enzymes participate in metabolism of different membrane components , such as lipids ( phospholipases and cholesterol oxidases ) , cell wall oligosaccharides ( glycosyltransferase and transglycosidases ) , or proteins ( signal peptidase and palmitoyl protein thioesterases ) protein association with membranes through the use of acylated residues is a reversible process , as the acyl chain can be buried in a protein 's hydrophobic binding pocket after dissociation from the membrane orientations and penetration depths of many amphitropic proteins and peptides in membranes are studied using site-directed spin labeling , chemical labeling , measurement of membrane binding affinities of protein mutants , fluorescence spectroscopy , solution or solid-state nmr spectroscopy , atr ftir spectroscopy , x-ray or neutron diffraction , and computational methods hydrophobic interactions have been shown to be important even for highly cationic peptides and proteins , such as the polybasic domain of the marcks protein or histactophilin , when their natural hydrophobic anchors are present it has been shown that the membrane binding affinities of many peripheral proteins depend on the specific lipid composition of the membrane with which they are associated intrinsically unstructured or unfolded peptides with nonpolar residues or lipid anchors can also penetrate the interfacial region of the membrane and reach the hydrocarbon core , especially when such peptides are cationic and interact with negatively charged membranes such complexes are also stabilized by the formation of ionic bridges between the aspartate or glutamate residues of the protein and lipid phosphates via intervening calcium ions ( ca 2+ ) the boundary region between the hydrophobic inner core and the hydrophilic interfacial regions is very narrow , at around 3å , ( see lipid bilayer article for a description of its component chemical groups ) on the exoplasmic face of the cell membrane , lipid anchored proteins are covalently attached to the lipids glycosylphosphatidylinositol ( gpi ) and cholesterol these may include the folding of regions of protein structure that were previously unfolded typical amphitropic proteins must interact strongly with the lipid bilayer in order to perform their biological functions
