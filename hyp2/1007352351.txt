for instance , from a series of observations that a woman walks her dog by the market at 8 & nbsp ; am on monday , it seems valid to infer that next monday she will do the same , or that , in general , the woman walks her dog by the market every monday first of all , it is not certain , regardless of the number of observations , that the woman always walks by the market at 8 & nbsp ; am on monday in fact , david hume would even argue that we can not claim it is '' more probable '' , since this still requires the assumption that the past predicts the future what was hume 's contribution to the problem of induction ? the philosophical quarterly 45 ( 181 ) :460–470 that although sextus 's approach to the problem appears different , hume 's approach was actually an application of another argument raised by sextus : sextus empiricus 179 although the regress argument applies to both deduction and induction , weintraub believes that sextus 's argument '' is precisely the strategy hume invokes against induction : it can not be justified , because the purported justification , being inductive , is circular the cārvāka , a materialist and skeptic school of indian philosophy , used the problem of induction to point out the flaws in using inference as a way to gain valid knowledge they held that since inference needed an invariable connection between the middle term and the predicate , and further , that since there was no way to establish this invariable connection , that the efficacy of inference as a means of valid knowledge could never be stated pg 533 the 9th century indian skeptic , jayarāśi bhaṭṭa , also made an attack on inference , along with all means of knowledge , and showed by a type of reductio argument that there was no way to conclude universal relations from the observation of particular instances duns scotus , however , argued that inductive inference from a finite number of particulars to a universal generalization was justified by '' a proposition reposing in the soul , 'whatever occurs in a great many instances by a cause that is not free , is the natural effect of that cause from this discussion , hume goes onto present his formulation of the problem of induction in a treatise of human nature , writing '' there can be no demonstrative arguments to prove , that those instances , of which we have had no experience , resemble those , of which we have had experience '' in other words , the problem of induction can be framed in the following way : we can not apply a conclusion about a particular set of observations to a more general set of observations hume 's treatment of induction helps to establish the grounds for probability , as he writes in a treatise of human nature that '' probability is founded on the presumption of a resemblance betwixt those objects , of which we have had experience , and those , of which we have had none '' ( book i , part iii , section vi ) harvard university press , 1983 , p.74 , '' will each confirm the general hypothesis that all emeralds are grue '' goodman ’ s original definition of grue ) observed to be green before a certain time t , or blue if observed after that time the '' new '' problem of induction is , since all emeralds we have ever seen are both green and grue , why do we suppose that after time t we will find green but not grue emeralds ? the problem here raised is that two different inductions will be true and false under the same conditions in other words : given the observations of a lot of green emeralds , someone using a common language will inductively infer that all emeralds are green ( therefore , he will believe that any emerald he will ever find will be green , even after time t ) if we had always been brought up to think in terms of '' grue '' and '' bleen '' ( where bleen is blue before time t , or green thereafter ) , we would intuitively consider '' green '' to be a crazy and complicated predicate it is by custom or habit that one draws the inductive connection described above , and '' without the influence of custom we would be entirely ignorant of every matter of fact beyond what is immediately present to the memory and senses '' david stove 's argument for induction , based on the statistical syllogism , was presented in the rationality of induction and was developed from an argument put forward by one of stove 's heroes , the late donald cary williams ( formerly professor at harvard ) in his book the ground of induction , stove argued that it is a statistical truth that the great majority of the possible subsets of specified size ( as long as this size is not too small ) are similar to the larger population to which they belong for example , the majority of the subsets which contain 3000 ravens which you can form from the raven population are similar to the population itself ( and this applies no matter how large the raven population is , as long as it is not infinite ) consequently , stove argued that if you find yourself with such a subset then the chances are that this subset is one of the ones that are similar to the population , and so you are justified in concluding that it is likely that this subset '' matches '' the population reasonably closely according to popper , the problem of induction as usually conceived is asking the wrong question : it is asking how to justify theories given they can not be justified by induction popper regarded theories that have survived criticism as better corroborated in proportion to the amount and stringency of the criticism , but , in sharp contrast to the inductivist theories of knowledge , emphatically as less likely to be true science should seek for theories that are most probably false on the one hand ( which is the same as saying that they are highly falsifiable and so there are many ways that they could turn out to be wrong ) , but still all actual attempts to falsify them have failed so far ( that they are highly corroborated ) popperians would wish to choose well-corroborated theories , in their sense of corroboration , but face a dilemma : either they are making the essentially inductive claim that a theory 's having survived criticism in the past means it will be a reliable predictor in the future ; or popperian corroboration is no indicator of predictive power at all , so there is no rational motivation for their preferred selection principle the rational motivation for choosing a well-corroborated theory is that it is simply easier to falsify : well-corroborated means that at least one kind of experiment ( already conducted at least once ) could have falsified ( but did not actually falsify ) the one theory , while the same kind of experiment , regardless of its outcome , could not have falsified the other so it is rational to choose the well-corroborated theory : it may not be more likely to be true , but if it is actually false , it is easier to get rid of when confronted with the conflicting evidence that will eventually turn up accordingly , it is wrong to consider corroboration as a reason , a justification for believing in a theory or as an argument in favor of a theory to convince someone who objects to it
