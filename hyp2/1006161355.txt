as an alphabetic letter denoting a sibilant sound , sampi ( shaped , it was used on coins , which were marked with the abbreviation of the city 's name , spelled '' '' it is therefore believed that the local letter sampi was used to denote some kind of intermediate sound during the phonetic change from the earlier plosive clusters towards the later sound , possibly an affricate , forming a triplet with the greek letters for and the first known use of alphabetic sampi in writing native greek words is an inscription found on a silver plate in ephesus , which has the words '' '' ( '' four '' ) and '' '' ( '' forty '' ) spelled with sampi ( cf this is currently the first known instance of alphabetic sampi in miletus itself , commonly assumed to be the birthplace of the numeral system and thus of the later numeric use of sampi in the alphabetic numeral system , which was probably invented in miletus and is therefore sometimes called the '' milesian '' system , there are 27 numeral signs : the first nine letters of the alphabet , from alpha ( a ) to theta ( θ ) stand for the digits 1–9 ; the next nine , beginning with iota ( ι ) , stand for the multiples of ten ( 10 , 20 , etc from this , it has been concluded that the system must have been invented at a time and place when digamma and koppa were still either in use or at least still remembered as parts of the alphabetic sequence , whereas san had either already been forgotten , or at least was no longer remembered with its original alphabetic position according to threatte , the earliest known use of numeric sampi in a stone inscription occurs in an inscription in magnesia from the 2nd century bc , in a phrase denoting a sum of money ( '' , also known as syll³ 695.b earlier than the attestations in the full function as a numeral are a few instances where sampi was used in athens as a mark to enumerate sequences of things in a set , along with the 24 other letters of the alphabet , without implying a specific decimal numeral value for instance , there is a set of 25 metal tokens , each stamped with one of the letters from alpha to sampi , which are dated to the 4th century bc and were probably used as identification marks for judges in the courts of the athenian democracy at an early stage in the papyri , the numeral sampi was used not only for 900 , but , somewhat confusingly , also as a multiplicator for 1000 , since a way of marking thousands and their multiples was not yet otherwise provided by the alphabetic system in early stone inscriptions , the shape of sampi , both alphabetic and numeric , is , galen says that one of them '' looks like the way some people write the sign for 900 '' , and describes this as '' the shape of the letter π with a vertical line in the middle '' ( '' '' ) throughout the 19th and 20th centuries , many authors have assumed that sampi was essentially a historical continuation of the archaic letter san , the m-shaped alternative of sigma ( σ ) that formed part of the greek alphabet when it was originally adopted from phoenician the second reason for the assumption is the systematicity in the development of the letter inventory : there were three archaic letters that dropped out of use in alphabetic writing ( digamma , koppa , and san ) , and three extra-alphabetic letters were adopted for the milesian numeral system , two of them obviously identical with the archaic digamma and koppa ; hence , it is easy to assume that the third in the set had the same history the original emergence of the alphabet , the loss of archaic san , the emergence of alphabetic sampi , and the emergence of the numeral system ) have continued to affect the data base on which it is founded
