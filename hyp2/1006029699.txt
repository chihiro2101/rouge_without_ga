as of 1864 , holstein bordered denmark in the north , the principality of lübeck ( formerly the prince-bishopric of lübeck , an exclave of the grand duchy of oldenburg ) , the free city of lübeck , and the duchy of saxe-lauenburg in the east , and the kingdom of hanover and the free and hanseatic city of hamburg in the south in 1544 they partitioned the duchies of holstein ( a fief of the holy roman empire ) and of schleswig ( a danish fief ) in an unusual way , following negotiations between the brothers and the estates of the realm of the duchies , which had constituted in 1460 by the treaty of ribe and strictly opposed a factual partition holstein , meanwhile including former saxe-lauenburg ( as of 1876 ) and the former free city of lübeck and region of lübeck ( both as of 1937 ) regained statehood , now united with schleswig , in 1946 , when the british occupation government elevated the province to the schleswig-holstein , followed by the official dissolution of prussia in 1947 haderslev ducal share in holstein and schleswig , partitioned from ducal holstein in 1544 , halved between gottorp and royal share in 1581 royal share in holstein and schleswig , acquired half of haderslev share in 1581 , the county of holstein-pinneberg in 1640 and the gottorp share in 1713 ( northern part ) and 1773 ( southern part ) , thus then comprising all of holstein the new county of holstein was established in 1111 ; it was first a fief of the duchy of saxony , then of the duchy of saxe-lauenburg , and finally of the prince-bishopric of lübeck when the holstein-rendsburg line of the schauenburg counts became extinct with the death of adolf viii , count of holstein ( and in personal union as adolf i duke of schleswig ) in 1459 , christian i of denmark inherited – from his maternal uncle adolf i – the duchy of schleswig , a danish fief because of its personal union with denmark , the duchy of holstein did not come under french occupation during the napoleonic era ( however , the neighboring duchy of lauenburg was annexed by france in 1811 and became a part of bouches-de-l'elbe ) with the conquest of old saxony by charlemagne circa 800 , he granted the land north of the eider river ( schleswig ) to the danes by the treaty of heiligen signed in 811 similar to the above-mentioned agreement christian iii 's youngest son john the younger gained for him and his heirs a share in holstein 's and schleswig 's revenues in 1564 , comprising a third of the royal share , thus a ninth of holstein and schleswig as to the fiscal point of view so the revenues of the duchies were divided in three equal shares by assigning the revenues of particular areas and estate ( land ) to each of the elder brothers , while other general revenues , such as taxes from towns and customs dues , were levied together but then shared among the brothers the ownership of what would late become eastern holstein ( districts of plön and ostholstein ) was given to obotrites , namely the wagrians , and the saxon elite was deported to various areas of the empire the three shares are usually called : gottorp ducal share in holstein and schleswig , partitioned from ducal holstein in 1544 , acquired half of haderslev share in 1581 ( thus thereafter simply called ducal share ) , merged into the royal share in 1773 with its ruler receiving in return the prior danish-held county of oldenburg as an effect the complicated fiscal division of both separate duchies , holstein and schleswig , with shares of each party scattered in both duchies , provided them with a condominial government binding both together , partially superseding their legally different affiliation as holy roman and danish fiefs from 1815 to 1864 it was a member of the german confederation , though still in personal union with denmark ( the king of denmark being also duke of holstein ) the counts of schauenburg and holstein partitioned holstein several times among the inheriting sons into up to six lines , named after their towns of residence : holstein-itzehoe , branch county between 1261 and 1290 , partitioned from holstein , repartitioned into holstein-pinneberg , holstein-plön and holstein-rendsburg holstein-kiel , branch county between 1261 and 1390 , partitioned from holstein , in 1273 holstein-segeberg ( first ) was partitioned from holstein-kiel , but reverted in 1308 , but then lost to holstein-pinneberg , holstein-plön and holstein-rendsburg in 1316 ; holstein-kiel acquired holstein-plön in 1350 , and merged itself into holstein-rendsburg holstein-pinneberg , branch county between 1290 and 1640 , partitioned from holstein-itzehoe , acquired a share of holstein-segeberg in 1316 , merged into the duchy of holstein holstein-plön , branch county between 1290 and 1390 , partitioned from holstein-itzehoe , acquired a share of holstein-segeberg in 1316 , merged into holstein-kiel holstein-rendsburg , branch county between 1290 and 1474 , partitioned from holstein-itzehoe , acquired a share of holstein-segeberg ( first ) in 1316 , and holstein-kiel in 1390 , in 1381/1384 holstein-segeberg ( second ) was partitioned from holstein-rendsburg , but reverted in 1403 , elevated to ducal rank in 1474 holstein-segeberg ( first ) , branch county between 1273 and 1308 , partitioned from and reverted to holstein-kiel , but seized by allied holstein-pinneberg , holstein-plön , and holstein-rendsburg , partitioning segeberg in three shares , each merged into one of the lines in 1316 holstein-segeberg ( second ) , branch county between 1381/1384 and 1403 , partitioned from and reverted to holstein-rendsburg in 1386 king olav iv of norway and his mother-regent , queen margaret i , enfeoffed in nyborg gerhard vi , count of holstein-rendsburg and his cognatic successors with the duchy of schleswig
