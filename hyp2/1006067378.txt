the organizers of environmental rights day , led by marc mcginnes , had been working closely over a period of several months with congressman pete mccloskey ( r-ca ) to consult on the creation of the national environmental policy act , the first of many new environmental protection laws sparked by the national outcry about the blowout/oil spill and on the declaration of environmental rights both mccloskey ( earth day co-chair with senator gaylord nelson ) and earth day organizer denis hayes , along with senator alan cranston , paul ehrlich , david brower and other prominent leaders , endorsed the declaration and spoke about it at the environmental rights day conference '' it now is observed in 192 countries , and coordinated by the nonprofit earth day network , chaired by the first earth day 1970 organizer denis hayes , according to whom earth day is now '' the largest secular holiday in the world , celebrated by more than a billion people every year '' walter reuther , president of the united auto workers , made the first donation to support the first earth day in the amount of 2,000 according to denis hayes , '' the uaw was by far the largest contributor to the first earth day '' and '' without the uaw , the first earth day would have likely flopped ! '' hayes further said , '' walter ’ s presence at our first press conference utterly changed the dynamics of the coverage—we had instant credibility mobilizing 200 & nbsp ; million people in 141 countries and lifting the status of environmental issues onto the world stage , earth day activities in 1990 gave a huge boost to recycling efforts worldwide and helped pave the way for the 1992 united nations earth summit in rio de janeiro two separate groups formed to sponsor earth day events in 1990 : the earth day 20 foundation , assembled by edward furia ( project director of earth week in 1970 ) , and earth day 1990 , assembled by denis hayes ( national coordinator for earth day 1970 ) among the disagreements , key earth day 20 foundation organizers were critical of earth day 1990 for including on their board hewlett-packard , a company that at the time was the second-biggest emitter of chlorofluorocarbons in silicon valley and refused to switch to alternative solvents the earth day 20 foundation highlighted its april 22 activities in george , washington , near the columbia river with a live satellite phone call with members of the historic earth day 20 international peace climb who called from their base camp on mount everest to pledge their support for world peace and attention to environmental issues the master of ceremonies for the columbia gorge event was the tv star , john ratzenberger , from cheers , and the headlining musician was the '' father of rock and roll '' , chuck berry '' the four toolkits are : earth day action toolkit : educating and activating communities for change environmental teach-in toolkit global day of conversation toolkit for local governments mobilizeu : campus teach-in toolkit 2017 also saw the earth day network co-organize the march for science rally and teach-in at the national mall in washington , d.c according to nelson , the moniker '' earth day '' was '' an obvious and logical name '' suggested by a lot of other people in the fall of 1969 , including , he writes , both '' a friend of mine who had been in the field of public relations '' and '' a new york advertising executive , '' julian koenig koenig , who had been on nelson 's organizing committee in 1969 , has said that the idea came to him by the coincidence of his birthday with the day selected , april 22 ; '' earth day '' rhyming with '' birthday , '' the connection seemed natural other names circulated during preparations—nelson himself continued to call it the national environment teach-in , but national coordinator denis hayes used the term earth day in his communications and press coverage of the event was '' practically unanimous '' in its use of '' earth day '' , so the name stuck flora macdonald , then mp for kingston and the islands and former canadian secretary of state for external affairs , officially opened earth day week on september 6 , 1980 , with a ceremonial tree planting and encouraged mps and mpps across the country to declare a cross-canada annual earth day the equinoctial earth day is celebrated on the march equinox ( around march 20 ) to mark the arrival of astronomical spring in the northern hemisphere , and of astronomical autumn in the southern hemisphere un secretary-general u thant supported mcconnell 's global initiative to celebrate this annual event ; and on february 26 , 1971 , he signed a proclamation to that effect , saying : may there be only peaceful and cheerful earth days to come for our beautiful spaceship earth as it continues to spin and circle in frigid space with its warm and fragile cargo of animate life united nations secretary-general kurt waldheim observed earth day with similar ceremonies on the march equinox in 1972 , and the united nations earth day ceremony has continued each year since on the day of the march equinox ( the united nations also works with organizers of the april 22 global event ) earth day is the first holy day which transcends all national borders , yet preserves all geographical integrities , spans mountains and oceans and time belts , and yet brings people all over the world into one resonating accord , is devoted to the preservation of the harmony in nature and yet draws upon the triumphs of technology , the measurement of time , and instantaneous communication through space earth day draws on astronomical phenomena in a new way – which is also the most ancient way – by using the vernal equinox , the time when the sun crosses the equator making the length of night and day equal in all parts of the earth at the moment of the equinox , it is traditional to observe earth day by ringing the japanese peace bell , which was donated by japan to the united nations on march 20 , 2008 , in addition to the ceremony at the united nations , ceremonies were held in new zealand , and bells were sounded in california , vienna , paris , lithuania , tokyo , and many other locations the international day of peace is celebrated on september 21 , and can thus be considered to accord with the original intentions of john mcconnell , u thant and others the national park service , john muir national historic site , has a celebration every year on or around earth day ( april 21 , 22 or 23 ) , called birthday-earth day , in recognition of earth day and john muir 's contribution to the collective consciousness of environmentalism and conservation time reported that some suspected the date was not a coincidence , but a clue that the event was '' a communist trick '' , and quoted a member of the daughters of the american revolution as saying , '' subversive elements plan to make american children live in an environment that is good for them the idea that the date was chosen to celebrate lenin 's centenary still persists in some quarters , an idea borne out by the similarity with the subbotnik instituted by lenin in 1920 as days on which people would have to do community service , which typically consisted in removing rubbish from public property and collecting recyclable material subbotniks were also imposed on other countries within the compass of soviet power , including eastern europe , and at the height of its power the soviet union established a nationwide subbotnik to be celebrated on lenin 's birthday , april 22 , which had been proclaimed a national holiday celebrating communism by nikita khrushchev in 1955 air pollution arbor day carbon footprint '' earth '' , a song by lil dicky earth charter earth hour earth strike ecology flag environmental politics expo '74 : '' celebrating tomorrow 's fresh new environment '' international day of forests international mother earth day ira einhorn live earth pale blue dot politics of global warming world environment day by the united nations environment programme ( unep ) world soil day world cleanup day world water day government 's earth day site earth day canada – the canadian official site for earth day earth day at the history channel gaylord nelson and earth day : the making of the modern environmental movement narrative account of the origins of earth day , nelson 's political career , as well as online access to documents from the wisconsin historical society 's nelson papers collection
