charles beauregard , a ( non-vampire ) agent of the diogenes club , is sent to track the murderer down , and finds himself enmeshed in a plot to free england from dracula 's rule to give just two examples : the heroine geneviève dieudonné is recycled from newman 's own warhammer novels ( first appearing in 1989 drachenfels , written under the name jack yeovil ) , and carl kolchak has a brief cameo as a reporter following the ripper case ( newman has said that if he had realised he would get so many sequels out of the premise , he would have saved kolchak up for a story set in the character 's native 1970s ) first published in october 1992 , anno dracula has won the dracula society 's children of the night award , the lord ruthven assembly 's fiction award , and the international horror guild award for best novel , and was short-listed for the bram stoker award for best novel the encyclopedia of fantasy classifies anno dracula as '' recursive fantasy '' , and further describes the work as not '' strictly steampunk , but echoing in gaslight romance terms steampunk 's dense reworking of a 19th century london the graf von dracula , after being expelled from the united kingdom in 1897 , spread his brand of unstable vampirism ( and with it raging lycanthropy ) throughout the russian imperial family the films of federico fellini are an influence on the setting and atmosphere , and several of his characters appear in the novel the novel is a collection of reworked short stories and novellas written and published by newman in a variety of ways in between 1998 and 2013 , with some new material 45 , spider-man , blade , buffy the vampire slayer , the deathmaster , elvira , the light at the end , death wish , convoy , vampirella , natural born killers , badlands , nocturna , cruising , vampire junction , the addiction , the keep , and the lost boys , as well as taking its title from a character in the film dracula ad 1972 ( online ) coppola 's dracula won the international horror guild award for best long fiction , and was nominated for the bram stoker award for best long fiction the story 's first-person narrator , a private investigator , investigates the death of his ex-wife , found at the bottom of her swimming pool with an iron spike driven through her forehead , and the disappearance of her daughter , last seen falling in with a crowd of vampire cultists ( the private investigator , though not named in the story , is clearly raymond chandler 's philip marlowe , and his ex-wife is the recurring character linda loring , whom marlowe married in chandler 's unfinished final novel poodle springs—after initially rejecting the idea because he knew it would not last ) ( online ) '' who dares wins '' includes an appearance by richard jeperson , the central character in one of newman 's other main sets of stories , the diogenes club series ( the title combines those of two of welles ' movies : chimes at midnight and the other side of the wind , the latter of which was left uncompleted at welles ' death in 1985 a ship of vampires , led by genevieve dieudonne , captain kostaki , sergeant dravot and princess christina light , are exiled from england , seek refuge in japan , and are trapped in yōkai town , a ghetto where tokyo 's vampires are kept out of sight and out of mind like one thousand monsters , this novel is set in tokyo , where vampire schoolgirl nezumi and other unusual guests arrive to '' see in the new millennium '' at a party in the town 's old yōkai ghetto although it is not technically an anno dracula story , as it occurs before the events of anno dracula diverge from those in dracula , it may still be considered as an adjunct to the series the killings fan the flame of anti-vampire hatred , already at a dangerous level due to enoch powell 's recent rivers of blood speech ( which , in this timeline , is not a metaphorical title ) in a 2000 interview , newman said that he had scripted an anno dracula movie for stuart pollok and andré jacquemetton , who originally wanted daniel day-lewis and isabelle adjani for beauregard and geneviève , and then ralph fiennes and juliette binoche after they became too old according to an interview on may 16 , 2008 , the rights to an anno dracula movie have been optioned , and newman has written a script , but '' i do n't know if there 's much movement on it.over the years , i 've had a few comics people say they 'd be interested and even an occasional game nibble , but no one has ever come up with a solid deal '' upon publishing extracts of the script in an updated version of the first book , newman revealed the film would have used the likeness of peter cushing to represent the head of the deceased van helsing , establishing elements of the hammer productions dracula film series as the backdrop for the film adaptation 's events , specifically an imagined alternate ending to the 1958 dracula film vampires are also capable of shapeshifting , and in the case of dracula himself , to possess the bodies of others if his original is destroyed , as displayed in johnny alucard , when dracula , assumed dead after dracula cha cha cha , returns after having lain dormant in a younger vampire he turned at one point however an interesting sidenote is that to '' create '' a new bloodline you have to be bitten by many different vampires during your mortal life then when you die as a mortal you resurrect as a new type of vampire , such as a shape-shifting vampire lord ruthven , the british prime minister , says of dracula : some vampires have an aversion to crucifixes , holy water and the like , but newman portrays this a superstition ; vampires without such '' silly ideas '' show no ill effects from religious symbols zombies exist , but are said to be types of vampires caused by an epidemic bloodline that damages the brain and requires the vampire to chew blood from flesh rather than drink it from the vein ; like 'normal ' zombies , they spread their infection through simple biting and can only be killed by destroying the brain anno dracula : the background by kim newman anno dracula
