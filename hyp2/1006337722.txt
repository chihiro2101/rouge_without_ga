in the gut , for example , sodium is transported out of the reabsorbing cell on the blood ( interstitial fluid ) side via the na⁺-k⁺ pump , whereas , on the reabsorbing ( lumenal ) side , the na⁺-glucose symporter uses the created na⁺ gradient as a source of energy to import both na⁺ and glucose , which is far more efficient than simple diffusion according to the blaustein-hypothesis , this carrier enzyme ( na⁺/ca²⁺ exchanger , ncx ) uses the na gradient generated by the na⁺-k⁺ pump to remove ca²⁺ from the intracellular space , hence slowing down the na⁺-k⁺ pump results in a permanently elevated ca²⁺ level in the muscle , which may be the mechanism of the long-term inotropic effect of cardiac glycosides such as digoxin export of sodium from the cell provides the driving force for several secondary active transporters membrane transport proteins , which import glucose , amino acids , and other nutrients into the cell by use of the sodium gradient for instance , na⁺/k⁺-atpase found in the membrane of heart cells is an important target of cardiac glycosides ( for example digoxin and ouabain ) , inotrope drugs used to improve heart performance by increasing its force of contraction the sodium–potassium pump mechanism moves 3 sodium ions out and moves 2 potassium ions in , thus , in total , removing one positive charge carrier from the intracellular space ( please see mechanism for details ) that binds potassium , when it is in a phosphorylated state , to transfer potassium inside the cell '' after this essential binding occurs , a dephosphorylation of the alpha subunit occurs which reduces the effect of cardiac disease in order to maintain the cell membrane potential , cells keep a low concentration of sodium ions and high levels of potassium ions within the cell ( intracellular ) immediately after muscle contraction , intracellular ca²⁺ is quickly returned to its normal concentration by a carrier enzyme in the plasma membrane , and a calcium pump in sarcoplasmic reticulum , causing the muscle to relax the phosphorylated form of the pump has a low affinity for na⁺ ions , so they are released ; by contrast it has high affinity for the k⁺ ions this was first discovered in red blood cells ( schrier , 1966 ) , but has later been evidenced in renal cells , smooth muscles surrounding the blood vessels , and cardiac purkinje cells recently , glycolysis has also been shown to be of particular importance for na⁺/k⁺-atpases in skeletal muscles , where inhibition of glycogen breakdown ( a substrate for glycolysis ) leads to reduced na⁺/k⁺-atpase activity and lower force production na⁺/k⁺-atpase was discovered by jens christian skou in 1957 while working as assistant professor at the department of physiology , university of aarhus , denmark in 1997 , he received one-half of the nobel prize in chemistry '' for the first discovery of an ion-transporting enzyme , na⁺ , k⁺-atpase furthermore , when the cell begins to swell , this automatically activates the na⁺-k⁺ pump because it changes the internal concentrations of na⁺-k⁺ to which the pump is sensitive however , apart from the population of na/k-atpase in the plasma membrane—responsible for ion transport -- , there is another population in the caveolae which acts as digitalis receptor and stimulates the egf receptor the problem with this hypothesis is that at pharmacological concentrations of digitalis , less than 5 % of na/k-atpase molecules—specifically the α2 isoform in heart and arterial smooth muscle ( k d 32 nm ) -- are inhibited , not enough to affect the intracellular concentration of na⁺ in fact , all cells expend a large fraction of the atp they produce ( typically 30 % and up to 70 % in nerve cells ) to maintain their required cytosolic na and k concentrations
