when conducting an ethnography , anthropologists must be '' open with funders , colleagues , persons studied or providing information , and relevant parties affected by the work about the purpose ( s ) , potential impacts , and source ( s ) of support for the work herodotus , known as the father of history , had significant works on the cultures of various peoples beyond the hellenic realm such as the scythians , which earned him the title '' philobarbarian '' , and may be said to have produced the first works of ethnography writing culture helped bring changes to both anthropology and ethnography often described in terms of being 'postmodern , ' 'reflexive , ' 'literary , ' 'deconstructive , ' or 'poststructural ' in nature , in that the text helped to highlight the various epistemic and political predicaments that many practitioners saw as plaguing ethnographic representations and practices american anthropology association code of ethics p.1 in 2009 the association adopted a code of ethics , stating : anthropologists have '' moral obligations as members of other groups , such as the family , religion , and community , as well as the profession '' often this type of research results in a case study or field study such as an analysis of speech patterns at a protest rally , or the way firemen communicate during '' down time '' at a fire station studies such as gerry philipsen analysis of cultural communication strategies in a blue-collar , working-class neighborhood on the south side of chicago , speaking 'like a man ' in teamsterville , paved the way for the expansion of ethnographic research in the study of communication this critical turn in sociocultural anthropology during the mid-1980s can be traced to the influence of the now classic ( and often contested ) text , writing culture : the poetics and politics of ethnography , ( 1986 ) edited by james clifford and george marcus the physical entity that is the novel contains a specific image in the perspective of the interpreting individual and can only be expressed by the individual in the terms of '' i can tell you what an image is by telling you what it feels like urban sociology , atlanta university ( now clark-atlanta university ) , and the chicago school , in particular , are associated with ethnographic research , with some well-known early examples being the philadelphia negro ( 1899 ) by w '' the unobtrusive ethnographer '' – as a '' participant '' in the scene , the researcher will always have an effect on the communication that occurs within the research site 190-191 along with the development of experimental forms such as 'dialogic anthropology , ' 'narrative ethnography , ' and 'literary ethnography ' , literary ethnography writing culture helped to encourage the development of 'collaborative ethnography american anthropology association code of ethics , p.1-8 '' conducting research '' - when conducting research anthropologists need to be aware of the potential impacts of the research on the people and animals they study in this regard , the best way to integrate ethnography in a quantitative research would be to use it to discover and uncover relationships and then use the resultant data to test and explain the empirical assumptions in certain instances , active collaboration between the researcher ( s ) and subject ( s ) has helped blend the practice of collaboration in ethnographic fieldwork with the process of creating the ethnographic product resulting from the research impact : '' does this affect me ? emotionally ? intellectually ? '' does it move me ? expresses a reality : '' does it seem 'true'—a credible account of a cultural , social , individual , or communal sense of the 'real ' ? '' according to dewan ( 2018 ) , the researcher is not looking for generalizing the findings ; rather , they are considering it in reference to the context of the situation but even though many sub-fields and theoretical perspectives within sociology use ethnographic methods , ethnography is not the sine qua non of the discipline , as it is in cultural anthropology '' american anthropology association code of ethics , p.5-6 research results of ethnographies should not be withheld from participants in the research if that research is being observed by other people the image presents the perspective , experiences , and influences of an individual as a single entity and in consequence , the individual will always contain this image in the group under study 190 in regards to this last point , writing culture became a focal point for looking at how ethnographers could describe different cultures and societies without denying the subjectivity of those individuals and groups being studied while simultaneously doing so without laying claim to absolute knowledge and objective authority ethnography can also be used in other methodological frameworks , for instance , an action research program of study where one of the goals is to change and improve the situation reflexivity refers to the researcher 's aim '' to explore the ways in which the researcher 's involvement with a particular study influences , acts upon and informs such research '' a modern example of this technology in application , is the use of captured audio in smart devices , transcribed to issue targeted adverts ( often reconciled vs other metadata , or product development data for designers american anthropology association code of ethics , p.2-3 if the seeking of new knowledge will negatively impact the people and animals they will be studying they may not undertake the study according to the code of ethics argonauts of the western pacific ( 1922 ) by bronisław malinowski , ethnologische excursion in johore ( 1875 ) by nicholas miklouho-maclay , coming of age in samoa ( 1928 ) by margaret mead , the nuer ( 1940 ) by e ethnography as a method is a storied , careful , and systematic examination of the reality-generating mechanisms of everyday life ( coulon , 1995 ) in ethnography , the researcher gathers what is available , what is normal , what it is that people do , what they say , and how they work ethnographic research can range from a realist perspective , in which behavior is observed , to a constructivist perspective where understanding is socially constructed by the researcher and subjects the typical ethnography is a document written about a particular people , almost always based at least in part on emic views of where the culture begins and ends ethnographers ' systematic and holistic approach to real-life experience is valued by product developers , who use the method to understand unstated desires or cultural practices that surround products the association acknowledges that the code is limited in scope ; ethnographic work can sometimes be multidisciplinary , and anthropologists need to be familiar with ethics and perspectives of other disciplines as well '' the literary ethnographer '' – representation is a balancing act of determining what to '' show '' through poetic/prosaic language and style , versus what to '' tell '' via straightforward , 'factual ' reporting other notable ethnographies include paul willis 's learning to labour , on working class youth ;
