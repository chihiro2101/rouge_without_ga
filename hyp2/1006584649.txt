apprenticeship is the preferred term of the european commission and the one selected for use by the european centre for the development of vocational training , which has developed many studies on the subject they happen dissociated from any educational curricula , which means that , usually , the apprentices are not involved in any educational programme at the same time but , even if they are , there is no relation between the undergoing studies and the apprenticeship they vary in terms of governance , some being more employer lead and others more educational institution lead , but they are always associated with a curriculum and are designed as a mean for students to put theory in practice and master knowledge in a way that empowers them with professional autonomy a master craftsman was entitled to employ young people as an inexpensive form of labour in exchange for providing food , lodging and formal training in the craft most apprentices aspired to becoming master craftsmen themselves on completion of their contract ( usually a term of seven years ) , but some would spend time as a journeyman and a significant proportion would never acquire their own workshop the australian government uses australian apprenticeships centres to administer and facilitate australian apprenticeships so that funding can be disseminated to eligible businesses and apprentices and trainees and to support the whole process as it underpins the future skills of australian industry this is where businesses that are not able to employ the australian apprentice for the full period until they qualify , are able to lease or hire the australian apprentice from a group training organisation it is a safety net , because the group training organisation is the employer and provides continuity of employment and training for the australian apprentice in addition to a safety net , group training organisations ( gto ) have other benefits such as additional support for both the host employer and the trainee/apprentice through an industry consultant who visits regularly to make sure that the trainee/apprentice are fulfilling their work and training obligations with their host employer on the one hand , it is a prerequisite for the admission to the master craftsman exam and for qualification tests , and on the other hand it gives access to higher education via the tve-exam or the higher education entrance exam which are prerequisites for taking up studies at colleges , universities , '' fachhochschulen '' , post-secondary courses and post-secondary colleges in the czech republic , the term '' vocational school '' ( učiliště ) can refer to the two , three or four years of secondary practical education depending on the profession , they may work for two to three days a

completing a 3 or 4-year apprenticeship is called '' certificat fédérale de capacité '' in french , '' eidgenössisches fähigkeitszeugnis '' in german and '' attestato federale di capacità '' ( afc ) in italian in france , apprenticeships also developed between the ninth and thirteenth centuries , with guilds structured around apprentices , journeyman and master craftsman , continuing in this way until 1791 , when the guilds were suppressed the first training centres for apprentices ( centres de formation d'apprentis , cfas ) appeared in 1961 , and in 1971 apprenticeships were legally made part of professional training from 1987 the range of qualifications achieveable through an apprenticeship was widened to include the brevet professionnel ( certificate of vocational aptitude ) , the bac professionnel ( vocational baccalaureate diploma ) , the brevet de technicien supérieur ( advanced technician 's certificate ) , engineering diplomas , master 's degree and more the french government pledged to further develop apprenticeship as a path to success at school and to employment , based on its success : in 2005 , 80 % of young french people who had completed an apprenticeship entered employment ) the minister in charge of the campaign , jean-louis borloo , also hoped to improve the image of apprenticeships with an information campaign , as they are often connected with academic failure at school and an ability to grasp only practical skills and not theory it regulates the programme of training of apprentices in the industry so as to conform to the syllabi , period of training etc as laid down by the central apprenticeship council and to utilise fully the facilities available in industry for imparting practical training with a view to meeting the requirements of

on-going assessments through on-the-job competence testing as well as off-the-job modular assessments and examinations , if passed successfully the apprentice is awarded an advanced certificate in craft ( level 6 on the national framework of qualifications ) instead of formal testing for evaluation , articles of clothing must meet the quality standards before they can be sold and before the apprentice can begin a new design highlights of the modern apprenticeship system are : – inclusion of services , agriculture and mining sector – cost sharing by industry and government – regulating and formalizing informal apprenticeships – mainstream apprenticeship qualifications with national vocational qualifications framework ( pakistan nvqf ) – increased participation of female – training cost reimbursement ( for those industries training more number of apprentices than the required ) – assessment and certification of apprentices jointly by industry – chamber of commerce & industry –

information technology universities still use apprenticeship schemes in their production of scholars : bachelors are promoted to masters and then produce a thesis under the oversight of a supervisor before the corporate body of the university recognises the achievement of the standard of a doctorate in the '' wealth of nations '' adam smith states that : seven years seem anciently to have been , all over europe , the usual term established for the duration of apprenticeships in the greater part of incorporated trades as to have wrought seven years under a master properly qualified was necessary in order to entitle any person to become a master , and to have himself apprenticed in a common trade ; so to have studied seven years under a master properly qualified was necessary to entitle him to become a master , teacher , or doctor ( words anciently synonymous ) in the liberal arts , and to have scholars or apprentices ( words likewise originally synonymous ) to study under him also similar to apprenticeships are the professional development arrangements for new graduates in the professions of accountancy , engineering , management consulting , and the law the learning curve in modern professional service firms , such as law firms , consultancies or accountancies , generally resembles the traditional master-apprentice model : the newcomer to the firm is assigned to one or several more experienced colleagues ( ideally partners in the firm ) and learns his skills on the job
