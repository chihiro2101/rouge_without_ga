electrophysiology is the branch of physiology that pertains broadly to the flow of ions ( ion current ) in biological tissues and , in particular , to the electrical recording techniques that enable the measurement of this flow the principal types of electrodes are : simple solid conductors , such as discs and needles ( singles or arrays , often insulated except for the tip ) , tracings on printed circuit boards or flexible polymers , also insulated except for the tip , and hollow tubes filled with an electrolyte , such as glass pipettes filled with potassium chloride solution or another electrolyte solution the principal preparations include : living organisms , excised tissue ( acute or cultured ) , dissociated cells from excised tissue ( acute or cultured ) , artificially grown cells or tissues , or hybrids of the above neuronal electrophysiology is the study of electrical properties of biological cells and tissues within the nervous system the electrolyte within the pipette may be brought into fluid continuity with the cytoplasm by delivering a pulse of negative pressure to the pipette in order to rupture the small patch of membrane encircled by the pipette rim ( whole-cell recording ) still larger electrodes , such as uninsulated needles and surface electrodes used by clinical and surgical neurophysiologists , are sensitive only to certain types of synchronous activity within populations of cells numbering in the millions to make an intracellular recording , the tip of a fine ( sharp ) microelectrode must be inserted inside the cell , so that the membrane potential can be measured in 1963 , alan lloyd hodgkin and andrew fielding huxley won the nobel prize in physiology or medicine for their contribution to understanding the mechanisms underlying the generation of action potentials in neurons their experiments involved intracellular recordings from the giant axon of atlantic squid ( loligo pealei ) , and were among the first applications of the '' voltage clamp '' technique the microelectrode is placed next to a cell , and gentle suction is applied through the microelectrode to draw a piece of the cell membrane ( the 'patch ' ) into the microelectrode tip ; the glass tip forms a high resistance 'seal ' with the cell membrane this configuration is the '' cell-attached '' mode , and it can be used for studying the activity of the ion channels that are present in the patch of membrane if more suction is now applied , the small patch of membrane in the electrode tip can be displaced , leaving the electrode sealed to the rest of the cell a disadvantage ( compared to conventional intracellular recording with sharp electrodes ) is that the intracellular fluid of the cell mixes with the solution inside the recording electrode , and so some important components of the intracellular fluid can be diluted instead of applying suction to displace the membrane patch from the electrode tip , it is also possible to make small holes on the patch with pore-forming agents so that large molecules such as proteins can stay inside the cell and ions can pass through the holes freely these micropipettes ( electrodes ) are again like those for patch clamp pulled from glass capillaries , but the pore is much smaller so that there is very little ion exchange between the intracellular fluid and the electrolyte in the pipette available online at often the tip of the electrode is filled with various kinds of dyes like lucifer yellow to fill the cells recorded from , for later confirmation of their morphology under a microscope the dyes are injected by applying a positive or negative , dc or pulsed voltage to the electrodes depending on the polarity of the dye for example , david hubel and torsten wiesel recorded the activity of single neurons in the primary visual cortex of the anesthetized cat , and showed how single neurons in this area respond to very specific features of a visual stimulus this type of recording is often called '' multi-unit recording '' , and is often used in conscious animals to record changes in the activity in a discrete brain area during normal activity recordings from one or more such electrodes that are closely spaced can be used to identify the number of cells around it as well as which of the spikes come from which cell if the electrode tip is bigger still , in general the activity of individual neurons can not be distinguished but the electrode will still be able to record a field potential generated by the activity of many cells at the right , the lower trace shows a negative wave that corresponds to a current sink caused by positive charges entering cells through postsynaptic glutamate receptors , while the upper trace shows a positive wave that is generated by the current that leaves the cell ( at the cell body ) to complete the circuit the bioelectric recognition assay ( bera ) is a novel method for determination of various chemical and biological molecules by measuring changes in the membrane potential of cells immobilized in a gel matrix in this way , when a positive sample is added to the sensor , a characteristic , '' signature-like '' change in electrical potential occurs ( 2009 ) development of a novel , ultra-rapid biosensor for the qualitative detection of hepatitis b virus-associated antigens and anti-hbv , based on '' membrane-engineered '' fibroblast cells with virus-specific antibodies and antigens the method has also been used for the detection of environmental toxins , such as pesticides flampouri e , mavrikou s , kintzios s , miliaids g , aplada-sarli p ( 2010 ) mavrikou , s , flampouri , e , moschopoulou , g , mangana , o , michaelides , a , kintzios , s ( 2008 ) assessment of organophosphate and carbamate pesticide residues in cigarette tobacco with a novel cell biosensor talanta 84 : 936â€“40 apostolou t , pascual n , marco m-p , moschos a , petropoulos a , kaltsas g , kintzios s ( 2014 ) extraction-less , rapid assay for the direct detection of 2,4,6-trichloroanisole ( tca ) in cork samples there are significant drawbacks , given by the uncertainty of the legitimacy of the model and the computational cost of modeling systems that are large enough and over sufficient timescales to be considered reproducing the macroscopic properties of the systems themselves for example , clinical cardiac electrophysiology is the study of the electrical properties which govern heart rhythm and activity the '' minimum information about a neuroscience investigation '' ( mini ) family of reporting guideline documents aims to provide a consistent set of guidelines in order to report an electrophysiology experiment
