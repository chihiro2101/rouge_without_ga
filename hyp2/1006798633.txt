langer and gleason , chapter 21 they made their joint declaration on 14 august 1941 from the us naval base on the bay , naval base argentia , which had recently been leased from britain as part of a deal that saw the americans give 50 surplus destroyers to british for use against german u-boats although the us would not enter the war as a combatant until the attack on pearl harbor , four months later 4 , 6 roosevelt 's attempts to tie britain to concrete war aims and churchill 's desperation to bind the us to the war effort helped to provide motivations for the meeting that produced the atlantic charter it was assumed at the time that the british and the americans would have an equal role to play in any postwar international organization that would be based on the charter 's principles 15–16 on 9 august 1941 , the british battleship hms prince of wales steamed into placentia bay , with churchill on board , and met the american heavy cruiser uss augusta , where roosevelt and members of his staff were waiting when it was released to the public on august 14 , 1941 , the charter was titled '' joint declaration by the president and the prime minister '' and was generally known as the '' joint declaration churchill 's account of the yalta conference quoted roosevelt as saying of the unwritten british constitution that '' it was like the atlantic charter – the document did not exist , yet all the world knew about it 140–41 then , at the meeting of the inter-allied council in london on 24 september 1941 , the governments-in-exile of belgium , czechoslovakia , greece , luxembourg , the netherlands , norway , poland , and yugoslavia , together with the soviet union and representatives of the free french forces , unanimously adopted adherence to the common principles of policy set forth by britain and united states on 1 january 1942 , a larger group of nations , which adhered to the charter 's principles , issued a joint declaration by united nations , which stressed their solidarity in the defence against hitlerism in tokyo , the atlantic charter rallied support for the militarists in the japanese government , which pushed for a more aggressive approach against the united states and britain the text cited the charter as the authoritative statement of the joint commitment of britain and the united states '' not to admit any economical discrimination of those defeated '' and promised that '' germany and the other states can again achieve enduring peace and prosperity the problems came not from germany and japan but the allies that had empires and so resisted self-determination , especially the united kingdom , the soviet union , and the netherlands sherwood , noted that '' it was not long before the people of india , burma , malaya , and indonesia were beginning to ask if the atlantic charter extended also to the pacific and to asia in general '' with a war that could be won only with the help of those allies , roosevelt 's solution was to put some pressure on britain but to postpone the issue of self-determination of the colonies until after the war 395–420 the british were forced to agree to those aims , but in a september 1941 speech , churchill stated that the charter was meant to apply only to states under german occupation , certainly not to those that were part of the british empire mahatma gandhi in 1942 wrote to roosevelt : '' i venture to think that the allied declaration that the allies are fighting to make the world safe for the freedom of the individual and for democracy sounds hollow so long as india and for that matter africa are exploited by great britain 59 self-determination was roosevelt 's guiding principle , but he was reluctant to place pressure on the british in regard to india and other colonial possessions , as they were fighting for their lives in a war in which the united states was not officially participating churchill was unhappy with the inclusion of references to the right to self-determination and stated that he considered the charter an '' interim and partial statement of war aims designed to reassure all countries of our righteous purpose and not the complete structure which we should build after the victory '' an office of the polish government-in-exile wrote to warn władysław sikorski that if the charter was implemented with regard to national self-determination , it would prevent the desired polish annexation of danzig , east prussia and parts of german silesia during the war , churchill argued for an interpretation of the charter that would allow the soviet union to continue to control the baltic states , an interpretation that was rejected by the united states until march 1944
