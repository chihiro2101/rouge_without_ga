the stepper motor is known for its property of converting a train of input pulses ( typically square waves ) into a precisely defined increment in the shaft ’ s rotational position each of those rotations is called a '' step '' , with an integer number of steps making a full rotation the circular arrangement of electromagnets is divided into groups , each group called a phase , and there is an equal number of electromagnets per group for example , if the stepper motor has two groups identified as a or b , and ten electromagnets in total , then the grouping pattern would be ababababab because of this , stepper motors with more phases typically have more wires ( or leads ) to control the motor there are three main types of stepper motors : permanent magnet stepper reluctance motor hybrid synchronous stepper permanent magnet motors use a permanent magnet ( pm ) in the rotor and operate on the attraction or repulsion between the rotor pm and the stator electromagnets variable reluctance ( vr ) motors have a plain iron rotor and operate based on the principle that minimum reluctance occurs with minimum gap , hence the rotor points are attracted toward the stator magnets since in this arrangement a magnetic pole can be reversed without switching the direction of current , the commutation circuit can be made very simple ( e.g a microcontroller or stepper motor controller can be used to activate the drive transistors in the right order , and this ease of operation makes unipolar motors popular with hobbyists ; they are probably the cheapest way to get precise angular movements the current in a winding needs to be reversed in order to reverse a magnetic pole , so the driving circuit must be more complicated , typically with an h-bridge arrangement ( however there are several off-the-shelf driver chips available to make this a simple affair ) a unipolar motor has twice the amount of wire in the same space , but only half used at any point in time , hence is 50 % efficient ( or approximately 70 % of the torque output available ) an 8-lead stepper is like a unipolar stepper , but the leads are not joined to common internally to the motor an additional limitation , often comparable to the effects of inductance , is the back-emf of the motor as the motor 's rotor turns , a sinusoidal voltage is generated proportional to the speed ( step rate ) thus when controlled by a constant voltage drive , the maximum speed of a stepper motor is limited by its inductance since at some speed , the voltage u will be changing faster than the current i can keep up if properly tuned , this compensates the effects of inductance and back-emf , allowing decent performance relative to current-mode drivers , but at the expense of design effort ( tuning procedures ) that are simpler for current-mode drivers this requires additional electronics to sense winding currents , and control the switching , but it allows stepper motors to be driven with higher torque at higher speeds than l/r drives thumb a stepper motor is a polyphase ac synchronous motor ( see theory below ) , and it is ideally driven by sinusoidal current a full-step waveform is a gross approximation of a sinusoid , and is the reason why the motor exhibits so much vibration wave drive and single phase full step are both one and the same , with same number of steps but difference in torque zaber.com , microstepping regardless of the waveform used , as the microsteps become smaller , motor operation becomes more smooth , thereby greatly reducing resonance in any parts the motor may be connected to , as well as the motor itself example : many modern hybrid step motors are rated such that the travel of every full step ( example 1.8 degrees per full step or 200 full steps per revolution ) will be within 3 % or 5 % of the travel of every other full step , as long as the motor is operated within its specified operating ranges several manufacturers show that their motors can easily maintain the 3 % or 5 % equality of step travel size as step size is reduced from full stepping down to 1/10 stepping at large step size reductions it is possible to issue many microstep commands before any motion occurs at all and then the motion can be a '' jump '' to a new position a step motor can be viewed as a synchronous ac motor with the number of poles ( on both rotor and stator ) increased , taking care that they have no common denominator additionally , soft magnetic material with many teeth on the rotor and stator cheaply multiplies the number of poles ( reluctance motor ) winding inductance and counter-emf generated by a moving rotor tend to resist changes in drive current , so that as the motor speeds up , less and less time is spent at full current—thus reducing motor torque this is the measure of the torque produced by a stepper motor when it is operated without an acceleration state at low speeds the stepper motor can synchronize itself with an applied step frequency , and this pull-in torque must overcome friction and inertia into this region , the motor can be started/stopped instantaneously with a load applied and without loss of synchronism the stepper motor pull-out torque is measured by accelerating the motor to the desired speed and then increasing the torque loading until the motor stalls or misses steps these figures can be helpful for more in-depth electronics design , when deviating from standard supply voltages , adapting third party driver electronics , or gaining insight when choosing between motor models with otherwise similar size , voltage , and torque specifications in the field of lasers and optics they are frequently used in precision positioning equipment such as linear actuators , linear stages , rotation stages , goniometers , and mirror mounts a stepper motor system consists of three basic elements , often combined with some type of user interface ( host computer , plc or dumb terminal ) : ; indexers : the indexer ( or controller ) is a microprocessor capable of generating step pulses and direction signals for the driver advantages of step motors are low cost , high reliability , high torque at low speeds and a simple , rugged construction that operates in almost any environment the main disadvantages in using a stepper motor is the resonance effect often exhibited at low speeds and decreasing torque with increasing speed the motor has full torque at standstill ( if the windings are energized ) precise positioning and repeatability of movement since good stepper motors have an accuracy of 3–5 % of a step and this error is non-cumulative from one step to the next a wide range of rotational speeds can be realized as the speed is proportional to the frequency of the input pulses brushed dc electric motor brushless dc electric motor flange fractional horsepower motors servo motor solenoid three-phase ac synchronous motors uln2003a ( stepper motor ) driver ic jones , the university of iowa stepping 101 nema motor , reprapwiki stepping motor drive guide from dover motion ip65 stepper motors ip68 stepper motors flame proof motor
