ultimate play the game was founded in the leicestershire town of ashby-de-la-zouch in 1982 by tim and chris stamper , their friend john lathbury , and tim 's girlfriend ( later wife ) carole ward both tim and chris had worked in arcade game development including , according to one report , konami 's gyruss , and claimed to be '' the most experienced arcade video game design team in britain '' until tiring of working for others and leaving to start ashby computers and graphics this coincided with the introduction of the distinctive ultimate '' big box '' packaging ( used with all further spectrum releases until gunfright , and with various releases on other platforms ) , which the company felt might also help justify the price increase and encourage gamers to buy the game rather than copy it knight lore was something of a revolution in the home computer game market , using a forced-perspective isometric viewpoint branded filmation , the style of which would be extensively copied in other games , notable examples being batman and head over heels from ocean software knight lore , and some of its filmation follow-up alien 8 , was actually completed before sabre wulf but ultimate decided that it could have a potentially negative effect on sales of the comparatively primitive sabre wulf , so it was postponed until late 1984 for a simultaneous release with underwurlde ultimate was criticised somewhat in the gaming media for their repeated use of the filmation technique in subsequent games alien 8 , nightshade , gunfright and pentagram , though nightshade and gunfright used filmation ii , a variation on the engine , resulting in a similar visual style , but significantly different gameplay , with scrolling around a large world and arcade-like play , rather than the room-based puzzles of the earlier filmation titles with the consistent success of ultimate 's releases there were rumours of a buyout by ocean , until it was announced in 1985 that the stamper brothers had sold the ultimate catalogue and name to us gold , who would continue to release games under the ultimate label future releases were to have included solar jetman , which would eventually appear only on the nintendo entertainment system , although home computer conversions for the commodore 64 , commodore amiga , and atari st were completed by storm software , but not released in 2002 rare was purchased outright by microsoft for us 377 & nbsp ; million , a record fee for a video game developer , and currently develops games for the xbox one console when a journalist reviewing nightshade for crash magazine asked ultimate what the object of the game was , and how large the play area was , they responded with , respectively , '' oh , we ca n't tell you that '' and '' it 's pretty large '' the possible existence of a trailer ( as depicted on the game 's cover art and loading screen ) had been speculated on since the game 's release , and many fans had searched fruitlessly for it retro gamer has suggested that besides the quality of the games , ultimate 's popularity arose from a combination of '' superb presentation '' as well as the company 's '' air of mystique '' giving it a '' secretive yet cool vibe '' the main series of games produced by ultimate were all released on the sinclair zx spectrum , with most from sabre wulf onward also on the amstrad cpc and msx , and most early games up to and including nightshade also on the bbc micro only three of these ( sabre wulf , underwurlde and nightshade ) were released on the other major platform of the time , the commodore 64 , however a series of c64-exclusive titles were published by ultimate : : the staff of karnath ( 1984 ) : entombed ( 1984 ) : imhotep ( 1985 ) : blackwyche ( 1985 ) : outlaws ( 1985 ) : dragon skulle ( 1985 ) the staff of karnath , entombed , blackwyche and dragon skulle all concern the adventures of sir arthur pendragon whereas most games of the time would list those responsible on the cassette inlay cards or even on the front of the box ( one notable example , football manager , even going as far as to feature a picture of author kevin toms on the front of the box ) , no ultimate title ever mentioned any names at all , and the authorship of some of them remains unclear the ultimate titles up to gunfright were produced primarily by tim and chris stamper , tim provided the graphics and chris the programming , along with fellow founders john lathbury ( coding ) and carol ward ( graphic design ) this remains a possibility as although chris stamper has said in an interview , '' what was the last one we developed as a team ? it was gunfright , i think '' , ultimate had already admitted to developing games in an order different from that of their release , as with knight lore and sabre wulf the conversions of existing spectrum games sabre wulf , underwurlde and nightshade were handled by firebird , who hired mr micro , softstone , and psi , respectively , to develop the titles ultimate did not make any announcements regarding the authorship of the other commodore games , but an article by martyn carroll revealed how frank gasking of '' games that were n't 64 '' managed to identify the creators as dave and robert ( bob ) thomas based on a message that appears on the final screen of dragonskulle
