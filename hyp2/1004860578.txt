a mixing console is also known as an audio mixer , audio console , mixing desk , sound mixer , soundboard , or simply as board or mixer typically , each channel 's column contains a number of rotary potentiometer knobs , buttons , and faders for controlling the gain of the input preamplifier , adjusting the equalization of the signal on each channel , controlling routing of the input signal to other functional sections , and adjusting the channel 's contribution to the overall mix being produced a mixer intended for a live venue or a recording studio typically has a range of input jacks , such as xlr connectors for microphones and the outputs from di boxes , and 1/4 '' jacks for line level sources depending on the mixer , a channel may have buttons which enable the audio engineer to reroute the signal to a different output for monitoring purposes , turn on an attenuator pad ( often reducing the signal by 15 or 20 & nbsp ; db to prevent audio clipping ) , or activate other features , such as a high-pass filter on smaller mixers , the input jacks may be mounted on the top panel of the mixer to facilitate the connection and disconnection of inputs during the use of the mixer dynamic range compression , gating ) , if supported routing , including direct outs , auxiliary-sends , panning ( audio ) , and subgroup assignments level-control faders ( on small mixers , these may be rotary knobs to save space ) on many consoles , these sections are color-coded for quick identification by the operator the input/preamp conditions the signal from the external device and this controls the amount of amplification or attenuation that is applied to the input signal to bring it to a nominal level for processing a microphone plugged directly into a power amplifier would not produce an adequate signal level to drive loudspeakers , because the microphone 's signal is too weak ; the microphone signal needs a preamplifier to strengthen the signal so that it is strong enough for the power amplifier auxiliary sends can either be pre-fader or post-fader , in that the level of a pre-fader send is set by the auxiliary send control , whereas post-fade sends depend on the position of the channel fader as well pre-fade auxiliary sends can provide a monitor mix to musicians on stage ( which they hear through monitor speakers pointing at the performers or in-ear monitors ) ; this mix is thus independent of the main mix produced by the faders a sound engineer can use the cue feature to , for instance , get a sound recording they wish to play soon cued up to the start point of a song , without the listeners hearing these actions the signal from the cue system is fed to the console 's headphone amp and may also be available as a line-level output that is intended to drive a monitor speaker system the signals are summed to create the main mix , or combined on a bus as a submix , a group of channels that are then added as a whole to the final mix once again using the drum kit example , the use of bus-processing can enable the sound engineer to run all of the drum kit through an audio compressor effect to reduce unwanted signal peaks , rather than having to route all of the 10 or more mic signals on the drum kit individually this is usually desirable , as post-fader auxiliary sends are commonly used for effects such as reverb , and sends to these effects should track changes in the channel signal level in a typical live sound mixing context , with a band playing at a venue , consisting of a rhythm section , solo instrumentalists and singers , the master control section allows the audio engineer to control the volume of the entire group with just one fader ( for monaural mixers ) or a pair of left and right faders ( for stereo mixers ) subgroup and main output fader controls are often found together on the right hand side of the mixer or , on larger consoles , in a center section flanked by banks of input channels there are usually one or more vu or peak meters to indicate the levels for each channel , for the master outputs and to indicate whether the console levels are clipping the signal on meters using leds , there may be different colored leds to indicate when there is signal present in the channel 's input ; the audio level of the channel , typically by lighting up more leds ; and clipping , which may be indicated using a different colored led in one popular color-coding system , green leds indicate signal presence and the audio level ; one or more amber leds indicate that the channel is approaching clipping ; and one or more red leds indicate clipping in live sound , the cables from the onstage microphones and instrument outputs are not typically plugged directly into the mixer , because this would require a large number of individual cables to go from the stage to the mixer some mixing consoles , particularly those designed for broadcast and live sound , include facilities for mirroring two consoles , making both consoles exact copies of each other with the same inputs and outputs , the same settings , and the same audio mix there are two primary reasons for doing this ; one , in the event of a hardware failure , a second redundant console is already in place and can be switched to ( an important feature for live broadcasts ) ; second , it allows the operators to set up two identical mix positions , one at front of house — where the audio will be mixed during a performance — and the other at some other location within the theater ( e.g , with the broadcasting equipment ) ; this way , if the acoustics at front of house are unfavorable , a mix can be programmed at an acoustically better position in the room , and the presets ( on the faders and knobs ) can be accessed from the front of house console during the performance digital mixers have an unavoidable amount of latency , ranging from less than 1 & nbsp ; ms to as much as 10 & nbsp ; ms , depending on the model of digital mixer and what functions are engaged this small amount of latency is not a problem for loudspeakers aimed at the audience an not necessarily a problem for monitor wedges aimed at the artist , but can be disorienting and unpleasant for in-ear monitors where the artist hears their voice acoustically in their head and electronically amplified in their ears but delayed by a couple of milliseconds analog consoles have a column of dedicated , physical knobs , buttons , and faders for each channel , which is logical and familiar to generations of audio engineers who have been trained on analog mixers at the new venue , the traveling mix engineer simply plugs the collected data into the venue 's digital mixer and quickly makes small adjustments to the local input and output patch layout , allowing for full show readiness in very short order some digital mixers allow offline editing of the mix , a feature that lets the traveling technician use a laptop to make anticipated changes to the show , shortening the time it takes to prepare the sound system for the artist both digital and analog mixers rely on analog microphone preamplifiers , a high-gain circuit that increases the low signal level from a microphone to a level that is better matched to the console 's internal operating level experienced live sound professionals agree that the selection and quality of the microphones and loudspeakers ( with their innate higher potential for creating distortion ) are a much greater source of coloration of sound than the choice of mixer the use of remote control technology can be utilized to reduce the amount of venue space used for the front of house mixing console , nicknamed '' seat-kills '' in the music industry public address systems in schools , hospitals and other institutions use a mixing console to set microphones to an appropriate level and can add in recorded sounds such as music into the mix most rock and pop bands use a mixing console to combine musical instruments and vocals so that the mix can be amplified through a nightclub 's pa system these consoles , often referred to as '' air-boards '' are apt to have many fewer controls than mixers designed for live or studio production mixing , dropping pan/balance , eq , and multi-bus monitoring/aux feed knobs in favor of cue and output bus selectors , since , in a radio studio , nearly all sources are either prerecorded or preadjusted djs playing music for dancers at a dance club use a small dj mixer to make smooth transitions between different songs which are played on sound sources that are plugged into the mixer the most basic dj mixers have only two inputs , though some have four or more inputs for djs using a larger number of sound sources the tones generated from a no-input mixer are created by connecting an output of the mixer into an input channel and manipulating the pitch with the mixer 's dials
