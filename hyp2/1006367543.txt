source , or donor language – a system may be tailored to romanize text from a particular language , or a series of languages , or for any language in a particular writing system ) simplicity – since the basic latin alphabet has a smaller number of letters than many other writing systems , digraphs , diacritics , or special characters must be used to represent them all in latin script this affects the ease of creation , digital storage and transmission , reproduction , and reading of the romanized text if the romanization attempts to transliterate the original script , the guiding principle is a one-to-one mapping of characters in the source language into the target script , with less emphasis on how the result sounds when pronounced according to the reader 's language for example , the nihon-shiki romanization of japanese allows the informed reader to reconstruct the original japanese kana syllables with 100 % accuracy , but requires additional knowledge for correct pronunciation such romanizations follow the principle of phonemic orthography and attempt to render the significant sounds ( phonemes ) of the original as faithfully as possible in the target language a phonetic conversion goes one step further and attempts to depict all phones in the source language , sacrificing legibility if necessary by using characters or conventions not found in the target script pure transcriptions are generally not possible , as the source language usually contains sounds and distinctions not found in the target language , but which must be shown for the romanized form to be comprehensible furthermore , due to diachronic and synchronic variance no written language represents any spoken language with perfect accuracy and the vocal interpretation of a script may vary by a great degree among languages in modern times the chain of transcription is usually spoken foreign language , written foreign language , written native language , spoken ( read ) native language as an example , consider the japanese martial art 柔術 : the nihon-shiki romanization zyûzyutu may allow someone who knows japanese to reconstruct the kana syllables , but most native english speakers , or rather readers , would find it easier to guess the pronunciation from the hepburn version , jujutsu the arabic alphabet is used to write arabic , persian , urdu and pashto as well as numerous other languages in the muslim world , particularly african and asian languages without alphabets of their own there is a long tradition in the west to study sanskrit and other indic texts in latin transliteration the devanagari-specific portion is very similar to the academic standard , iast : '' international alphabet of sanskrit transliteration '' , and to the united states library of congress standard , ala-lc , although there are a few differences the national library at kolkata romanization , intended for the romanization of all indic scripts , is an extension of iast harvard-kyoto : uses upper and lower case and doubling of letters , to avoid the use of diacritics , and to restrict the range to 7-bit ascii however , in practice the situation is , in pakistan : standard ( saaf or khaalis ) urdu is the '' high '' variety , whereas hindustani is the '' low '' variety used by the masses ( called urdu , written in nastaʿlīq script ) in india , both standard ( shuddh ) hindi and standard ( saaf or khaalis ) urdu are the '' h '' varieties ( written in devanagari and nastaʿlīq respectively ) , whereas hindustani is the '' l '' variety used by the masses and written in either devanagari or nastaʿlīq ( and called 'hindi ' or 'urdu ' respectively ) the digraphia renders any work in either script largely inaccessible to users of the other script , though otherwise hindustani is a perfectly mutually intelligible language , essentially meaning that any kind of text-based open source collaboration is impossible among devanagari and nastaʿlīq readers the news international - dec 29 , 2011 -- '' hamari boli ( our language ) is perhaps one of the very first serious undertakings to explore , develop and encourage the growth of roman script in the use of urdu/hindi language the system is also used in other chinese-speaking areas such as singapore and parts of taiwan , and has been adopted by much of the international community as a standard for writing chinese words and names in the latin script the value of hanyu pinyin in education in china lies in the fact that china , like any other populated area with comparable area and population , has numerous distinct dialects , though there is just one common written language and one common standardized spoken form a slightly changed version of mr was the official system for korean in south korea from 1984 to 2000 , and yet a different modification is still the official system in north korea what is called mr may in many cases be any of a number of systems that differ from each other and from the original mr mostly in whether word endings are separated from the stem by a space , a hyphen or & nbsp ; – according to mccune 's and reischauer 's system & nbsp ; – not at all ; and if a hyphen or space is used , whether sound change is reflected in a stem 's last and an ending 's first consonant letter ( e.g word division is addressed in detail , with a generous use of spaces to separate word endings from stems that is not seen in mr in cases of ambiguity , orthographic syllable boundaries were intended to be indicated with a hyphen , but this is inconsistently applied in practice almost all languages of the philippines ( including tagalog , ilokano , the bicol languages , cebuano and other visayan languages , kapampangan , and the spanish-based creole chavacano ) use the filipino alphabet when spain colonised the philippines in the late 16th century , the numerous languages of the philippines were written in various scripts , such as baybayin these were eventually superseded by the pilipino alphabet and by the 28-letter , modern filipino alphabet , which adds ñ and the native ng to the standard , 26-letter latin alphabet for example , the spanish caballo ( kaˈβa.ʎo , '' horse '' ) , the same word in tagalog is kabayo ( demonstrating yeismo in the pronunciation of the spanish '' ll '' digraph ) thai , spoken in thailand and some areas of laos , burma and china , is written with thai alphabet , probably descended from mixture of tai–laotian and old khmer , in the brahmic family bgn/pcgn romanization of belarusian , 1979 ( united states board on geographic names and permanent committee on geographical names for british official use ) scientific transliteration , or the international scholarly system for linguistics ala-lc romanization , 1997 ( american library association and library of congress ) : iso 9:1995 instruction on transliteration of belarusian geographical names with letters of latin script , 2000 since the late 1990s , bulgarian authorities have switched to the so-called streamlined system avoiding the use of diacritics and optimized for compatibility with english the name of the russian composer tchaikovsky may also be written as tchaykovsky , tchajkovskij , tchaikowski , tschaikowski , czajkowski , čajkovskij , čajkovski , chajkovskij , çaykovski , chaykovsky , chaykovskiy , chaikovski , tshaikovski , tšaikovski , tsjajkovskij etc the latin script for syriac was developed in the 1930s , following the state policy for minority languages of the soviet union , with some material published
