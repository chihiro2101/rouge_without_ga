goryeo ’ s quest , through the writing of the samguk sagi , to secure its legitimacy and establish its continuation of the '' mantle of authority '' ( or mandate of heaven ) from the three kingdoms , meant as a necessary consequence that the compilers of the samguk sagi , unlike those of the jewang ungi or the goryeo dogyeong ( 高麗圖經 ) , emphasized united silla , the last survivor among the three kingdoms , and ignored balhae the samguk sagi was written on the basis of the gu samguksa ( 舊三國史 , old history of the three kingdoms ) , and other earlier historical records such as the hwarang segi ( 花郞世記 , annals of hwarang ) , most of which are no longer extant however , the fact that '' native heritage '' is primarily interpreted by the samguk sagi to mean '' three kingdoms heritage '' brings us to the work ’ s ostensibly broader purpose , and that was to promote three kingdoms ( in contrast to the competing neighbors like buyeo , mahan , and gaya , which were absorbed into the three kingdoms ) as the orthodox ruling kingdoms of korea , and to thus solidify the legitimacy and prestige of the goryeo state , as the three kingdoms ’ rightful successor though each of the three kingdoms of goguryeo , baekje , and silla had produced their own histories , these were largely lost in the continual wars , the fall of goguryeo and baekje , and the dispersal of their records according to mcbride , part of the theses of sin chaeho were that : : the real hero of the three kingdoms period was the koguryo general ulchi mundék , who , in 612 , lured the huge invasion force of sui emperor yang-ti into a trap at salsu ( cheongcheon ) river , engineering a spectacular victory ( but only deserves a page in book 44 ) in this context , it should be remembered that the compilation of the samguk sagi was an officially sponsored undertaking , commissioned by the goryeo king , with the members of its compilation staff approved by the central bureaucracy in taking on the task of compiling the samguk sagi ( '' compiling '' is more accurate than '' writing '' because much of the history is taken from earlier historical records ) , kim busik was consciously modeling his actions on china imperial traditions , just as he modeled the history ’ s format after its chinese forebears the ideological factors are made manifest in the work 's preface , written by kim busik , where the historian states , : of today ’ s scholars and high-ranking officials , there are those who are well-versed and can discuss in detail the five classics and the other philosophical treatises the great merits of his life were not fought on the battlefield for he was a man who plagued his neighboring countries with secret machinations : moreover the compilers of the samguk sagi turned kim ’ s losses into trifling victories while exaggerating his petty victories : all these distorsions found in the samguk sagi were motivated by a strict adherence to confucianism and a loss of the martial spirit so apparent in the three kingdoms period in contrast , he lifts generously from the chinese dynastic chronicles and even unofficial chinese records , most prominently the wei shu ( 魏書 , book of wei ) , sanguo zhi ( 三國志 ) , jin shu ( 晉書 ) , jiu tangshu ( 舊唐書 , old history of tang ) , xin tangshu ( 新唐書 , new history of tang ) , and the zizhi tongjian ( 資治通鑑 , comprehensive mirror for aid in government ) in any case , it is clear that kim busik 's samguk sagi is critical to the study of korean history during the three kingdoms and unified silla periods kim busik was a patrician of silla origin , and though he himself was a practicing buddhist , he supported confucianism over buddhism as the guiding principle of governance and favored presenting tributes to the chinese emperor to prevent a conflict with china and in deference to the lofty ( sadae ) adopted as well from chinese historiographical tradition was the classic four-part division of the standard dynastic history into annals ( bongi , 本紀 ) , tables ( pyo , 表 ) , monographs ( ji , 志 ) , and biographies ( yeoljeon , 列傳 ) but concerning a possible sadaejuui towards china , one can note ( with mcbride ) : the king said , ‘ the tang forces have destroyed our enemies for us ; and yet , to the contrary , if we make war with them , will heaven help us ? ’ : yusin said , ‘ a dog is scared of its master and yet if the master steps on its legs it will bite him for example , in the jukjuk biography ( book 47 ) , the focus is less about the valor and patriotism of the layman jukjuk himself and more about the misbehaviour of prince kim pumseok , i.e for example , in book 21 ( bojang of goguryeo ) , kim busik praised yang manchun , a commander of goguryeo who defeated emperor taizong of tang at the siege of ansi fortress and called him a hero not only because this work , and its buddhist counterpart samguk yusa , are the only remaining korean sources for the period , but also because the samguk sagi contains a large amount of information and details nevertheless , in the biographies portion , a majority of the subjects are from silla ( 68 % ) , while the silla ’ s scrolls are filled with glorious examples of loyalty and bravery samguk sagi , where sagi ( nowadays 사기 ) was the korean reading of the chinese shǐjì it was with just such intent that goryeo 's king injong tapped kim busik to compile the history of the three kingdoms the dynastic history was written by the succeeding dynasty and the very act of writing it served to illustrate that the succeeding dynasty had inherited the mandate to rule from its predecessor : on the contrary , kim yusin , the arch-hero who deserves books 41 to 43 , was not a famous general endowed with wisdom and bravery , but a politician who was wily and fierce as an eagle as stated earlier , one aspect of its purpose was to educate scholars and officials of the confucianized bureaucracy in their native heritage , and native potential for attaining confucian virtue translation of books 6 and 7 of the silla bongi and eleven of the biographies , mostly of men of silla some korean historians , have criticized of the records provided in the samguk sagi , citing this bias towards china and former silla nowadays known as the records of the grand historian , this work was released circa 100 bce under the more modest title of shǐjì 史記 , i.e
