however , there are two ( or three ) exceptions : in northern germany , there is no continuum in the strict sense between the local indigenous languages and dialects of low german ( '' plattdeutsch '' ) on the one hand , and standard german on the other in german , standard german is generally called , reflecting the fact that its phonetics are largely those of the high german spoken in the southern uplands and the alps ( including austria , switzerland , liechtenstein and south tyrol as well as southern germany ) in german-speaking switzerland , there is no such continuum between the swiss german varieties and swiss standard german , and the use of standard german is almost entirely restricted to the written language however , later the northern pronunciation ( of standard german ) was considered standard and spread southward ; in some regions ( such as around hanover ) , the local dialect has completely died out with the exception of small communities of low german speakers high german and low german are best seen as separate languages , but because high , middle , and low german form a dialect continuum and standard german serves as dachsprache for all forms of german , they are often described as dialects of german all varieties of standard german are based on the common tradition of the written german language , whereas the local dialects have their own historical roots that go further back than the unification of the written language , and in the case of low german , belong to a different language entirely standard german is seldom spoken among native swiss , and even then the accent and vocabulary is very much swiss , except for instance when speaking with people who do not understand the swiss german dialects at all , and it is expected to be used in school for this reason , '' hochdeutsch '' or '' high german '' , originally a mere geographic designation , applies unproblematically to swiss standard german and austrian german as well as to german standard german and may be preferred for that reason standard german is pluricentric with different national varieties , namely : austrian standard german , german standard german , and swiss standard german however , low german did influence the standard-based vernaculars spoken today in northern germany by language transfer ( in pronunciation , vocabulary , grammar , and syntax ) , and it continues to do so to a limited degree the widespread but mistaken impression that hochdeutsch is so-called because it is perceived to be '' good german '' has led to use of the supposedly less judgemental ( '' standard german '' ) , ( '' german standard language '' ) the regular use of dialect in swiss media ( radio , internet , and television ) contrasts with its much rarer appearance in the media of austria , germany , east belgium , south tyrol , and liechtenstein it is often said that the people of hannover speak german with an accent that comes closest to the standard of the duden dictionaries , but the claim is debatable , particularly since it may apply equally well to the rest of northern germany in consequence , the written language of the chancery of saxony-wittenberg rose in importance in the course of the 17th century so much so that it was used in texts such as the 1665 revision of the z√ºrich bible
