in thy work if it is best for us and for thy church that we should be cramped and straitened , let the people 's hands and hearts be closed : if it is better for us ; for the church , —and more to thy glory that we should abound in the comforts of life ; do thou dispose the hearts of those we serve to give accordingly : and may we learn to be content whether we abound , or suffer need '' '' it cost him much to leave home and kindred , as is witnessed by his affectionate letters and sacrificial remittances home : but the call of god was not to be denied '' it is to give up all , and to have my hands and heart in the work , yea , the nearest and dearest friends… '' in his journal he pours out the feelings and impulses of the moment , but often without giving a clue to either the offender or
