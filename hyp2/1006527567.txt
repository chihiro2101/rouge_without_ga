in germany , the idea was referred to as heilige linien ( 'holy lines ' ) , an idea adopted by some proponents of nazism he subsequently began drawing lines across his ordnance survey maps , developing the view that ancient british people had tended to travel in straight lines , using '' mark points '' along the landscape to guide them he put forward his idea of ley lines in the 1922 book early british trackways and then again , in greater depth , in the 1925 book the old straight track & nbsp ; piper 's paper presented to the woolhope naturalists ' field clubb in 1882 , which noted that : '' a line drawn from the ysgyryd fawr mountain northwards to arthur 's stone would pass over the camp and southernmost point of hatterall hill , oldcastle , longtown castle , and urishay and dorstone castles the term ley derived from the old english term for a cleared space , with watkins adopting it for his lines because he found it to be part of the place-names of various settlements that were along the lines he traced his critics noted that the straight lines he proposed would have been highly impractical means of crossing hilly or mountainous terrain , and that many of the sites he selected as evidence for the leys were of disparate historical origins it was in the latter decade of this period that a belief in ley lines was taken up by members of the counterculture , where—in the words of the archaeologist matthew johnson—they were attributed with '' sacred significance or mystical power '' ruggles noted that in this period , ley lines came to be conceived as '' lines of power , the paths of some form of spiritual force or energy accessible to our ancient ancestors but now lost to narrow-minded twentieth-century scientific thought '' in his 1961 book skyways and landmarks , tony wedd published his idea that watkins ' leys were both real and served as ancient markers to guide alien spacecraft that were visiting earth wedd suggested that either spacecraft were following the prehistoric landmarks for guidance or that both the leys and the spacecraft were following a '' magnetic current '' flowing across the earth hutton later noted that michell 's ideas '' embodied a fervent religious feeling , which though not christian was heavily influenced by christian models '' , adopting an '' evangelical and apocalyptic tone '' that announced the coming of an age of aquarius in which ancient wisdom would be restored michell 's publication was followed by an upsurge in ley hunting as enthusiasts travelled around the british landscape seeking to identify what they believed to be ley lines connecting various historic structures it was later edited by paul screeton , who also wrote the book quicksilver heritage , in which he argued that the neolithic period had seen an idyllic society devoted to spirituality but that this was brought to an end through the introduction of metal technologies in the bronze age thom lent the idea of leys some support ; in 1971 he stated the view that neolithic british engineers would have been capable of surveying a straight line between two points that were otherwise not visible from each other he was one of the founding members of the dragon project , launched in london in 1977 with the purpose of conducting radioactivity and ultrasonic tests at prehistoric sites , particularly the stone circles in the british isles and brittany they highlighted that the british landscape was so highly covered in historic monuments that it was statistically unlikely that any straight line could be drawn across the landscape without passing through several such sites they also demonstrated that ley hunters had often claimed that certain markers were neolithic , and thus roughly contemporary with each other , when often they were of widely different dates , such as being iron age or medieval some maintained that even if the presence of earth energies running through ley lines could not be demonstrated with empirical evidence and rational argumentation , this did not matter ; for them , a belief in ley lines was an act of faith , and in their view archaeologists were too narrow-minded to comprehend this reality it laid aside ideas of leys representing channels for earth energy , noting that this was beyond the realm of scientific verification , and instead focused on trying to build a case for ley lines that archaeologists could engage with in particular , it drew attention to ethnographically recorded beliefs in the importance of lines running through the landscape in various communities around the world , proposing these as ethnographic comparisons for what might have occurred in prehistoric britain a prominent example of this was the work of christopher tilley , who devised the idea of phenomenology , or using human senses to experience a landscape as a means of trying to ascertain how past societies would have done the same as hutton observed , a belief in '' ancient earth energies have passed so far into the religious experience of the 'new age ' counter-culture of europe and america that it is unlikely that any tests of evidence would bring about an end to belief in them one criticism of watkins ' ley line theory states that given the high density of historic and prehistoric sites in britain and other parts of europe , finding straight lines that '' connect '' sites is trivial and ascribable to coincidence '' he cited williamson and bellamy 's work in demonstrating this , noting that their research showed how '' the density of archaeological sites in the british landscape is so great that a line drawn through virtually anywhere will 'clip ' a number of sites this , he argued , showed that the mere existence of such lines in a set of points does not prove that the lines are deliberate artefacts , especially since it is known that telephone boxes were not laid out in any such manner or with any such intention in 2004 , john bruno hare wrote : watkins never attributed any supernatural significance to leys ; he believed that they were simply pathways that had been used for trade or ceremonial purposes , very ancient in origin , possibly dating back to the neolithic , certainly pre-roman article by alex whitaker an excerpt from the new ley hunter 's guide by paul devereux moonraking : what does it all mean ? finding places of power : dowsing earth energies the ley hunter magazine 1969–1976 ;
