much like the term '' byzantine '' , which was invented in the 16th century , '' latin empire '' was not a contemporary name used by or for the regime set up by the crusaders of the fourth crusade in constantinople instead , both terms were invented much later by historians seeking to differentiate between the classical period of the roman empire , the medieval period of the byzantine empire , and the late medieval latin empire , all of which called themselves '' roman '' the term '' latin '' has been used by these later historians because the crusaders ( franks , venetians , and other westerners ) were roman catholic and used latin as their liturgical and scholarly language although this is a marked departure from the standard byzantine nomenclature and ideology ( designating the empire as the basileía rhōmaíōn , '' empire of the romans '' ) , imperium constantinopolitanum was the standard name used for the eastern empire in western sources , such as in papal correspondence , and suggests that the latin leaders viewed themselves as “ taking over ” the empire rather than “ replacing ” it nevertheless , the crusaders were well aware of the fact that constantinople was the capital of the roman empire and that the greek-speaking inhabitants of the empire saw themselves as romaioi ( romans ) his title is a near perfect replication of the title used by byzantine emperor alexios iv angelos , placed on the throne by the crusaders previously , in a letter ( only known in its latin version ) to pope innocent iii : fidelis in christo imperator a deo coronatus romanorum moderator et semper augustus , conventiently leaving it open for interpretation whether he referred to romaniae ( '' land of the romans '' ) or romanorum ( '' the romans '' ) 104 baldwin 's successor henry used three different versions of his imperial title ; henricus dei gratia imperator romaniae ( '' emperor of romania '' ) , henricus dei gratia imperator romanorum ( '' emperor of the romans '' ) and henricus dei gratia imperator constantinopolitani ( '' emperor of constantinople '' ) , possibly intended for different recipients usage of the title emperor of constantinople may not just have been to appease the pope and western europe , but might also have been used to legitimize the rule of the latin emperors in regards to the byzantines that they ruled the latin empire claimed the remainder and exerted control over : areas of greece , divided into vassal fiefs : the kingdom of thessalonica the principality of achaea the duchy of athens the duchy of the archipelago the short-lived duchy of philippopolis in north thrace further duchies were projected in asia minor , at nicaea ( for louis of blois ) , nicomedia ( thierry de loos ) , alasehir ( stephen du perche ) , and neokastra the doge of venice did not rank as a vassal to the latin empire , but his position in control of three-eighths of its territory and of parts of constantinople itself ensured venice 's influence in the empire 's affairs however , much of the former byzantine territory remained in the hands of rival successor states led by byzantine greek aristocrats , such as the despotate of epirus , the empire of nicaea , and the empire of trebizond , each bent on reconquest from the latins the crowning of baldwin i ( 16 may 1204 ) and the establishment of the latin empire had the curious effect of creating five simultaneously existing entities claiming to be successors of the roman empire : the latin empire , the holy roman empire , and the three remnants of the byzantine empire , the despotate of epirus , the empire of nicaea , and the empire of trebizond at the battle of poimanenon in 1224 , the latin army was defeated , and by the next year emperor robert of courtenay was forced to cede all his asian possessions to nicaea , except for nicomedia and the territories directly across from constantinople kaloyan was murdered a couple of years later ( 1207 ) during a siege of thessaloniki , and the bulgarian threat conclusively defeated with a victory the following year , which allowed baldwin 's successor , henry of flanders , to reclaim most of the lost territories in thrace until 1210 , when peace was concluded with the marriage of henry to maria of bulgaria , tsar kaloyan 's daughter distracted by the renewed war with nicaea , and waiting in vain for assistance from pope honorius iii and the king of france philip ii , the latin empire was unable to prevent the final fall of thessalonica to epirus in 1224 in order to raise funds , he was forced to resort to desperate means , from removing the lead roofs of the great palace and selling them , to handing over his only son , philip , to venetian merchants as a guarantee for a loan thus , on 25 july 1261 , with most of the latin troops away on campaign , the nicaean general alexios strategopoulos found an unguarded entrance to the city , and entered it with 800 troops only , restoring the byzantine empire for his master , michael viii palaiologos for about a century thereafter , the heirs of baldwin ii continued to use the title of emperor of constantinople , and were seen as the overlords of the various remaining latin states in the aegean
