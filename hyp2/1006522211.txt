visual techniques such as smoke signals , beacon , hydraulic telegraphs , ship flags and semaphore lines were the earliest forms of optical communication when a signaler tilts the mirror to reflect sunlight , the distant observer sees flashes of light that can be used to transmit a prearranged signaling code a semaphore line , also called a 'semaphore line ' , 'optical telegraph ' , 'shutter telegraph chain ' , 'chappe telegraph ' , or 'napoleonic semaphore ' , is a system used for conveying information by means of visual signals , using towers with pivoting arms or shutters , also known as blades or paddles information is encoded by the position of the mechanical elements ; it is read when the shutter is in a fixed position the maximum distance that a pair of semaphore telegraph stations can bridge is limited by geography , weather and the availability of light ; thus , in practical use , most optical telegraphs used lines of relay stations to bridge longer distances the first operational optical semaphore line arrived in 1792 , created by the french engineer claude chappe and his brothers , who succeeded in covering france with a network of 556 stations stretching a total distance of flag semaphore are the system for conveying information at a distance by means of visual signals with hand-held flags , rods , disks , paddles , or occasionally bare or gloved hands information is encoded by the position of the flags , objects or arms ; it is read when they are in a fixed position at sea , the flags are colored red and yellow ( the oscar flags ) , while on land , they are white and blue ( the papa flags ) signal lamps ( such as aldis lamps ) , are visual signaling devices for optical communication ( typically using morse code ) in large versions this pulse is achieved by opening and closing shutters mounted in front of the lamp , either via a manually operated pressure switch or , in later versions , automatically aviation light signals are used in the case of a nordo , an aircraft not equipped with a radio , or in the case of a hearing-impaired pilot these colors may be flashing or steady , and provide different instructions to aircraft in flight or on the ground ( for example , '' cleared to land '' or '' cleared for takeoff '' ) only 12 simple standardized instructions are directed at aircraft using signal light guns as the system is not utilized with morse code a heliograph helios , meaning '' sun '' , and graphein , meaning '' write '' ) is a wireless solar telegraph that signals by flashes of sunlight ( generally using morse code ) reflected by a mirror fiber-optic communication cables are now employed to send the great majority of the electronic data and long distance telephone calls that are not conveyed by either radio , terrestrial microwave or satellite the photophone ( originally given an alternate name , radiophone ) is a communication device which allowed for the transmission of speech on a beam of light on june 21 , 1880 , bell 's assistant transmitted a wireless voice telephone message of considerable distance , from the roof of the franklin school to the window of bell 's laboratory , some 213 meters ( about 700 & nbsp ; ft ) away of the 18 patents granted in bell 's name alone , and the 12 he shared with his collaborators , four were for the photophone , which bell referred to as his 'greatest achievement , telling a reporter shortly before his death that the photophone was '' the greatest invention i have ever made , greater than the telephone '' free-space optics ( fso ) systems are employed for 'last mile ' telecommunications and can function over distances of several kilometers as long as there is a clear line of sight between the source and the destination , and the optical receiver can reliably decode the transmitted information
