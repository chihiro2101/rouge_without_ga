the orientation of the substrate and the close proximity between it and the active site is so important that in some cases the enzyme can still function properly even though all other parts are mutated and lose function there are four important types of interaction that hold the substrate in a defined orientation and form an enzyme-substrate complex ( es complex ) : hydrogen bonds , van der waals force , hydrophobic interactions and electrostatic interactions for example , alcohol dehydrogenase which catalyses the transfer of a hydride ion from ethanol to nadh interacts with the substrate methyl group , hydroxyl group and the pro- ( r ) hydrogen that will be abstracted during the reaction in order to exert their function , enzymes need to assume their correct protein fold ( native fold ) and tertiary structure a tighter fit between an active site and the substrate molecule is believed to increase the efficiency of a reaction if the tightness between the active site of dna polymerase and its substrate is increased , the fidelity , which means the correct rate of dna replication will also increase apart from competitive inhibition , this theory can not explain the mechanism of action of non-competitive inhibition either , as they do not bind to the active site but nevertheless influence catalytic activity daniel koshland 's theory of enzyme-substrate binding is that the active site and the binding portion of the substrate are not exactly complementary the induced fit model is a development of the lock-and-key model and assumes that an active site is flexible and changes shape until the substrate is completely bound this model suggests that enzymes exist in a variety of conformations , only some of which are capable of binding to a substrate when a substrate is bound to the protein , the equilibrium in the conformational ensemble shifts towards those able to bind ligands ( as enzymes with bound substrates are removed from the equilibrium between the free conformations ) electrostatic interaction : in an aqueous environment , the oppositely charged groups in amino acid side chains within the active site and substrates attract each other , which is termed electrostatic interaction although the individual force is weak , as the total number of interactions between the active site and substrate is massive the sum of them will be significant the residues of the catalytic site are typically very close to the binding site , and some residues can have dual-roles in both binding and catalysis catalytic residues of the site interact with the substrate to lower the activation energy of a reaction and thereby make it proceed faster in solution substrate molecules are surrounded by solvent molecules and energy is required for enzyme molecules to replace them and contact with the substrate next , the active site is designed to reorient the substrate to reduce the activation energy for the reaction to occur the alignment of the substrate , after binding , is locked in a high energy state and can proceed to the next step in addition , this binding is favoured by entropy as the energy cost associated with solution reaction is largely eliminated since solvent can not enter active site in the end , the active site may manipulate the molecular orbital of the substrate into a suitable orientation to reduce activation energy many enzymes including serine protease , cysteine protease , protein kinase and phosphatase evolved to form transient covalent bonds between them and their substrates to lower the activation energy and allow the reaction to occur nucleophilic catalysis : this process involves the donation of electrons from the enzyme 's nucleophile to a substrate to form a covalent bond between them during the transition state the former one is mainly affected by the basicity ( the ability to donate electron pairs ) of the species while the later one is in regard to its pk a electrophilic catalysis : the mechanism behind this process is exactly same as nucleophilic catalysis except that now amino acids in active site act as electrophile while substrates are nucleophiles the easiest way to distinguish between them is to check whether the reaction rate is determined by the concentrations of the general acid and base since most enzymes have an optimum ph of 6 to 7 , the amino acids in the side chain usually have a pk a of 4~10 and there is an obvious paradox : in reversible enzymatic reaction if the active site perfectly fits the substrates then the backward reaction will be slowed since products can not fit perfectly into the active site this theory is a little similar to the lock and key theory , but at this time the active site is preprogrammed to bind perfectly to substrate in transition state rather than in ground state during this process , its thiol side chain is oxidised and two glutathione molecules are connected by a disulphide bond to form a dimer ( gssg ) in the active site , there are two cysteine residues besides the fad cofactor and are used to break the disulphide bond during the catalytic reaction in the active site of this enzyme , three amino acid residues work together to form a catalytic triad which makes up the catalytic site the nucleophilicity of ser-195 is enhanced by his-57 , which abstracts a proton from ser-195 and is in turn stabilised by the negatively charged carboxylate group ( rcoo âˆ’ ) in asp-102 larger ligands generally stay in the active site longer , as do those with more rotatable bonds ( although this may be a side effect of size ) on the other hand , it can form semiquinone ( free radical ) by accepting one electron , and then converts to fully reduced form by the addition of an extra electron they usually bind to a different site on the enzyme and alter the 3-dimensional structure of the active site to block substrates from entry or leaving the enzyme thumb an regulatory site is a site on an enzyme , unrelated to its active site , which can bind an effector molecule
