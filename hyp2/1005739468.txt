it seems that reversible and heritable changes can occur without a change in dna sequence ( genotype ) and that such changes may be induced spontaneously or in response to environmental factorsâ€”lamarck 's '' acquired traits instead , lamarck '' argued that the environment created needs to which organisms responded by using some features more and others less , that this resulted in those features being accentuated or attenuated , and that this difference was then inherited by offspring in 2007 , david haig wrote that research into epigenetic processes does allow a lamarckian element in evolution but the processes do not challenge the main tenets of the modern evolutionary synthesis as modern lamarckians have claimed haig has written that there is a '' visceral attraction '' to lamarckian evolution from the public and some scientists , as it posits the world with a meaning , in which organisms can shape their own evolutionary destiny gissis and eva jablonka , mit press , 2011 '' thomas dickens and qazi rahman ( 2012 ) have argued that epigenetic mechanisms such as dna methylation and histone modification are genetically inherited under the control of natural selection and do not challenge the modern synthesis '' also in 2015 , adam weiss argued that bringing back lamarck in the context of epigenetics is misleading , commenting , '' we should remember lamarck for the good he contributed to science , not for things that resemble his theory only superficially the messenger rna products of these somatically novel genes were captured by retroviruses endogenous to the b-cells and were then transported through the bloodstream where they could breach the weismann or soma-germ barrier and reverse transcribe the newly acquired genes into the cells of the germ line , in the manner of darwin 's pangenes bowler noted in 1989 that other scientists had been unable to reproduce his results , and described the scientific consensus at the time : bowler commented that '' steele 's work was bitterly criticized at the time by biologists who doubted his experimental results and rejected his hypothetical mechanism as implausible the hologenome can vary like any other genome by mutation , sexual recombination , and chromosome rearrangement , but in addition it can vary when populations of microorganisms increase or decrease ( resembling lamarckian use and disuse ) , and when it gains new kinds of microorganism ( resembling lamarckian inheritance of acquired characteristics ) the mechanism is largely uncontroversial , and natural selection does sometimes occur at whole system ( hologenome ) level , but it is not clear that this is always the case the baldwin effect , named after the psychologist james mark baldwin by george gaylord simpson in 1953 , proposes that the ability to learn new behaviours can improve an animal 's reproductive success , and hence the course of natural selection on its genetic makeup
