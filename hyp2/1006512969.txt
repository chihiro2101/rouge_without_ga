the amount of sewage sludge produced is proportional to the amount and concentration of wastewater treated , and it also depends on the type of wastewater treatment process used the total sludge production from a wastewater treatment process is the sum of sludge from primary settling tanks ( if they are part of the process configuration ) plus excess sludge from the biological treatment step of the biological treatment processes , the activated sludge process produces about 70–100 & nbsp ; kg/ml of waste activated sludge , and a trickling filter process produces slightly less sludge from the biological part of the process : 60–100 & nbsp ; kg/ml this means that the total sludge production of an activated sludge process that uses primary sedimentation tanks is in the range of 180–270 & nbsp ; kg/ml , being the sum of primary sludge and waste activated sludge some highlights include : lead , arsenic , chromium , and cadmium are estimated by the epa to be present in chemical analysis in 100 % of national sewage sludges in the us , while thallium is only estimated to be present in 94.1 % of sludges silver is present to the degree of 20 & nbsp ; mg/kg of sludge , on average , while some sludges have up to 200 milligrams of silver per kilogram of sludge ; one outlier demonstrated a silver lode of 800–900 & nbsp ; mg per kg of sludge '' a pollutant is an organic substance , an inorganic substance , a combination of organic and inorganic substances , or a pathogenic organism that , after discharge and upon exposure , ingestion , inhalation , or assimilation into an organism either directly from the environment or indirectly by ingestion through the food chain , could , on the basis of information available to the administrator of epa , cause death , disease , mental disorders , cancer , teratogens , physiological malfunctions ( including malfunction in reproduction ) , or deformity in either organisms or birth defect sewage sludge is produced from the wastewater treatment in sewage treatment plants and consists of two basic forms — raw primary sludge and secondary sludge , also known as activated sludge in the case of the activated sludge process sewage sludge is usually treated by one or several of the following treatment steps : lime stabilization , thickening , dewatering , drying , anaerobic digestion or composting some treatment processes , such as composting and alkaline stabilization , that involve significant amendments may affect contaminant strength and concentration : depending on the process and the contaminant in question , treatment may decrease or in some cases increase the bioavailability and/or solubility of contaminants kelessidis and stasinakis , 2012 following treatment , sewage sludge is either landfilled , dumped in the ocean , incinerated , applied on agricultural land or , in some cases , retailed or given away for free to the general public according to a review article published in 2012 , sludge reuse ( including direct agricultural application and composting ) was the predominant choice for sludge management in eu-15 ( 53 % of produced sludge ) , following by incineration ( 21 % of produced sludge ) in the united states , the following classes of sewage sludge after treatment are defined : class a sludge is typically dried and pasteurized , and is also known as '' exceptional '' quality after treatment , and dependent upon the quality of sludge produced ( for example with regards to heavy metal content ) , sewage sludge is most commonly either disposed of in landfills , dumped in the ocean or applied to land for its fertilizing properties , as pioneered by the product milorganite it used to be common practice to dump sewage sludge into the ocean , however , this practice has stopped in many nations due to environmental concerns as well to domestic and international laws and treaties biosolids is a term widely used to denote the byproduct of domestic and commercial sewage treatment that is to be used in agriculture treated biosolids can be produced in cake , granular , pellet , or liquid form and are spread over land before being incorporated into the soil or injected directly into the soil by specialist contractors the findings of a 20-year field study of air , land , and water in arizona , concluded that use of biosolids is sustainable and improves the soil and crops the impact of this persistence in soils is unknown , but the link to human and land animal health is likely tied to the capacity for plants to absorb and accumulate these chemicals in their consumed tissues treated sewage sludge has been used in the uk , europe and china agriculturally for more than 80 years , though there is increasing pressure in some countries to stop the practice of land application due to farm land contamination and public outrage pyrolysis of the sludge to create syngas and potentially biochar is possible , as is combustion of biofuel produced from drying sewage sludge or incineration in a waste-to-energy facility for direct production of electricity and steam for district heating or industrial uses in addition , the ash produced by incineration or incomplete combustion processes ( such as fluidized-bed dryers ) may be difficult to use without subsequent treatment due to high heavy metal content ; solutions to this include leaching of the ashes to remove heavy metals or in the case of ash produced in a complete-combustion process , or with biochar produced from a pyrolytic process , the heavy metals may be fixed in place and the ash material readily usable as a leeds preferred additive to concrete or asphalt examples of other ways to use dried sewage sludge as an energy resource include the gate 5 energy system , an innovative process to power a steam turbine using heat from burning milled and dried sewage sludge , or combining dried sewage sludge with coal in coal-fired power stations a sample of 437 people exposed to class b sludge ( living within of sludged land ) - and using a control group of 176 people not exposed to sludge ( not living within of sludged land ) reported the following : although cum hoc ergo propter hoc , such extensive correlations may lead reasonable people to conclude that precaution is necessary in dealing with sludge and sludged farmlands '' they further suggest that even class a treated sludge may have chemical contaminants ( including heavy metals , such as lead ) or endotoxins present , and a precautionary approach may be justified on this basis , though the vast majority of incidents reported by lewis , et al a 2005 report by the state of north carolina concluded that '' a surveillance program of humans living near application sites should be developed to determine if there are adverse health effects in humans and animals as a result of biosolids application the european commission has said repeatedly that the '' directive on the protection of the environment , and in particular of the soil , when sewage sludge is used in agriculture '' ( 86/278/eec ) has been very successful in that there have been no cases of adverse effect where it has been applied this increase in the amount of sewage sludge accumulation in the eu can be due to the increase in the number of households that are connected to the sewage system the eu has directives in place to encourage the use of sewage sludge in agriculture , in a way that will not harm the soil , humans , and the environment are not harmed in austria , in order to dispose of the sewage sludge in a landfill , it must first be treated in a way that reduces its biological reactivity biosolids that meet the class b pathogen treatment and pollutant criteria , in accordance with the epa '' standards for the use or disposal of sewage sludge '' ( 40 cfr part 503 ) , can be land applied with formal site restrictions and strict record keeping this is probably the greatest issue with the practice : under both the federal program operated by the epa and those of the several states , there is limited inspection and oversight by agencies charged with regulating these practices in the case of new york city , at first the sludge was discharged directly along the banks of rivers surrounding the city , then later piped further into the rivers , and then further still out into the harbor the wider question is whether or not changes on the sea floor caused by the portion of sludge that settles are severe enough to justify the added operational cost and human health concerns of applying sludge to land the epa 's part 503 regulations were developed with input from university , epa , and usda researchers from around the country and involved an extensive review of the scientific literature and the largest risk assessment the agency had conducted to that time
