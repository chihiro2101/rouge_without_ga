however , the most famous of these was the central region of the peninsula roughly bounded on the west by the mountains of the hejaz and yemen and to the east by the historical region of eastern arabia and the north by iraq and syria 68 the emergence of what was to become the saudi royal family , known as the al saud , began in nejd in central arabia in 1744 , when muhammad bin saud , founder of the dynasty , joined forces with the religious leader muhammad ibn abd al-wahhab , bowen , pp the most prominent among these provinces are al-'aridh , which includes riyadh and the historical saudi capital of diriyah ; al-qassim , with its capital in buraidah ; sudair , centered on al majma'ah ; al-washm , centered on shaqraa ; and jebel shammar , with its capital , ha'il on the eve of the formation of saudi arabia , the major nomadic tribes of najd included dawasir , mutayr , 'utaybah , shammar ( historically known as tayy ) subay ' , suhool , harb , and the qahtanites in southern najd also important are the various dry river-beds ( wadis ) such as wadi hanifa near riyadh , wadi na'am in the south , wadi al-rumah in the al-qassim province in the north , and wadi ad-dawasir at the southernmost tip of najd on the border with najran the most famous najdi tribes in the pre-islamic era were banu hanifa , who occupied the area around modern-day riyadh , banu tamim , who occupied areas further north , the tribe of banu abs who were centered in al-qassim , the tribe of tayy , centered on modern-day ha'il , and the tribe of banu 'amir in southern najd medieval muslim geographers spent a great amount of time debating the exact boundaries between hejaz and najd in particular , but generally set the western boundaries of najd to be wherever the western mountain ranges and lava beds began to slope eastwards , and set the eastern boundaries of najd at the narrow strip of red sand dunes known as the ad-dahna desert , some east of modern-day riyadh in the early islamic centuries , najd was considered to extend as far north as the river euphrates , or more specifically , the '' walls of khosrau '' , constructed by the sassanid empire as a barrier between arabia and iraq immediately prior to the advent of islam riyadh is the largest city in najd , as well as the largest city in the country as a whole , with a population of more than 5,700,000 in 2010 and 5,008,100 in 2016 the main topographical features include the twin mountains of aja and salma in the north near ha'il , the high land of jabal shammar and the tuwaiq mountain range running through its center from north to south under modern-day saudi arabia , however , najd is divided into three administrative regions : ha'il , al-qassim , and riyadh , comprising a combined area of donner , '' muhammad and the believers : at the origins of islam '' , harvard university press , 2010 , the ansar , the leaders of the tribes of medina , met in a hall or house called saqifah , to discuss whom they would support as their new leader from the 10th century to the early 20th century mecca and medina were under the control of a local arab ruler known as the sharif of mecca , but at most times the sharif owed allegiance to the ruler of one of the major islamic empires based in baghdad , cairo or istanbul since the formation of modern saudi arabia , najd , and particularly riyadh , has seen an influx of immigrants from all regions of the country and from virtually every social class in 1916 , with the encouragement and support of britain ( which was fighting the ottomans in world war i ) , the sharif of mecca , hussein bin ali , led a arab revolt against the ottoman empire to create a united arab state the rest of the population consisted mainly of arabs who were , for various reasons , unaffiliated with any tribes , and who mostly lived in the towns and villages of najd working in various trades such as carpentry or as sonnaa ( artisan ) the southern border of najd has always been set at the large sea of sand dunes known today as rub ' al khali ( the empty quarter ) , while the southwestern boundaries are marked by the valleys of wadi ranyah , wadi bisha , and wadi tathlith at buzakha in north central arabia , another claimed prophet , tulaiha , a tribal chief of bani asad , led the rebellion against medina aided by the allied tribes of banu ghatfan , the hawazin , and the tayy the najdi arabic is seen by some to be the least foreign-influenced of all modern arabic dialects , due to the isolated location and harsh climate of the najdi plateau , as well as the apparent absence of any substratum from a previous language most of the nomadic tribes are now settled either in cities such as riyadh , or in special settlements , known as hijras , that were established in the early part of the 20th century as part of a country-wide policy undertaken by ibn saud to put an end to nomadic life the founder of the strict interpretation of islam called wahhabism followed by the house of saud , muhammad ibn abd al-wahhab was born in 'uyayna , a village in the najd prior to the formation of the modern kingdom of saudi arabia , the native population arabs , who were either nomads ( bedouins ) , or sedentary farmers and merchants about a quarter of the population of najd , including about a third of the population of riyadh , are non-saudi expatriates , including both skilled professionals and unskilled laborers the variation , however , is far less pronounced in najd than it is elsewhere in the country , and the najdi sedentary dialect seems to be descended from the arabic dialects , just as most sedentary najdis are descendants of nomadic bedouins themselves retrieved from throughout the rest of the 19th century , the al saud contested control of the interior of what was to become saudi arabia with another arabian ruling family , the al rashid at najd , getting the news of khalid 's decisive victories against apostates in buzakha , many clans of banu tamim hastened to visit khalid , but the banu yarbu ' , a branch of bani tamim , under their chief , malik ibn nuwayrah , hung back banu asad ibn khuzaymah tribe ( not to be confused with the banu asad tribe ) , were the residents of katan , in the vicinity of fayd , was a powerful tribe connected with the quraysh جريدة الرياض – عين على القصيم smaller towns and villages include sudair , al-kharj , dawadmi , 'afif , al-zilfi , al majma'ah , shaqraa , tharmada ' a , dhurma , al-gway'iyyah , al-hareeq , hotat bani tamim , layla , as sulayyil , and wadi ad-dawasir , the southernmost settlement in najd the combined force of muslims , now 13,000 strong , defeated musaylima 's army in the battle of yamama , which was fought in the third week of december nothing could be done about the tribes of bani assad and banu ghatafan , which stood solidly behind tulayha , but the tayy were not so staunch in their support of tulayha , and their chief , adi ibn hatim , was a devout muslim at the same time , the ikhwan became disenchanted with ibn saud 's domestic policies which appeared to favor modernization and the increase in the number of non-muslim foreigners in the country in the 5th and 6th centuries ad , the kindites made the first real concerted effort to unite all the tribes of central arabia through alliances , and focused on wars with the lakhmids muhammad 's followers rapidly expanded the territory under muslim rule beyond arabia , muslim conquests ( from the iberian peninsula in west to modern day pakistan in east ) in a matter of decades after the conquest of the hejaz , the ikhwan leadership 's objective switched to expansion of the wahhabist realm into the british protectorates of transjordan , iraq and kuwait , and began raiding those territories by the 20th century , many of the ancient tribes had morphed into new confederations or emigrated from other areas of the middle east , and many tribes from other regions of the peninsula had moved into najd the ghassanids , lakhmids and kindah were all kahlani and qaḥṭānī vassal kingdoms appointed by the byzantines , persians and ḥimyarites to protect their borders and imperial interests from the raids of the then-rising threat of the 'adnānī tribes as in other regions of the peninsula , there is a divergence between the dialect of the nomadic bedouins and the dialect of the sedentary townspeople in the 16th century , the ottomans added the red sea and persian gulf coast ( the hejaz , asir and al-ahsa ) to the empire and claimed suzerainty over the interior he wrote the details of his actions to abu bakr , who , both pained and angered by the rashness of ikrimah and his disobedience , ordered him to proceed with his force to oman to assist hudaifa ; once hudaifa had completed his task , to march to mahra to help arfaja , and thereafter go to yemen to help muhajir in the 15th through 18th centuries , there was considerable tribal influx from the west , increasing both the nomadic and settled population of the area and providing fertile soil for the wahhabi movement the most authentic opinion according to '' saifur rahman al mubararakpuri '' , however , is that dhat ar-riqa ‘ campaign took place after the fall of khaibar ( and not as part of the invasion of nejd )
