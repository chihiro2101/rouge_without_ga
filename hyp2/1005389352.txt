nbg and zfc are equivalent set theories in the sense that any theorem not mentioning classes and provable in one theory can be proved in the other because there are non-well-founded models that satisfy each axiom of zfc except the axiom of regularity , that axiom is independent of the other zfc axioms forcing proves that the following statements are independent of zfc : continuum hypothesis diamondsuit suslin 's problem martin 's axiom ( which is not a zfc axiom ) axiom of constructibility ( which is also not a zfc axiom ) this method can prove that the existence of large cardinals is not provable in zfc , but can not prove that assuming such cardinals , given zfc , is free of contradiction mathematicians currently debate which axioms are the most plausible or '' self-evident '' , which axioms are the most useful in various domains , and about to what degree usefulness should be traded off with plausibility ; some '' multiverse '' set theorists argue that usefulness should be the sole ultimate criterion in which axioms to customarily adopt one school of thought leans on expanding the '' iterative '' concept of a set to produce a set-theoretic universe with an interesting and complex but reasonably tractable structure by adopting forcing axioms ; another school advocates for a tidier , less cluttered universe , perhaps focused on a '' core '' inner model : for criticism of set theory in general , see objections to set theory zfc has been criticized both for being excessively strong and for being excessively weak , as well as for its failure to capture objects such as proper classes and the universal set some of '' mainstream mathematics '' ( mathematics not directly connected with axiomatic set theory ) is beyond peano arithmetic and second-order arithmetic , but still , all such mathematics can be carried out in zc ( zermelo set theory with choice ) , another theory weaker than zfc much of the power of zfc , including the axiom of regularity and the axiom schema of replacement , is included primarily to facilitate the study of the set theory itself unlike von neumann–bernays–gödel set theory ( nbg ) and morse–kelley set theory ( mk ) , zfc does not admit the existence of proper classes a further comparative weakness of zfc is that the axiom of choice included in zfc is weaker than the axiom of global choice included in nbg and mk the mizar system and metamath have adopted tarski–grothendieck set theory , an extension of zfc , so that proofs involving grothendieck universes ( encountered in category theory and algebraic geometry ) can be formalized .
