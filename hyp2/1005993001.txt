andrew brennan was an advocate of ecologic humanism ( eco-humanism ) , the argument that all ontological entities , animate and inanimate , can be given ethical worth purely on the basis that they exist deep ecology is the argument for the intrinsic value or inherent worth of the environment – the view that it is valuable in itself singer found it difficult to accept the argument from intrinsic worth of a-biotic or '' non-sentient '' ( non-conscious ) entities , and concluded in his first edition of '' practical ethics '' that they should not be included in the expanding circle of moral worth however , in a later edition of '' practical ethics '' after the work of næss and sessions , singer admits that , although unconvinced by deep ecology , the argument from intrinsic value of non-sentient entities is plausible , but at best problematic whereas libertarian extension can be thought of as flowing from a political reflection of the natural world , ecologic extension is best thought of as a scientific reflection of the natural world ecological extension is roughly the same classification of smith 's eco-holism , and it argues for the intrinsic value inherent in collective ecological entities like ecosystems or the global environment as a whole entity the planet is characterized as a unified , holism entity with ethical worth of which the human race is of no particular significance in the long run it contrasts the intrinsic value ideas of 'deep ecology , ' hence is often referred to as 'shallow ecology , ' and generally argues for the preservation of the environment on the basis that it has extrinsic value – instrumental to the welfare of human beings it could be argued that it is this ethic that formed the underlying arguments proposed by governments at the kyoto summit in 1997 and three agreements reached in the earth summit in 1992 their preservation is a bequest for future generations as they have been inherited from human 's ancestors and should be passed down to future generations so they can have the opportunity to decide whether to enjoy unspoilt countryside or an entirely urban landscape environmental health ( deuteronomy 22.8 ; 23.12-14 ) - and dynamic motivation , the love of christ controlling ( 2 corinthians 5.14f ) and dealing with the underlying spiritual disease of sin , which shows itself in selfishness and thoughtlessness in order to solidify the understanding that god had intended for humankind to use earths natural resources , environmental writers and religious scholars alike proclaimed that humans are separate from nature , on a higher order those that may critique this point of view may ask the same question that john muir asks ironically in a section of his novel a thousand mile walk to the gulf , why are there so many dangers in the natural world in the form of poisonous plants , animals and natural disasters , the answer is that those creatures are a result of adam and eve 's sins in the garden of eden detractors of anthropocentrism argue that the western tradition biases homo sapiens when considering the environmental ethics of a situation and that humans evaluate their environment or other organisms in terms of the utility for them ( see speciesism ) in fact , based on this very assumption , a philosophical article has explored recently the possibility of humans ' willing extinction as a gesture toward other beings likewise , it is possible that a human-centred or anthropocentric/androcentric ethic is not an accurate depiction of reality , and there is a bigger picture that humans may or may not be able to understand from a human perspective weak anthropocentrism , however , argues that reality can only be interpreted from a human point of view , thus humans have to be at the centre of reality as they see it in germany , the university of greifswald has recently established an international program in landscape ecology & nature conservation with a strong focus on environmental ethics in 2009 , the university of munich and deutsches museum founded the rachel carson center for environment and society , an international , interdisciplinary center for research and education in the environmental humanities differing conceptions of the treatment of and obligations towards animals , particularly those living in the wild , within animal ethics and environmental ethics has been a source of controversy between the two ethical positions ; some ethicists have asserted that the two positions are incompatible , while others have argued that these disagreements can be overcome bioethics literature database brief history of environmental ethics thesaurus ethics in the life sciences envirolink library : environmental ethics - online resource for environmental ethics information envirolink forum - environmental ethics discussion/debate environmental ethics online ( journal , 1979-present ) sustainable and ethical architecture architectural firm stanford encyclopedia of philosophy environmental ethics entry in the internet encyclopedia of philosophy center for environmental philosophy unt dept of philosophy creation care reading room : extensive online resources for environment and faith ( tyndale seminary ) category list -- - religion-online.org '' ecology/environment '' islam , christianity and the environment
