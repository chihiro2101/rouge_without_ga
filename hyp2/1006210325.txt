it is thought that the proper name ti'amat , which is the construct or vocative form , was dropped in secondary translations of the original texts because some akkadian copyists of enûma elish substituted the ordinary word tāmtu ( '' sea '' ) for tiamat , the two names having become essentially the same due to association the babylonian epic enuma elish is named for its incipit : '' when above '' the heavens did not yet exist nor the earth below , apsu the subterranean ocean was there , '' the first , the begetter '' , and tiamat , the overground sea , '' she who bore them all '' ; they were '' mixing their waters '' it is thought that female deities are older than male ones in mesopotamia and tiamat may have begun as part of the cult of nammu , a female principle of a watery creative force , with equally strong connections to the underworld , which predates the appearance of ea-enki this characteristic is especially true of the region of bahrain , whose name in arabic means '' two seas '' , and which is thought to be the site of dilmun , the original site of the sumerian creation beliefs in the enûma elish her physical description includes a tail , a thigh , '' lower parts '' ( which shake together ) , a belly , an udder , ribs , a neck , a head , a skull , eyes , nostrils , a mouth , and lips '' the enûma elish states that tiamat gave birth to dragons and serpents among a more general list of monsters including scorpion men and mermaid , but does not identify her form as that of a dragon ; however , other sources containing the same myth do refer to her as such the depiction of tiamat ( dungeons & dragons ) was popularized in the 1970s as a fixture of the dungeons & dragons roleplaying game inspired by earlier sources associating tiamat with later mythological characters such as lotan ( leviathan ) lahmu and lahamu , in turn , were the parents of the 'ends ' of the heavens ( anshar , from an-šar heaven-totality/end ) and the earth ( kishar ) ; anshar and kishar were considered to meet at the horizon , becoming , thereby , the parents of anu ( heaven ) and ki ( earth ) in the myth recorded on cuneiform , the deity enki ( later ea ) believed correctly that apsu was planning to murder the younger deities , upset with the noisy tumult they created , and so captured him and held him prisoner beneath his temple , the e-abzu ( '' temple of abzu '' ) tiamat possessed the tablet of destinies and in the primordial battle she gave them to kingu , the deity she had chosen as her lover and the leader of her host , and who was also one of her children kingu was captured and later was slain : his red blood mixed with the red clay of the earth would make the body of humankind , created to act as the servant of the younger igigi deities '' this surmise that the babylonian version of the story is based upon a modified version of an older epic , in which enlil , not marduk , was the god who slew tiamat , expressed , for example , in e it is generally accepted amongst modern assyriologists that the enûma elish—the babylonian creation epic to which this mythological strand is attributed—was written as babylonian political and religious propaganda rather than reflecting a sumerian tradition ; the dating of the epic is not completely clear , but judging from the mythological topics covered and the cuneiform versions discovered thus far , it is likely to date to the 15th century bce martkheel according to some analyses there are two parts to the tiamat myth , the first in which tiamat is creator goddess , through a '' sacred marriage '' between different waters , peacefully creating the cosmos through successive generations
