pure poly ( methyl methacrylate ) homopolymer is rarely sold as an end product , since it is not optimized for most applications for example , a small amount of acrylate comonomers are routinely used in pmma grades destined for heat processing , since this stabilizes the polymer to depolymerization ( '' unzipping '' ) during processing plasticizers may be added to improve processing properties , lower the glass transition temperature , improve impact properties , and improve mechanical properties such as elastic modulus dyes may be added to give color for decorative applications , or to protect against ( or filter ) uv light the polymer of methyl acrylate , pma or poly ( methyl acrylate ) , is similar to poly ( methyl methacrylate ) , except for the lack of methyl groups on the backbone carbon chain being transparent and durable , pmma is a versatile material and has been used in a wide range of fields and applications such as rear-lights and instrument clusters for vehicles , appliances , and lenses for glasses pmma in the form of sheets affords to shatter resistant panels for building windows , skylights , bulletproof security barriers , signs & displays , sanitary ware ( bathtubs ) , lcd screens , furniture and many other applications light pipes : an innovative design device for bringing natural daylight and illumination into buildings with deep floor plan , nomination for the far east economic review asian innovation awards 2003 their developers veronica garcia hansen , ken yeang , and ian edmonds were awarded the far east economic review innovation award in bronze for this technology in 2003 lighting up your workplace – queensland student pipes light to your office cubicle , may 9 , 2005 kenneth yeang , world cities summit 2008 , june 23–25 , 2008 , singapore attenuation being quite strong for distances over one meter ( more than 90 % intensity loss for a 3000 & nbsp ; k source ) , acrylic broadband light guides are then dedicated mostly to decorative uses such panels have been commercialized for purposes of daylighting , to be used as a window or a canopy such that sunlight descending from the sky is directed to the ceiling or into the room rather than to the floor this can lead to a higher illumination of the back part of a room , in particular when combined with a white ceiling , while having a slight impact on the view to the outside compared to normal glazing pmma has a good degree of compatibility with human tissue , and it is used in the manufacture of rigid intraocular lenses which are implanted in the eye when the original lens has been removed in the treatment of cataracts this compatibility was discovered by the english ophthalmologist sir harold ridley in wwii raf pilots , whose eyes had been riddled with pmma splinters coming from the side windows of their supermarine spitfire fighters – the plastic scarcely caused any rejection , compared to glass splinters coming from aircraft such as the hawker hurricane due to its aforementioned biocompatibility , poly ( methyl methacrylate ) is a commonly used material in modern dentistry , particularly in the fabrication of dental prosthetics , artificial teeth , and orthodontic appliances ; acrylic prosthetic construction : pre-polymerized , powdered pmma spheres are mixed with a methyl methacrylate liquid monomer , benzoyl peroxide ( initiator ) , and nn-dimethyl-p-toluidine ( accelerator ) , and placed under heat and pressure to produce a hardened polymerized pmma structure though other methods of polymerizing pmma for prosthetic fabrication exist , such as chemical and microwave resin activation , the previously described heat-activated resin polymerization technique is the most commonly used due to its cost effectiveness and minimal polymerization shrinkage ; artificial teeth : while denture teeth can be made of several different materials , pmma is a material of choice for the manufacturing of artificial teeth used in dental prosthetics mechanical properties of the material allow for heightened control of aesthetics , easy surface adjustments , decreased risk of fracture when in function in the oral cavity , and minimal wear against opposing teeth additionally , since the bases of dental prosthetics are often constructed using pmma , adherence of pmma denture teeth to pmma denture bases is unparalleled , leading to the construction of a strong and durable prosthetic acrylic paint essentially consists of pmma suspended in water ; however since pmma is hydrophobe , a substance with both hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups needs to be added to facilitate the suspension as early as 1939 , los angeles-based dutch sculptor jan de swart experimented with samples of lucite sent to him by dupont ; de swart created tools to work the lucite for sculpture and mixed chemicals to bring about certain effects of color and refraction de swart , ursula collection of jock de swart , durango , co from approximately the 1960s onward , sculptors and glass artists such as jan kubíček , leroy lamis , and frederick hart began using acrylics , especially taking advantage of the material 's flexibility , light weight , cost and its capacity to refract and filter light the type of acrylic used in tanning beds is most often formulated from a special type of polymethyl methacrylate , a compound that allows the passage of ultraviolet rays sheets of pmma are commonly used in the sign industry to make flat cut out letters in thicknesses typically varying from acrylic is also used extensively throughout the sign industry as a component of wall signs where it may be a backplate , painted on the surface or the backside , a faceplate with additional raised lettering or even photographic images printed directly to it , or a spacer to separate sign components plastic optical fiber used for short distance communication is made from pmma , and perfluorinated pmma , clad with fluorinated pmma , in situations where its flexibility and cheaper installation costs outweigh its poor heat tolerance and higher attenuation over glass fiber exposure to these creates chain scission or ( de-cross-linking ) within the pmma , allowing for the selective removal of exposed areas by a chemical developer , making it a positive photoresist
