stuart and revett 's findings , published in 1762 ( first volume ) as the antiquities of athens , british museum entry for the antiquities of athens along with julien-david le roy 's ( 1758 ) were the first accurate surveys of ancient greek architecture a number of british architects in the second half of the century took up the expressive challenge of the doric from their aristocratic patrons , including benjamin henry latrobe ( notably at hammerwood park and ashdown house ) and sir john soane , but it was to remain the private enthusiasm of connoisseurs up to the first decade of the 19th century an early example of greek doric architecture ( in the facade ) , married with a more palladian interior , is the revett-designed rural church of ayot st lawrence in hertfordshire , commissioned in 1775 by lord lionel lyde of the eponymous manor the doric columns of this church , with their '' pie-crust crimped '' details , are taken from drawings that revett made of the temple of apollo on the cycladic island of delos , in the collection of books that he ( and stuart in some cases ) produced , largely funded by special subscription by the society of dilettanti seen in its wider social context , greek revival architecture sounded a new note of sobriety and restraint in public buildings in britain around 1800 as an assertion of nationalism attendant on the act of union , the napoleonic wars , and the clamour for political reform it was to be william wilkins 's winning design for the public competition for downing college , cambridge that announced the greek style was to be a dominant idiom in architecture , especially for public buildings of this sort wilkins and robert smirke went on to build some of the most important buildings of the era , including the theatre royal , covent garden ( 1808–1809 ) , the general post office ( 1824–1829 ) and the british museum ( 1823–1848 ) , the wilkins building of university college london ( 1826–1830 ) and the national gallery ( 1832–1838 ) in scotland the style was avidly adopted by william henry playfair , thomas hamilton and charles robert cockerell , who severally and jointly contributed to the massive expansion of edinburgh 's new town , including the calton hill development and the moray estate within regency architecture the style already competed with gothic revival and the continuation of the less stringent palladian and neoclassical styles of georgian architecture , the other two remaining more common for houses , both in towns and english country houses if it is tempting to see the greek revival as the expression of regency authoritarianism , then the changing conditions of life in britain made doric the loser of the battle of the styles , dramatically symbolized by the selection of charles barry 's gothic design for the palace of westminster in 1836 in both locales , doric was the court style rather than a popular movement and was heavily patronised by frederick william ii of prussia and ludwig i of bavaria as the expression of their desires for their respective seats to become the capital of germany the purity and seriousness of the style was intended as an assertion of german nationalism and partly intended as a deliberate riposte to france , where it never really caught on examples of greek revival architecture in greece include the old royal palace ( now the home of the parliament of greece ) , the academy and university of athens , the zappeion , and the national library of greece the style was generally popular in northern europe , and not in the south ( except for greece itself ) , at least during the main period at the cultural edges of europe , in the swedish region of western finland , greek revival motifs might be grafted on a purely baroque design , as in the design for oravais church by jacob rijf , 1792 this made greek architecture suddenly more attractive in both the north and south , for differing ideological purposes : for the north , greek architecture symbolized the freedom of the greeks ; in the south it symbolized the cultural glories enabled by a slave society innovations such as the greek-inspired '' sofa '' and the '' klismos chair '' allowed both american women and men to pose as greeks in their homes , and also in the numerous portraits of the period that show them lounging in greek-inspired furniture 102–41 the second phase in american greek revival saw the pupils of latrobe create a monumental national style under the patronage of banker and hellenophile nicholas biddle , including such works as the second bank of the united states by william strickland ( 1824 ) , biddle 's home '' andalusia '' by thomas u this style was very popular in the south of the us , where the palladian colonnade was already popular in façades , and many mansions and houses were built for the merchants and rich plantation owners ; millford plantation is regarded as one of the finest greek revival residential examples in the country at the same time , the popular appetite for the greek was sustained by architectural pattern books , the most important of which was asher benjamin 's the practical house carpenter ( 1830 ) while this may or may not have been the case with older wooden or plain stone temples , it was definitely not the case with the more luxurious marble temples , where colour was used sparingly to accentuate architectural highlights similarly , henri labrouste proposed a reconstruction of the temples at paestum to the académie des beaux-arts in 1829 , decked out in startling colour , inverting the accepted chronology of the three doric temples , thereby implying that the development of the greek orders did not increase in formal complexity over time , i.e asher benjamin , the american builder 's companion , 1806 asher benjamin , the builder 's guide , 1839 asher benjamin , the practical house carpenter , 1830 owen biddle , the young carpenter 's assistant , 1805 william brown , the carpenter 's assistant , 1848 minard lafever , the young builder 's general instructor , 1829 minard lafever , the beauties of modern architecture , 1833 thomas u
