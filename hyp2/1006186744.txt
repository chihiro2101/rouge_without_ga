horta at faial island ( seat of the legislative assembly ) ; and angra do heroísmo at terceira island ( seat of the judiciary and the historical capital of the azores , in addition to being the seat of the roman catholic diocese of angra ) in case of emergency , the seat of the constitutional powers can be transferred to another town , in order for the houses of parliament to sit in the same location as the president and cabinet the federal constitutional court has its seat in karlsruhe which , as a consequence , is sometimes called germany 's '' judicial capital '' ; none of germany 's highest judicial organs are located in berlin montenegro : the official capital podgorica is home to the parliament and the executive , but the seat of the presidency is in the former royal capital of cetinje 940 , issued on 24 june 1976 , designates the whole of metro manila ( ncr ) or the metropolitan area of manila as the seat of government , with the manila as the capital although lisbon is home to the parliament , the president 's and the prime minister 's official residences , all the government 's departments and the highest courts , no portuguese official document states that lisbon is the national capital sri lanka : sri jayawardenepura kotte is designated the administrative capital and the location of the parliament , while the former capital , colombo , is now designated as the '' commercial capital '' there are several countries where , for various reasons , the official capital and de facto seat of government are separated : benin : porto-novo is the official capital , but cotonou is the seat of government netherlands : amsterdam is the constitutional national capital even though the dutch government , the parliament , the supreme court , the council of state , and the work palace of the king are all located in the hague , as are all the embassies ) some historical examples of similar arrangements , where the recognized capital was not the official seat of government : kingdom of england : the traditional capital was the city of london , while westminster , outside of the boundaries of the city of london , was the seat of government many countries , with the notable exception of the united states , which recognizes jerusalem as the capital of israel , take status of jerusalem is unsettled pending future negotiations with the rise of the modern nation state , the capital city has become a symbol for the state and its government , and imbued with political meaning for example : the ruined and almost uninhabited athens was made capital of newly independent greece in 1834 , four years after the country gained its independence , with the romantic notion of reviving the glory of ancient greece a symbolic relocation of a capital city to a geographically or demographically peripheral location may be for either economic or strategic reasons ( sometimes known as a forward capital or spearhead capital ) the selection or founding of a '' neutral '' capital city , one unencumbered by regional or political identities , was meant to represent the unity of a new state when ankara , bern , canberra , madrid , ottawa and washington became capital cities sometimes , the location of a new capital city was chosen to terminate squabbling or possible squabbling between various entities , such as in the cases of canberra , ottawa , washington , wellington and managua wellington , on the southwestern tip of the north island of new zealand , replaced the much more northerly city of auckland to place the national capital close to the south island and hence to placate its residents , many of whom had sympathies with separatism the capital city is usually but not always a primary target in a war , as capturing it usually guarantees capture of much of the enemy government , victory for the attacking forces , or at the very least demoralization for the defeated forces national capitals were arguably less important as military objectives in other parts of the world , including the west , because of socioeconomic trends toward localized authority , a strategic modus operandi especially popular after the development of feudalism and reaffirmed by the development of democratic and capitalistic philosophies in 1204 , after the latin crusaders captured the byzantine capital , constantinople , byzantine forces were able to regroup in several provinces ; provincial noblemen managed to reconquer the capital after 60 years and preserve the empire for another 200 years after that
