) some historical examples of similar arrangements , where the recognized capital was not the official seat of government : kingdom of england : the traditional capital was the city of london , while westminster , outside of the boundaries of the city of london , was the seat of government unlike in federations , there is usually not a separate national capital , but rather the capital city of one constituent nation will also be the capital of the state overall , such as london , which is the capital of england and of the united kingdom similarly , each of the autonomous communities of spain and regions of italy has a capital city , such as seville and naples , while madrid is the capital of the community of madrid and of the kingdom of spain as a whole and rome is the capital of italy and of the region of lazio in the germany , each of its constituent states ( or länder , plural of land ) has its own capital city , such as dresden , wiesbaden , mainz , düsseldorf , stuttgart , and munich , as do all of the republics of the russian federation azores ( portugal ) : since the establishment of local autonomy in 1976 , the azores has three designated regional capital cities : ponta delgada at são miguel island ( seat of the autonomous government ) ; horta at faial island ( seat of the legislative assembly ) ; and angra do heroísmo at terceira island ( seat of the judiciary and the historical capital of the azores , in addition to being the seat of the roman catholic diocese of angra ) netherlands : amsterdam is the constitutional national capital even though the dutch government , the parliament , the supreme court , the council of state , and the work palace of the king are all located in the hague , as are all the embassies it lies at the southern tip of the north island of new zealand , the smaller of new zealand 's two main islands ( which subsequently became the more populous island ) '' the south island was the more densely populated from 1860 until 1900 , largely because of the discovery of gold in the sixties , the relatively easy availability of land , and the south island 's freedom from maori troubles the capital city is usually but not always a primary target in a war , as capturing it usually guarantees capture of much of the enemy government , victory for the attacking forces , or at the very least demoralization for the defeated forces the selection or founding of a '' neutral '' capital city , one unencumbered by regional or political identities , was meant to represent the unity of a new state when ankara , bern , canberra , madrid , ottawa and washington became capital cities there are several countries where , for various reasons , the official capital and de facto seat of government are separated : benin : porto-novo is the official capital , but cotonou is the seat of government vienna , the national capital of austria , is also one of the states , while bern is the ( de facto ) capital of both switzerland and of the canton of bern sri lanka : sri jayawardenepura kotte is designated the administrative capital and the location of the parliament , while the former capital , colombo , is now designated as the '' commercial capital '' in case of emergency , the seat of the constitutional powers can be transferred to another town , in order for the houses of parliament to sit in the same location as the president and cabinet sometimes , the location of a new capital city was chosen to terminate squabbling or possible squabbling between various entities , such as in the cases of canberra , ottawa , washington , wellington and managua managua , nicaragua , chosen to appease rivals in león and granada , which also were associated with the liberal and conservative political factions respectively jefferson city , missouri was selected as the state capital in 1821 , the year after missouri was admitted to the union , due to its central location within the state there have been various reasons for this , including overcrowding in that major metropolitan area , and the desire to place the capital city in a location with a better climate ( usually a less tropical one ) although lisbon is home to the parliament , the president 's and the prime minister 's official residences , all the government 's departments and the highest courts , no portuguese official document states that lisbon is the national capital , us ( 1800 ) these cities satisfy one or both of the following criteria : a deliberately planned city that was built expressly to house the seat of government , superseding a capital city that was in an established population center in australia , the term '' capital cities '' is regularly used to refer to those six state capitals plus the federal capital canberra , and darwin , the capital of the northern territory 940 , issued on 24 june 1976 , designates the whole of metro manila ( ncr ) or the metropolitan area of manila as the seat of government , with the manila as the capital a town that was chosen as a compromise among two or more cities ( or other political divisions ) , none of which was willing to concede to the the privilege of being the capital city the federal constitutional court has its seat in karlsruhe which , as a consequence , is sometimes called germany 's '' judicial capital '' ; none of germany 's highest judicial organs are located in berlin montenegro : the official capital podgorica is home to the parliament and the executive , but the seat of the presidency is in the former royal capital of cetinje they are recognized as capitals as a matter of convention , and because all or almost all the country 's central political institutions , such as government departments , supreme court , legislature , embassies , etc national capitals were arguably less important as military objectives in other parts of the world , including the west , because of socioeconomic trends toward localized authority , a strategic modus operandi especially popular after the development of feudalism and reaffirmed by the development of democratic and capitalistic philosophies the capital city naturally attracts politically motivated people and those whose skills are needed for efficient administration of national or imperial governments , such as lawyers , political scientists , bankers , journalists , and public policy ( law ) s many countries , with the notable exception of the united states , which recognizes jerusalem as the capital of israel , take status of jerusalem is unsettled pending future negotiations in 1204 , after the latin crusaders captured the byzantine capital , constantinople , byzantine forces were able to regroup in several provinces ; provincial noblemen managed to reconquer the capital after 60 years and preserve the empire for another 200 years after that a symbolic relocation of a capital city to a geographically or demographically peripheral location may be for either economic or strategic reasons ( sometimes known as a forward capital or spearhead capital ) wellington , on the southwestern tip of the north island of new zealand , replaced the much more northerly city of auckland to place the national capital close to the south island and hence to placate its residents , many of whom had sympathies with separatism the states of such countries as mexico , brazil ( including the famous cities of rio de janeiro and são paulo , capitals of their respective states ) , and australia also each have capital cities ) examples are babylon , baghdad history , ancient athens , rome , constantinople , chang'an , cusco , madrid , paris , london , moscow , beijing , tokyo , vienna , lisbon , and berlin for example : the ruined and almost uninhabited athens was made capital of newly independent greece in 1834 , four years after the country gained its independence , with the romantic notion of reviving the glory of ancient greece with the rise of the modern nation state , the capital city has become a symbol for the state and its government , and imbued with political meaning
