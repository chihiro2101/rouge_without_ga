most theoreticians agree that a transformation can be seen as started somewhere between the 1970s , the early 1990s transformations of the socialist east and the 2000s period that formed most of today 's net principles and currently as is changing the way societies work fundamentally information technology goes beyond the internet , as the principles of internet design and usage influence other areas , and there are discussions about how big the influence of specific media or specific modes of production really is frank webster notes five major types of information that can be used to define information society : technological , economic , occupational , spatial and cultural kasiwulaya and gomo ( makerere university ) allude that information societies are those that have intensified their use of it for economic , social , cultural and political transformation in 2005 , governments reaffirmed their dedication to the foundations of the information society in the tunis commitment and outlined the basis for implementation and follow-up in the tunis agenda for the information society however it does point to a problem for workers , namely how many creative people does this society need to function ? for example , it may be that you only need a few star performers , rather than a plethora of non-celebrities , as the work of those performers can be easily distributed , forcing all secondary players to the bottom of the market considering that metaphors and technologies of information move forward in a reciprocal relationship , we can describe some societies ( especially the japanese society ) as an information society because we think of it as such according to buckland in information and society , most of the meanings fall into three categories of human knowledge : information as knowledge , information as a process , and information as a thing the growth of the amount of technologically mediated information has been quantified in different ways , including society 's technological capacity to store information , to communicate information , and to compute information it is estimated that , the world 's technological capacity to store information grew from 2.6 ( optimally compressed ) exabytes in 1986 , which is the informational equivalent to less than one 730-mb cd-rom per person in 1986 ( 539 mb per person ) , to 295 ( optimally compressed ) exabytes in 2007 '' the world ’ s technological capacity to store , communicate , and compute information '' , martin hilbert and priscila lópez ( 2011 ) , science , 332 ( 6025 ) , 60-65 ; free access to the article through here : martinhilbert.net/worldinfocapacity.html this is the informational equivalent of 60 cd-rom per person in 2007 '' video animation on the world ’ s technological capacity to store , communicate , and compute information from 1986 to 2010 and represents a sustained annual growth rate of some 25 % the world 's combined effective capacity to exchange information through two-way telecommunication networks was 281 petabytes of ( optimally compressed ) information in 1986 , 471 petabytes in 1993 , 2.2 ( optimally compressed ) exabytes in 2000 , and 65 ( optimally compressed ) exabytes in 2007 , which is the informational equivalent of 6 newspapers per person per day in 2007 beniger describes the necessity of information in modern society in the following way : “ the need for sharply increased control that resulted from the industrialization of material processes through application of inanimate sources of energy probably accounts for the rapid development of automatic feedback technology in the early industrial period ( 1740-1830 ) ” ( p ideas of a knowledge or information economy , post-industrial society , postmodern society , network society , the information revolution , informational capitalism , network capitalism , and the like , have been debated over the last several decades london : heinemann marc porat distinguishes a primary ( information goods and services that are directly used in the production , distribution or processing of information ) and a secondary sector ( information services produced for internal consumption by government and non-information firms ) of the information economy based on such indicators , the information society has been defined as a society where more than half of the gnp is produced and more than half of the employees are active in the information economy that is why we can call it the programmed society , because this phrase captures its capacity to create models of management , production , organization , distribution , and consumption , so that such a society appears , at all its functional levels , as the product of an action exercised by the society itself , and not as the outcome of natural laws or cultural specificities '' ( touraine 1988 : 104 ) in the programmed society also the area of cultural reproduction including aspects such as information , consumption , health , research , education would be industrialized similarly to bell , peter otto and philipp sonntag ( 1985 ) say that an information society is a society where the majority of employees work in information jobs , i.e '' contemporary society may be described as a knowledge society based on the extensive penetration of all its spheres of life and institutions by scientific and technological knowledge '' ( stehr 2002b : 18 ) : 67 ) , there would be a large number of professions that involve working with knowledge , and a declining number of jobs that demand low cognitive skills as well as in manufacturing ( stehr 2002a ) also alvin toffler argues that knowledge is the central resource in the economy of the information society : '' in a third wave economy , the central resource – a single word broadly encompassing data , information , images , symbols , culture , ideology , and values – is actionable knowledge '' ( dyson/gilder/keyworth/toffler 1994 ) for manuel castells , network logic is besides information , pervasiveness , flexibility , and convergence a central feature of the information technology paradigm ( 2000a : 69ff ) '' one of the key features of informational society is the networking logic of its basic structure , which explains the use of the concept of 'network society ' '' ( castells 2000 : 21 ) networks constitute the new social morphology of our societies , and the diffusion of networking logic substantially modifies the operation and outcomes in processes of production , experience , power , and culture '' ( castells 2000 : 500 ) jan van dijk ( 2006 ) defines the network society as a '' social formation with an infrastructure of social and media networks enabling its prime mode of organization at all levels ( individual , group/organizational and societal ) for van dijk networks have become the nervous system of society , whereas castells links the concept of the network society to capitalist transformation , van dijk sees it as the logical result of the increasing widening and thickening of networks in nature and society darin barney uses the term for characterizing societies that exhibit two fundamental characteristics : '' the first is the presence in those societies of sophisticated – almost exclusively digital – technologies of networked communication and information management/distribution , technologies which form the basic infrastructure mediating an increasing array of social , political and economic practices ( … ) the second , arguably more intriguing , characteristic of network societies is the reproduction and institutionalization throughout ( and between ) those societies of networks as the basic form of human organization and relationship across a wide range of social , political and economic configurations and associations '' the major critique of concepts such as information society , postmodern society , knowledge society , network society , postindustrial society , etc for describing contemporary society based on a new dialectic of continuity and discontinuity , other critical scholars have suggested several terms like : transnational network capitalism , transnational informational capitalism ( christian fuchs 2008 , 2007 ) : '' computer networks are the technological foundation that has allowed the emergence of global network capitalism , that is , regimes of accumulation , regulation , and discipline that are helping to increasingly base the accumulation of economic , political , and cultural capital on transnational network organizations that make use of cyberspace and other new technologies for global coordination and communication the need to find new strategies for executing corporate and political domination has resulted in a restructuration of capitalism that is characterized by the emergence of transnational , networked spaces in the economic , political , and cultural system and has been mediated by cyberspace as a tool of global coordination and communication economic , political , and cultural space have been restructured ; they have become more fluid and dynamic , have enlarged their borders to a transnational scale , and handle the inclusion and exclusion of nodes in flexible ways but global network capitalism is based on structural inequalities ; it is made up of segmented spaces in which central hubs ( transnational corporations , certain political actors , regions , countries , western lifestyles , and worldviews ) centralize the production , control , and flows of economic , political , and cultural capital ( property , power , definition capacities ) '' networks are directly generalizing the social and cultural range of the capitalist economy as never before '' ( schiller 2000 : xiv ) virtual capitalism : the '' combination of marketing and the new information technology will enable certain firms to obtain higher profit margins and larger market shares , and will thereby promote greater concentration and centralization of capital '' ( dawson/john bellamy foster 1998 : 63sq ) , high-tech capitalism wolfgang fritz haug ( 2003 ) high-tech-kapitalismus manuel castells sees informationalism as a new technological paradigm ( he speaks of a mode of development ) characterized by '' information generation , processing , and transmission '' that have become '' the fundamental sources of productivity and power '' ( castells 2000 : 21 ) the '' most decisive historical factor accelerating , channelling and shaping the information technology paradigm , and inducing its associated social forms , was/is the process of capitalist restructuring undertaken since the 1980s , so that the new techno-economic system can be adequately characterized as informational capitalism '' ( castells 2000 : 18 ) castells has added to theories of the information society the idea that in contemporary society dominant functions and processes are increasingly organized around networks that constitute the new social morphology of society ( castells 2000 : 500 ) is critical of castells and argues that the latter 's account is technologically determinist because castells points out that his approach is based on a dialectic of technology and society in which technology embodies society and society uses technology ( castells 2000 : 5sqq ) overall , neo-marxist accounts of the information society have in common that they stress that knowledge , information technologies , and computer networks have played a role in the restructuration and globalization of capitalism and the emergence of a flexible regime of accumulation ( david harvey 1989 ) they warn that new technologies are embedded into societal antagonisms that cause structural unemployment , rising poverty , social exclusion , the deregulation of the welfare state and of labour rights , the lowering of wages , welfare , etc concepts such as knowledge society , information society , network society , informational capitalism , postindustrial society , transnational network capitalism , postmodern society , etc show that there is a vivid discussion in contemporary sociology on the character of contemporary society and the role that technologies , information , communication , and co-operation play in it information society theory discusses the role of information and information technology in society , the question which key concepts shall be used for characterizing contemporary society , and how to define such concepts from sharing information via different time zones ( such as talking online ) to information ending up in a different location ( sending a letter overseas ) this has all become a habitual process that we as a society take for granted therefore , through the use of second nature and third nature society is able to use and explore new vectors of possibility where information can be moulded to create new forms of interaction as steam power was the technology standing behind industrial society , so information technology is seen as the catalyst for the changes in work organisation , societal structure and politics occurring in the late 20th century the information age is somewhat limiting , in that it refers to a 30-year period between the widespread use of computers and the knowledge economy , rather than an emerging economic order essentially , business and capital , whose place becomes that of producing and selling information and knowledge , seems to require control over this new resource so that it can effectively be managed and sold as the basis of the information economy technically because copy protection is often easily circumvented and socially rejected because the users and citizens of the information society can prove to be unwilling to accept such absolute commodification of the facts and information that compose their environment responses to this concern range from the digital millennium copyright act in the united states ( and similar legislation elsewhere ) which make copy protection ( see drm ) circumvention illegal , to the free software , open source and copyleft movements , which seek to encourage and disseminate the '' freedom '' of various information products ( traditionally both as in '' gratis '' or free of cost , and liberty , as in freedom to use , explore and share ) caveat : information society is often used by politicians meaning something like '' we all do internet now '' ; the sociological term information society ( or informational society ) has some deeper implications about change of societal structure because we lack political control of intellectual property , we are lacking in a concrete map of issues , an analysis of costs and benefits , and functioning political groups that are unified by common interests representing different opinions of this diverse situation that are prominent in the information society aleksander aristovnik ( 2014 ) development of the
