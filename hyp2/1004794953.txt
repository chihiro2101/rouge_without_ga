he came to the kingdom of jerusalem before 1153 when he was mentioned as a mercenary fighting in the army of baldwin iii of jerusalem baldwiniii of jerusalem ( who was the cousin of raymond 's widow , constance , the ruling princess of antioch ) came to antioch at the head of his army at least three times during the following years emperor manuel sent his envoys to antioch , proposing to recognize raynald as the new prince if he launched a campaign against the armenians of cilicia , who had risen up against byzantine rule they only left cyprus on the rumour of an imperial fleet approaching the island , but only after they had forced all cypriots to ransom themselves , with the exception of the wealthiest individuals ( including emperor manuel 's nephew , john doukas komnenos ) , whom they carried off to antioch taking advantage of the presence of thierry , count of flanders , and his army in the holy land and an earthquake that destroyed most towns of northern syria , baldwiniii of jerusalem invaded the muslim territories in the valley of the orontes river in the autumn of 1157 before the capitulation of the garrison , baldwin decided to grant the fortress to thierry of flanders , but raynald demanded that the count should pay homage to him for the town william of tyre stated that '' the glory of the latin world was put to shame '' on this occasion , because envoys from the nearby muslim and christian rulers were also present at raynald 's humiliation raynald also had to promise that he would allow a byzantine garrison to stay in the citadel whenever it was required and would send a troop to fight in the byzantine army before long , baldwiniii of jerusalem persuaded manuel to consent to the return of the latin patriarch , aimery , to antioch , instead of installing a greek patriarch raynald made a plundering raid in the valley of the river euphrates at marash to seize cattle , horses and camels from the local peasants in november 1160 or 1161 in raynald 's absence , constance wanted to rule alone , but baldwiniii of jerusalem made patriarch aimery regent for her fifteen-year-old son ( raynald 's stepson ) , bohemond iii of antioch when gümüshtekin , governor of aleppo , one of the last independent muslim rulers in syria before saladin , had conquered almost all neighboring states , he released raynald , along with joscelin of courtenay and all other christians prisoners in 1176 hugo etherianis , who lived in constantinople after around 1165 , mentioned in the preface of his about the procession of the holy spirit that he had asked '' prince raynald '' to deliver a copy of the work to aimery of limoges according to historian bernard hamilton , these words suggest that raynald led the embassy that baldwiniv sent to constantinople to confirm an alliance between jerusalem and the byzantine empire against egypt raynald and baldwiniv 's brother-in-law , william of montferrat , jointly granted large estates to rodrigo álvarez , the founder of the order of mountjoy , to strengthen the defence of the southern and eastern frontier of the kingdom baldwin iv 's cousin , philip i , count of flanders , came to the holy land at the head of a crusader army in early august 1177 saladin invaded the region of ascalon , but the royal army launched an attack on him in the battle of montgisard on 25november , leading to his defeat raynald became one of the principal supporters of guy of lusignan , who married the king 's elder sister , sybilla , in early 1180 , although many barons of the realm had opposed the marriage the king 's half sister , isabella ( whose stepfather , balian of ibelin was guy of lusignan 's opponent ) was engaged to raynald 's stepson , humphrey iv of toron , in autumn 1180 baldwiniv dispatched raynald , along with heraclius , latin patriarch of jerusalem , to mediate a reconciliation between bohemond iii of antioch and patriarch aimery in early 1181 though raynald 's naval expedition '' showed a remarkable degree of initiative '' , according to historian bernard hamilton , most modern historians agree that it contributed to the unification of syria and egypt under saladin 's rule raynald was not present at the child 's coronation , because he attended the wedding of his stepson , humphrey , and baldwiniv 's sister , isabella , in kerak after saladin broke into the town , raynald only managed to escape to the fortress because one of his retainers had hindered the attackers from seizing the bridge between the town and the castle the high court of jerusalem had ruled that neither baldwinv 's mother , sybilla ( who was guy of lusignan 's wife ) , nor her sister , isabella ( who was the wife of raynald 's stepson ) , could be crowned without the decision of the pope , the holy roman emperor , and the kings of france and england about baldwinv 's lawful successor her opponents tried to persuade raynald 's stepson , humphrey , to claim the crown on his wife 's behalf , but humphrey deserted them and swore fealty to sybilla and guy raynald headed the list of secular witnesses in four royal charters issued between 21october 1186 and 7march 1187 , showing that he had become a principal figure in the new king 's court this '' seems unlikely to be true '' , according to historian bernard hamilton , because the truce between the kingdom of jerusalem and saladin covered raynald 's domains however , raynald refused to obey the king , stating that '' he was lord of his land , just as guy was lord of his , and he had no truces with the saracens '' image : bnf , mss fr 68 , folio 399.jpg thumb right alt a bearded man wearing a turban with a sword in his hand and a beheaded body before a tent execution of raynald at hattin the estoire de eracles wrongly claimed that saladin 's sister was also among the prisoners taken by raynald when he seized the caravan raynald and gerard of ridefort convinced guy of lusignan to take the initiative and attack saladin 's army , although raymondiii of tripoli had tried to persuade the king to avoid a direct fight with it the reliability of the reports of saladin 's offer to raynald is subject to a scholarly debate , because the muslim authors who recorded them may have only wanted to improve saladin 's image according to ernoul , raynald 's head was struck off by saladin 's mamluks and it was brought to damascus to be '' dragged along the ground to show the saracens , whom the prince had wronged , that vengeance had been exacted '' baha ad-din also wrote that raynald 's fate shocked guy of lusignan , but saladin soon comforted him , stating that '' a king does not kill a king , but that man 's perfidy and insolence went too far '' raynald 's first wife , constance of antioch ( born in 1128 ) , was the only daughter of bohemond ii of antioch and alice of antioch raynald also had a son , baldwin , from constance , according to historian bernard hamilton , but runciman says that baldwin was constance 's son from her first husband raynald 's second wife , stephanie of milly , was the younger daughter of philip of milly , lord of nablus , and isabella of oultrejourdain the author of the estoire of eracles stated that raynald 's attack against a caravan at the turn of 1186 and 1187 was the '' reason of the loss of the kingdom of jerusalem '' among modern historians , bernard hamilton describes raynald as '' an experienced and responsible crusader leader '' who made several attempts to prevent saladin from uniting the muslim realms along the borders of the crusader states .
