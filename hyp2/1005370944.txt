they shall use a pedestrian crossing whenever there is one nearby ; '' ( §6.a ) '' at other pedestrian crossings , pedestrians shall not step on to the carriageway without taking the distance and speed of approaching vehicles into account pedestrian signals can also use a triangular-prism-shaped '' cutaway visor '' or '' cap visor '' ( so named because the pitch of the visor , is shaped like a baseball cap ) , which mainly covers the top of the signal and the tops of the left and right sides ; or a more rectangular-shaped '' tunnel visor '' , which fully covers the left , right , and top sides of the pedestrian display some more innovative crossing treatments include in-pavement flashers , yellow flashing warning lights installed in the roadway , or hawk beacon—an overhead signal with a pair of red beacons above an amber beacon , when a pedestrian is detected or actuates the device it begins a sequence of amber flashing followed by a solid red , followed by a flashing red phase that allows motorists to proceed , only if the pedestrian ( s ) are clear of the travel way provides a crossing in a low pedestrians flow area , if the pedestrian flow is high ( as outside a school , train or bus terminal ) the vehicle traffic will be severally affected by a significant number of pedestrians using the crossing , making necessary to provide traffic signals pedestrian crossings across railways may be arranged differently elsewhere , such as in new south wales , where they consist of : a barrier which closes when a train approaches ; a '' red man '' light ; no light when no train approaching an alarm in france , when a train is approaching , a red man is shown with the word stop flashing in red ( r25 signal ) this design permits to provide staggered green time for pedestrians ( one side can be green while the other is red ) , the pedestrian needs to wait in the central reservation for the second crossing , improving the possibility to coordinate vehicle traffic between intersection , with a reduction of stops , fuel consumption , and reduced car emissions in europe , the minimum width recommended for pedestrian crossings is 2.5 m ( or 8-foot ) on roads on which the speed limit is lower than 60 & nbsp ; km/h ( or 37 & nbsp ; mph ) , and 4 m ( or 13-foot ) on roads wit a higher or no speed limit additionally , a 2000 study of pedestrian countdown timers in lake buena vista , florida , at several intersections near walt disney world , found that pedestrians were more likely to cross the street during the pedestrian clearance interval ( flashing upraised hand ) if there is a timer present , compared to at intersections where there was no timer present in lisbon , some signals have a '' do n't walk '' indicator that dances ; these '' dancing man '' signals , created by daimler ag , were created to encourage pedestrians to wait for the '' walk '' indicator , with the result that 81 % more pedestrians stopped and waited for the '' walk '' light compared to at crosswalks with conventional signals that portion of a roadway included within the extension of the boundary lines of sidewalks at intersections where the intersecting roadways meet at approximately right angles , except the extension of such lines from an alley across a street '' ) all states except maine and michigan require vehicles to yield to a pedestrian who has entered an unmarked crosswalk in places where there is very high pedestrian traffic , embedded pavement flashing-light systems are used to signal traffic of pedestrian presence , or pedestrian scramble ( also known as barnes dances ) may be used , which stop vehicular traffic in all directions at the same time '' 3d crosswalk designs have also been installed in china , with a '' floating zebra crossing '' implemented in a village in luoyuan county to boost tourism ; a multicolored 3-d crossing installed in changsha to catch drivers ' attention ; and another multicolored crossing in sichuan that serves the same purpose as the colored changsha crosswalk during this red-plus-yellow indication , the intersection is closed to vehicular traffic and pedestrians are given an '' exclusive pedestrian interval '' , or a pedestrian scramble phase , in which they can cross any leg of the intersection , usually in whatever direction they choose a gridded '' egg-crate visor '' is customarily placed in front of the lights to shield them from the sun and increase their visibility , but such visors can also be vulnerable to snow or ice accumulation on the screens , which in turn could block the pedestrian display if the road is wide , ( two or more traffic lines per traffic direction ) and a central reservation exists or can be provided , traffic signals can be installed in a not aligned pair pedestrian refuges or small islands in the middle of a street may be added when a street is very wide , as these crossings can be too long for some individuals to cross in one cycle regardless of whether pictograms or words are used , the mutcd defines a steady '' upraised hand '' or '' do n't walk '' signal as an indication that a pedestrian can not enter the street in that signal 's direction , while a steady '' walking man '' or '' walk signal '' indicates that pedestrians can start crossing the street toward that signal however , in some states ( such as utah ) , if the driver is in a school zone with the lights flashing , the driver must wait until the entire crosswalk is clear before he may proceed louis , efficacy of rectangular-shaped rapid flash led beacons , retrieved 25 march 2011 impacts of led brightness , flash pattern , and location for illuminated pedestrian traffic control device , federal highway administration , may 2015 in areas with heavy snowfall , using in-pavement lighting can be problematic , since snow can obscure the lights , and snowplows can damage them these pedestrian refuges may consist of building new concrete traffic islands in the middle of the road ; extending an existing island or median strip to the crosswalk to provide a refuge ; or simply cutting through the existing island or median strip where the median is already continuous the countdown is not supposed to be displayed during the pedestrian '' walk '' interval ( '' steady walking person '' phase ) , some municipalities have found that there are instances where pedestrian countdown signals may be less effective than standard hand/man or '' '' / '' '' signals other crossings worldwide also feature some of roadsworth 's work , including a crosswalk in montreal where the zebra stripes are shaped like bullets , as well as '' conveyor belt '' crosswalk in winston-salem , north carolina see here ( discussing the uniform vehicle code and stating that '' a crosswalk at an intersection is defined as the extension of the sidewalk or the shoulder across the intersection , regardless of whether it is marked or not they can also be beneficial in locations where the sidewalk or pedestrian path naturally ascends or descends to a different level than the intersection itself , and the natural '' desire line '' leads to a footbridge or tunnel , respectively on multilane roads carrying over 12,000 vehicles per day , a marked crosswalk is likely to have worse safety performance than an otherwise similar unmarked location , unless safety features such as raised median refuges or pedestrian beacons are also installed in the united states , these '' mid-block crossings '' may include additional regulatory signage such as '' ped xing '' ( for '' pedestrian crossing '' ) , flashing yellow beacons , stop or yield signs , or by actuated or automatic signals at crossings controlled by signals , the most common variety is arranged like this : at each end of a crosswalk , the poles which hold the traffic lights also have white '' walk '' and portland orange '' do n't walk '' signs this normally occurs several seconds before the light turns yellow , usually going solid orange when the traffic light turns yellow or red ; however , the display can be turned into a steady hand or '' do n't walk '' sign while the vehicular light is yellow , or while the vehicular signal is still displaying a green light in some countries , including the us , '' unmarked crosswalks '' are presumed to occur at intersections even if a crossing is n't marked , except at locations where pedestrian crossing is expressly prohibited for crosswalk safety , in the usa there is not much clarity regarding the need for a crosswalk to be marked or unmarked dues to advantages and disadvantages of both approaches , although each city might have its own rules a reader of the times wrote to the editor in 1911 : '' could you do something to help the pedestrian to recover the old margin of safety on our common streets and roads ? it is heartrending to read of the fearful deaths taking place marked crosswalks are usually placed at traffic intersections or crossroads , but are occasionally used at mid-block locations where pedestrian generators are present such as at transit stops , schools , retail , or housing destinations study of 1,000 marked crosswalks and 1,000 unmarked comparison sites found that on most roads , the difference in safety performance of marked and unmarked crossings is not statistically significant , unless additional safety features are used in boston , some busy intersections are programmed to give a pedestrian cycle during certain times of day ( so pushing the button is not necessary ) but at off-peak times a button push is required to get a pedestrian cycle in some countries , instead of '' do n't walk '' , a depiction of a red man or hand indicating when not to cross , the drawing of the person crossing appears with an '' x '' drawn over it as of the 2000 mutcd , modern signals are mandated to use pictograms of an orange '' upraised hand '' and a white '' walking man '' rather than words ; the hand/man display is the mandate as of the 2009 edition the other types of crossing use coloured pictogram lights , depending on the intended users of the crossing this will be a man , a bicycle or a horse in intersections with '' leading pedestrian intervals , '' the upraised hand or '' do n't walk '' sign will continue flashing as the vehicular lights turn red and the other crossing ( s ) in the intersection display a walking man or '' walk '' sign reflector signposting is used at crossings in school zones ; however , given that most school crossings in the country are manned , these signs only serve as a warning to motorists in some areas , the signal timing technique of a leading pedestrian interval ( lpi ) allows pedestrians exclusive access to a crosswalk , typically 3–7 seconds , before vehicular traffic is permitted in those countries , the '' pedestrian crossing sign '' is on a blue or black ground , with a white or yellow triangle where the symbol is displayed in black or dark blue at signalized intersections without separate pedestrian signal heads , the traffic signals may be programmed to turn red in all directions , followed by a steady display of yellow lights simultaneously with the red indications this facility eliminates the conflict between vehicular traffic and pedestrian , but need to be supported by some form of physical restriction preventing pedestrians from crossing at level , as they perceived the additional effort to climb the overpass the province of ontario enacted a law in 2016 that mandates that drivers and bicyclists come to a complete stop at pedestrian '' crossovers '' —ladder-style crosswalks that are sometimes designated with overhead signs or lights—as well as crosswalks with crossing guard a 2000 study of these detectors in los angeles , phoenix , and rochester found that the infrared and microwave technologies both helped reduce conflicts between pedestrians and turning vehicles , as well as pedestrians starting during the '' do n't walk '' phase ; however , as of the 2003 mutcd , this was replaced by an optional '' animated eyes '' indication within the pedestrian signal display , which was placed in the mutcd following a study that recommended the usage of the '' animated eyes '' signal
