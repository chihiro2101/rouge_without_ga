the ecliptic b , which is divided into 12 signs , and each sign into 30 degrees , and also into the months and days of the year ; in such a manner , that the degree or point of the ecliptic in which the sun is , on any given day , stands over that day in the circle of months the tropic of cancer c , touching the ecliptic at the beginning of cancer in e , and the tropic of capricorn d , touching the ecliptic at the beginning of capricorn in f ; each 23½ degrees from the equinoctial circle each quarter of the former of these colures is divided into 90 degrees , from the equinoctial to the poles of the world , for showing the declination of the sun , moon , and stars ; and each quarter of the latter , from the ecliptic as e and f , to its poles b and d , for showing the latitude of the stars in the north pole of the ecliptic is a nut b , to which is fixed one end of the quadrantal wire , and to the other end a small sun y , which is carried round the ecliptic b—b , by turning the nut : and in the south pole of the ecliptic is a pin d , on which is another quadrantal wire , with a small moon ζ upon it , which may be moved round by hand : but there is a particular contrivance for causing the moon to move in an orbit which crosses the ecliptic at an angle of 5⅓ degrees , to opposite points called the moon 's nodes ; and also for shifting these points backward in the ecliptic , as the moon 's nodes shift in the heaven within these circular rings is a small terrestrial globe i , fixed on an axis k , which extends from the north and south poles of the globe at n and s , to those of the celestial sphere at n and s to this globe is fitted the movable horizon m , so as to turn upon the two strong wires proceeding from its east and west points to the globe , and entering the globe at the opposite points off its equator , which is a movable brass ring set into the globe in a groove all around its equator the horizon is divided into 360 degrees all around its outermost edge , within which are the points of the compass , for showing the amplitude of the sun and the moon , both in degrees and points the celestial meridian l passes through two notches in the north and south points of the horizon , as in a common globe : both here , if the globe be turned round , the horizon and meridian turn with it at the south pole of the sphere is a circle of 25 hours , fixed to the rings , and on the axis is an index which goes round that circle , if the globe be turned round its axis the whole fabric is supported on a pedestal n , and may be elevated or depressed upon the joint o , to any number of degrees from 0 to 90 , by means of the arc p , which is fixed in the strong brass arm q , and slides in the upright piece r , in which is a screw at r , to fix it at any proper elevation when the winch is put upon the axis v , and turn backward , the terrestrial globe , with its horizon and celestial meridian , keep at rest ; and the whole sphere of circles turns round from east , by south , to west , carrying the sun y , and moon z , round the same way , and causing them to rise above and set below the horizon but when the winch is put upon the axis u , and turned forward , the sphere with the sun and moon keep at rest ; and the earth , with its horizon and meridian , turn round from horizon to the sun and moon , to which these bodies came when the earth kept at rest , and they were carried round it ; showing that they rise and set in the same points of the horizon , and at the same times in the hour circle , whether the motion be in the earth or in the heaven to rectify the sphere for use , first slacken the screw r in the upright stem r , and taking hold of the arm q , move it up or down until the given degree of latitude for any place be at the side of the stem r ; and then the axis of the sphere will be properly elevated , so as to stand parallel to the axis of the world , if the machine be set north and south by a small compass : this done , count the latitude from the north pole , upon the celestial meridian l , down towards the north notch of the horizon , and set the horizon to that latitude ; then , turn the nut b until the sun y comes to the given day of the year in the ecliptic , and the sun will be at its proper place for that day : find the place of the moon 's ascending node , and also the place of the moon , by an ephemeris , and set them right accordingly : lastly , turn the winch w , until either the sun comes to the meridian l , or until the meridian comes to the sun ( according as you want the sphere or earth to move ) and set the hour-index to the xii , marked noon , and the whole machine will be rectified according to needham , the earliest development of the armillary sphere in china goes back to the astronomers shi shen and gan de in the 4th century bc , as they were equipped with a primitive single-ring armillary instrument ecliptical mountings of this sort were found on the armillary instruments of zhou cong and shu yijian in 1050 , as well as shen kuo 's armillary sphere of the later 11th century , but after that point they were no longer employed on chinese armillary instruments until the arrival of the european jesuits the famous clock tower that the chinese polymath su song built by 1094 during the song dynasty would employ yi xing 's escapement with waterwheel scoops filled by clepsydra drip , and powered a crowning armillary sphere , a central celestial globe , and mechanically operated manikins that would exit mechanically opened doors of the clock tower at specific times to ring bells and gongs to announce the time , or to hold plaques announcing special times of the day being the head official for the bureau of astronomy , shen kuo was an avid scholar of astronomy , and improved the designs of several astronomical instruments : the gnomon , armillary sphere , clepsydra clock , and sighting tube fixed to observe the pole star indefinitely the english name of this device comes ultimately from the latin armilla ( circle , bracelet ) , since it has a skeleton made of graduated metal circles linking the poles and representing the equator , the ecliptic , meridians and parallels islamic astronomy produced an improved version of the greek armillary sphere in the 8th century , and wrote about it in the treatise of dhat al-halaq or the instrument with the rings by the persian astronomer fazari ( d.c the spherical astrolabe , a variation of both the astrolabe and the armillary sphere , was invented during the middle ages in the middle east the altitude of the sun , or the right ascension and declination of stars could be calculated with these by inputting the location of the observer on the meridian ring of the globe the mechanism of the armillary sphere succeeded that of sejong era 's armillary sphere ( honŭi 渾儀 , 1435 ) and celestial sphere ( honsang 渾象 , 1435 ) , and the jade clepsydra ( ongnu 玉漏 , 1438 ) 's sun-carriage apparatus the structure of time going train and the mechanism of striking-release in the part of clock is influenced by the crown escapement which has been developed from 14th century , and is applied to gear system which had been improved until the middle of 17th century in western-style clockwork the armillary sphere survives as useful for teaching , and may be described as a skeleton celestial globe , the series of rings representing the great circles of the heavens , and revolving on an axis within a horizon with the earth as center such a sphere is known as ptolemaic ; with the sun as center , as copernican the earliest seamless globe was invented in kashmir by the muslim astronomer and metallurgist ali kashmiri ibn luqman in 1589–90 ( ah 998 ) during akbar the great 's reign ; another was produced in 1659–60 ( 1070 ah ) by muhammad salih tahtawi with arabic and sanskrit inscriptions ; and the last was produced in lahore by a indian astronomy and metallurgist lala balhumal lahori in 1842 during jagatjit singh bahadur 's reign the armillary sphere is commonly used in heraldry and vexillology , being mainly known as a symbol associated with portugal , the portuguese empire and the portuguese discoveries the intense use of this badge in documents , monuments , flags and other supports , during the reign of manuel i , transformed the armillary sphere from a simple personal symbol to a national one that represented the kingdom of portugal and in particular its overseas empire representing brazil , the armillary sphere became also present in the arms and the flag of the united kingdom of portugal , brazil and the algarves
