example of british black propaganda to bolster morale in the uk , usa and occupied europe author james hayward has proposed that the rumours , which were widely reported in the american press , were a successfully engineered example of black propaganda with an aim of ensuring american co-operation and securing lend lease resources by showing that the united kingdom was capable of successfully resisting the might of the german army these leaflets used the title of frihedsposten , a genuine danish underground newspaper , and claimed that the '' hour of liberation '' was approaching throughout the cold war , the soviet union effectively used the kgb 's service a of the first chief directorate in order to conduct its covert , or '' black '' , '' active measures '' it was service a that was responsible for clandestine campaigns that were targeted at foreign governments , public populations , as well as to influence individuals and specific groups that were hostile towards the soviet government and its policies by the 1980s , service a consisted of nearly 120 officers whose responsibilities consisted of covert media placements , and controlled media to covertly introduce carefully manufactured information , disinformation , and slogans into the areas such as government , media , and religion of their targeted countries , namely the united states because both the soviet union and the kgb 's involvements were not acknowledged and intentionally disguised , these operations are therefore classified as a form of black propaganda the activities of service a greatly

campaigns that used disinformation and other covert activities to 'white ' public affairs that rely on truthful news releases osi 's operations were to do more than public relations work , but included contacting and emailing media , journalists , and foreign community leaders with information that would counter foreign governments and organizations that are hostile to the united states the

nationalists , hate-type organizations and groups , their leadership , membership , and supporters the fbi 's strategy was captured in a 1968 memo : '' consider the use of cartoons , photographs , and anonymous letters which will have the effect of ridiculing the new left papers project ) ) '' the penkovsky papers '' are an example of a black propaganda effort conducted by the united states ' central intelligence agency during the 1960s the '' penkovsky papers '' were alleged to have been written by a soviet gru defector , colonel oleg penkovsky , but were in fact produced by the cia in an effort to diminish the soviet union 's credibility at a pivotal time during the cold war in fact , the book describes all of the practices scientology opposes ( neurosurgery , psychiatric drugs , psychology , child labour law , and income tax ) as communist conspiracies directed by moscow , and it describes the greatest threat to '' communism '' as being '' the church of scientology '' ( the
