dundee was fatally wounded towards the end of the battle , and died shortly afterwards ; a letter sent under his name to james reporting the victory is generally thought to be a forgery , although it provides a useful summary of the action in february 1685 , the catholic james ii & vii came to power with widespread support ; the 1638 to 1651 wars of the three kingdoms meant many in both england and scotland feared the consequences of bypassing the 'natural heir ' on the morning of 27 july , dundee learned mackay 's forces were entering the pass of killiecrankie , a track nearly long with the river garry on the left and steep hills on either side inexperience in their use and the speed of the highland charge left the government troops defenceless and many fled , abandoning balfour , who was killed along with james mackay , hugh 's younger brother alexander cannon took over as leader , and while not as talented a commander as dundee , he faced the same problems ; without siege equipment , he could not capture a port , making resupply almost impossible , while lack of cavalry made them vulnerable in the open william landed in brixham on 5 november with 14,000 men ; as he advanced , james ' army deserted , and he went into exile on 23 december the highlanders halted their pursuit to loot the baggage train , and their own casualties were enormous , with between 600 and 800 wounded or killed , the vast majority on the government left sir alexander mclean and 400 men were sent to skirmish with the advance guard , while dundee assembled the rest of his troops on the lower slopes of creag eallich , north of the pass as colonels were paid for the number of men in their regiment , there was an obvious temptation to over-report pre-battle figures , but it is possible they suffered losses of up to 50 % on 27 june , dundee wrote to the earl of melfort asking for reinforcements ; the loss of kintyre after the battle of loup hill made resupply from ireland extremely difficult and the letter details alternative landing spots in april , dundee joined him at glenroy and on 18 may , took his force of around 1,800 highlanders and attempted to bring mackay to battle
