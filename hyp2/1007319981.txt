structurally symmetrical , balanced and stable , it is composed of three separate rooms , which contain murals that narrate the events surrounding the accession to the throne by chooj , son of bonampak ruler yajaw chaan muwan , and grandson of aj sak teles although there has been some disagreement as to the temporal sequence of events , it is generally agreed that the narrative should be viewed in chronological order , beginning in room 1 ( scene of tribute , dressing , dance , mummery and musical performance ) ; then on to room 2 ( scene of violent conflict , and a display in which a human cull is presented , tortured and killed in the company of the highest members of court and upper echelons of the victorious force ) ; and , finally , to room 3 ( scene of a dance , with observers , and ritual bloodletting ) in total , there are some 281 human figures represented within the three rooms , many with captions ( approximately 1/3 of the figures are named , while another 10 percent of the figures have blank captions , and slightly more than half have no caption at all ) a few theories as to why some captions were left blank include deaths or political realignment , an interruption of the murals related to the ostensible lowland maya collapse during the period of structure 1 's creation , and the possibility that it became politically impolite to name certain figures essentially , the artists at bonampak framed the lower course of the exterior of structure 1 as if it were a maya vase ; more specifically , this was done in the codex-style vases of the petén , and not mirroring those of the usumacinta region where bonampak is located in 1996 , a team from yale university led by professor mary miller began the bonampak documentation project , which included making an even more detailed study , photographic record , and reproductions of the murals for a more detailed description about the bonampak documentation project , and a thorough discussion on the murals , see mary miller and claudia brittenham 's 2013 seminal work on the subject titled , the spectacle of the late maya court : reflections on the murals of bonampak room 1 : thumbthis is the scene of a regal event : the acknowledgement , in front of the court and visiting dignitaries , by the bonampak ruler , yajaw chaan muwan , of his son 's right to rule some of the actors that capture immediate attention are the elegantly costumed figures on the lower register of the south wall ( hf 's 62 , 63 , and 64 ) to the viewer 's left of hf 62 , beginning on the south wall and leading to the east wall , there are several figures playing instruments ( rattles , drums , and turtle shells ) and singing , which fill this room with celebratory music of particular note is hf 71 , standing in a familiar pose to smokers of today , as he , too , embraces a long , thin cigarette , expressing some combination of calm , lack of interest and boredom on the lower register of the north wall , still more musicians ( hf 's 43 and 44 ) blast their trumpets , while other performers ( hf 's 45–50 ) wear various costumes , including that of a crocodile ( hf 48 ) conspicuously placed upon a raised platform on the upper register of the south wall , just above two holes where wooden beams had once ran through to help support the structure , stands a lone figure ( hf 16 ) presenting a child ( hf 15 ) to the lords the south wall , which is the first that is viewed upon entering , along with the east and the west walls , depict warriors in the heat of battle the ancient maya believed that to be left-handed was a sign of femininity and weakness , thus the warriors who are shown as defeated—including already being stripped nude , with the victors gripping them by the hair—or those in the process of being defeated , are depicted as being left-handed ( e.g in addition to left-handedness , the losers are also all wearing some element of a bird—or , at least those that are still in their battle costumes , and have not yet been stripped of them therefore , it is of no surprise to see the main character on the upper register of the south wall , yajaw chan muwaan ( hf 55 ) , firmly gripping a jaguar skin-covered spear in his right hand while donning a large , extravagant jaguar headdress—which may contain a water-lily scroll—and wearing a jaguar jerkin and jaguar boots although it is clear that the events surrounding the ascension to the thrown of chooj depicted in structure 1 are narrating actual events , it is equally clear that bonampak 's version of the actual events is more propagandistic in nature as one turns to view the north wall , the viewer is greeted by the sequel to the battle : torture and sacrifice of the captives taken in battle nude and almost nude captives ( only wearing a loin cloth ) are depicted in deep agony , as some of them are in the process of getting their fingernails ripped off , or have already undergone this torture and bleed from their wounds ( hf 's 101–109 ) the skeleton was accompanied by jade earrings , a jade necklace and bracelets , a spondylus shell pendant , two polychrome plates , an alabaster vase with a hole in the base , and a stone knife it is clear that this tomb was part of the original construction of structure 1 and was not , therefore , created at a later date here is another instance where the bonampak documentation project was able to decipher that which is not able to be seen by the naked eye—in this instance , the paint had been completely eroded in this area however , the infrared images revealed that what hf 22 had in his left hand was none other than the still beating heart of the sacrificial victim below ( hf 19 ) , who is being dragged down the pyramid steps by two attendants ( hf 's 18 and 20 ) covering almost the entire bottom register of the south and west walls are seven more elaborately costumed characters ( hf 's 13 , 15 , 17 , 26 , 26 , 27 and 28 ) with similar headdresses to those of the brothers above them above the entire south wall scene , set among a background of yellow —the first appearance of a color not representing reality — is a supernatural entity with square eyes , and a single frontal , pointed tooth the upper register of the west wall contains a musical procession with masked performers , carrying a dwarf ( hf 42 ) who is lifted into the yellow background of the vault , demonstrating his connection to the supernatural world it is located in the central part of the great plaza , it represents the moment of the height of chan muwan ii , the importance of the character is reflected in the way it is represented and in the difficulty to elaborate the monument , that is , in a huge slab of stone of little thickness without suffering any fracture chan muwan ii is standing and carrying a ceremonial cane , the styling of the pupil gives him a greater strength to his look ; in the lower part of the stele is observed the monster of the earth from which the faces of the young god of corn emerge it is located on a low terrace right in the center of the acropolis and next to stela 3 , it shows chan muwan ii richly dressed in the company of two women , in front of him her mother lady shield skull and behind him his wife the lady green rabbit of yaxchilán who wear a huipil the scene revolves around the ritual of self-sacrifice , performed by the ruler who carries in his right hand a bag with copal from which the face of the bat god is seen and assisted by his mother , who carries the stingray spines to perform the piercing while his wife holds the basket with the strips of paper ready to receive the blood drops of the ruler , which will later be incinerated in honor of their deities
