but , even if this suggestion were correct , the link between malaria and the observed causes of death would be entirely indirect the field of social evolution , of which hamilton 's rule has central importance , is broadly defined as being the study of the evolution of social behaviours , i.e hamilton was a visiting professor at harvard university and later spent nine months with the royal society 's and the royal geographical society 's xavantina-cachimbo expedition as a visiting professor at the university of são paulo this shortcoming would not affect the popularity of his work , however , as it was popularised by richard dawkins in dawkins ' 1976 book the selfish gene later , when his work became more mathematical and genetical , he had his supervision transferred to john hajnal of the lse and cedric smith of university college london ( ucl ) in earlier chapters , fisher provided a mathematical basis for the genetics of evolution and hamilton later blamed fisher 's book for his getting only a 2:1 degree much of the discussion relates to the evolution of eusociality in insects of the order hymenoptera ( ants , bees and wasps ) based on their unusual haplodiploid sex-determination system these were left over from his father making hand grenades for the home guard during world war & nbsp ;
