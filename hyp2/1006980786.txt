these were left over from his father making hand grenades for the home guard during world war & nbsp ; ii ; he had to have a thoracotomy and fingers on his right hand had to be amputated in king 's college hospital to save his life , and he was left with scarring and needed six months to recover in earlier chapters , fisher provided a mathematical basis for the genetics of evolution and hamilton later blamed fisher 's book for his getting only a 2:1 degree hamilton enrolled in an msc course in demography at the london school of economics ( lse ) , under norman carrier , who helped secure various grants for his studies later , when his work became more mathematical and genetical , he had his supervision transferred to john hajnal of the lse and cedric smith of university college london ( ucl ) algebraically , the rule posits that a costly action should be performed if : c where c is the cost in fitness to the actor , r the genetic relatedness between the actor and the recipient , and b is the fitness benefit to the recipient having his work passed over later led to friction between hamilton and maynard smith , as hamilton thought smith had held his work back to claim credit for the idea ( during the review period maynard smith published a paper that referred briefly to similar ideas ) the hamilton paper was printed in the journal of theoretical biology and , when first published , was largely ignored much of the discussion relates to the evolution of eusociality in insects of the order hymenoptera ( ants , bees and wasps ) based on their unusual haplodiploid sex-determination system in his 1970 paper selfish and spiteful behaviour in an evolutionary model hamilton considers the question of whether harm inflicted upon an organism must inevitably be a byproduct of adaptations for survival it can be explained as the increase in the chance of an organism 's genetic alleles to be passed to the next generations by harming those that are less closely related than relationship by chance targets of aggression are likely to act in revenge , and the majority of pairs of individuals ( assuming a panmictic species ) exhibit a roughly average level of genetic relatedness , making the selection of targets of spite problematic fisher ( 1930 ) had proposed a model as to why '' ordinary '' sex ratios were nearly always 1:1 ( but see edwards 1998 ) , and likewise extraordinary sex ratios , particularly in wasps , needed explanations this shortcoming would not affect the popularity of his work , however , as it was popularised by richard dawkins in dawkins ' 1976 book the selfish gene hamilton was a visiting professor at harvard university and later spent nine months with the royal society 's and the royal geographical society 's xavantina-cachimbo expedition as a visiting professor at the university of são paulo there he worked with the political science robert axelrod on the prisoner 's dilemma , and was a member of the bach group with original members arthur burks , robert axelrod , michael cohen , and john holland hamilton was an early proponent of the red queen theory of the evolution of sex the red queen hypothesis at indiana university this was named for a character in lewis carroll 's through the looking-glass , who is continuously running but never actually travels any distance : : '' well , in our country , '' said alice , still panting a little , '' you 'd generally get to somewhere else—if you ran very fast for a long time , as we 've been doing in 1980 , he was elected a fellow of the royal society , and in 1984 , he was invited by richard southwood to be the royal society research professor in the department of zoology at oxford , and a fellow of new college , where he remained until his death the field of social evolution , of which hamilton 's rule has central importance , is broadly defined as being the study of the evolution of social behaviours , i.e despite this rejection , he gave supportive declarations on the hypothesis to the bbc and wrote the foreword of a 1999 book , the river , by journalist edward hooper , who investigated the hypothesis to look for indirect evidence of the opv hypothesis by assessing natural levels of simian immunodeficiency virus , in primates , in early 2000 , hamilton and two others ventured on a field trip to the then-war-torn democratic republic of the congo however , the pathologist had suggested the possibility that the ulceration and consequent haemorrhage had resulted from a pill ( which might have been taken because of malarial symptoms ) lodging in the diverticulum ; but , even if this suggestion were correct , the link between malaria and the observed causes of death would be entirely indirect a secular memorial service ( he was an agnostic ) was held at the chapel of new college , oxford on 1 july 2000 , organised by richard dawkins he , however , had written an essay on my intended burial and why in which he wrote : the second volume of his collected papers , evolution of sex , was published in 2002 , and the third and final volume , last words , in 2005 1978 foreign honorary member of american academy of arts and sciences 1980 fellow of the royal society of london 1982 newcomb cleveland prize of the american association for the advancement of science 1988 darwin medal of the royal society of london 1989 scientific medal of the linnean society 1991 frink medal of zoological society of london 1992/3 wander prize of the university of bern 1993 crafoord prize of the royal swedish academy of sciences 1993 kyoto prize of the inamori foundation 1995 fyssen prize of the fyssen foundation 1997 honorary title of academician of science in finland obituaries and reminiscences royal society citation truth and science : bill hamilton 's legacy centro itinerante de educação ambiental e científica bill hamilton ( the bill hamilton itinerant centre for environmental and scientific education ) ( in portuguese ) non-mathematical excerpts from hamilton 1964 '' if you have a simple idea , state it simply '' a 1996 interview with hamilton london review of books book review w
