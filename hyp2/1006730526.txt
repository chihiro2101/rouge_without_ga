there are several ways to construct gene expression networks , but one common approach is to compute a matrix of all pair-wise correlations of expression across conditions , time points , or individuals and convert the matrix ( after thresholding at some cut-off value ) into a graphical representation in which nodes represent genes , transcripts , or proteins and edges connecting these nodes represent the strength of association ( see name '' pmid 15114364 '' > more generally , gene regulation gives the cell control over all structure and function , and is the basis for cellular differentiation , morphogenesis and the versatility and adaptability of any organism while transcription of prokaryotic protein-coding genes creates mrna ( mrna ) that is ready for translation into protein , transcription of eukaryotic genes leaves a primary transcript of rna ( pre-rna ) , which first has to undergo a series of modifications to become a mature rna ideally , measurement of expression is done by detecting the final gene product ( for many genes , this is the protein ) ; however , it is often easier to detect one of the precursors , typically mrna and to infer gene-expression levels from these measurements regulation of transcription can be broken down into three main routes of influence ; genetic ( direct interaction of a control factor with the gene ) , modulation interaction of a control factor with the transcription machinery and epigenetic ( non-sequence changes in dna structure that influence transcription ) measuring gene expression is an important part of many life sciences , as the ability to quantify the level at which a particular gene is expressed within a cell , tissue or organism can provide a lot of valuable information these profiles indicate the level of dna expression ( and hence rna produced ) of a certain protein in a certain tissue , and are color-coded accordingly in the images located in the protein box on the right side of each wikipedia page the production of a rna copy from a dna strand is called transcription , and is performed by rna polymerases , which add one ribonucleotide at a time to a growing rna strand as per the complementarity law of the nucleotide bases in eukaryotes , transcription is performed in the nucleus by three types of rna polymerases , each of which needs a special dna sequence called the promoter and a set of dna-binding proteins—transcription factors—to initiate the process ( see regulation of transcription below ) in the case of transfer rna ( trna ) , for example , the 5′ sequence is removed by rnase p , whereas the 3′ end is removed by the trnase z enzyme and the non-templated 3′ cca tail is added by a nucleotidyl transferase although ngs is comparatively time-consuming , expensive , and resource-intensive , it can identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms , splice-variants , and novel genes , and can also be used to profile expression in organisms for which little or no sequence information is available in some cases rnas are additionally transported to a specific part of the cytoplasm , such as a synapse ; they are then towed by motor proteins that bind through linker proteins to specific sequences ( called '' zipcodes '' ) on the rna the stability of the final gene product , whether it is rna or protein , also contributes to the expression level of the gene—an unstable product results in a low expression level the nuclear membrane in eukaryotes allows further regulation of transcription factors by the duration of their presence in the nucleus , which is regulated by reversible changes in their structure and by binding of other proteins in prokaryotes , transcription is carried out by a single type of rna polymerase , which needs to bind a dna sequence called a pribnow box with the help of the sigma factor protein ( σ factor ) to start transcription numerous terms are used to describe types of genes depending on how they are regulated ; these include : a constitutive gene is a gene that is transcribed continually as opposed to a facultative gene , which is only transcribed when needed control of expression is vital to allow a cell to produce the gene products it needs when it needs them ; in turn , this gives cells the flexibility to adapt to a variable environment , external signals , damage to the cell , and other stimuli in the case of mirna , mirnas are first transcribed as primary transcripts or pri-mirna with a cap and poly-a tail and processed to short , 70-nucleotide stem-loop structures known as pre-mirna in the cell nucleus by the enzymes drosha and pasha it is important to note that by fusing a target protein to a fluorescent reporter the protein 's behavior , including its cellular localization and expression level , can be significantly changed regulation of gene expression refers to the control of the amount and timing of appearance of the functional product of a gene this term is normally used in the case where a gene or set of genes is switched on under well defined conditions , for example , the simple repressor switch expression system in lambda phage and the lac operator system in bacteria alternatively , '' tag based '' technologies like serial analysis of gene expression ( sage ) and rna-seq , which can provide a relative measure of the cellular concentration of different mrnas , can be used after cfc about 500 genes have increased transcription ( often due to demethylation of cpg sites in a promoter region ) and about 1,000 genes have decreased transcription ( often due to newly formed 5-methylcytosine at cpg sites in a promoter region ) in prokaryotes translation generally occurs at the point of transcription ( co-transcriptionally ) , often using a messenger rna that is still in the process of being created the pre-mrna is first cleaved and then a series of ~200 adenines ( a ) are added to form poly ( a ) tail , which protects the rna from degradation in addition to these biological tools , certain naturally observed configurations of dna ( genes , promoters , enhancers , repressors ) and the associated machinery itself are referred to as an expression system a housekeeping gene is a gene that is required to maintain basic cellular function and so is typically expressed in all cell types of an organism dna methylation is a widespread mechanism for epigenetic influence on gene expression and is seen in bacteria and eukaryotes and has roles in heritable transcription silencing and transcription regulation the most commonly used method is to perform a western blot against the protein of interest—this gives information on the size of the protein in addition to its identity major locations are the cytoplasm for soluble cytoplasmic proteins and the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum for proteins that are for export from the cell or insertion into a cell membrane an expression system consists of a gene , normally encoded by dna , and the molecular machinery required to transcribe the dna into mrna and translate the mrna into protein using the reagents provided the processing of premrna include 5′ capping , which is set of enzymatic reactions that add 7-methylguanosine ( m 7 g ) to the 5′ end of pre-mrna and thus protect the rna from degradation by exonucleases any step of gene expression may be modulated , from the dna-rna transcription step to post-translational modification of a protein similarly , the analysis of the location of protein expression is a powerful tool , and this can be done on an organismal or cellular scale in general gene expression is regulated through changes in the number and type of interactions between molecules that collectively influence transcription of dna and translation of rna genes have sometimes been regarded as nodes in a network , with inputs being proteins such as transcription factors , and outputs being the level of gene expression some housekeeping genes are transcribed at a relatively constant rate and these genes can be used as a reference point in experiments to measure the expression rates of other genes in eukaryotes the structure of chromatin , controlled by the histone code , regulates access to dna with significant impacts on the expression of genes in euchromatin and heterochromatin areas in eukaryotes the export pathway is well developed and the main mechanism for the export of these proteins is translocation to the endoplasmic reticulum , followed by transport via the golgi apparatus the mechanisms for regulating transcription are very varied , from blocking key binding sites on the dna for rna polymerase to acting as an activator and promoting transcription by assisting rna polymerase binding these changes influence a transcription factor 's ability to bind , directly or indirectly , to promoter dna , to recruit rna polymerase , or to favor elongation of a newly synthesized rna molecule many proteins are destined for other parts of the cell than the cytosol and a wide range of signalling sequences or signal peptide are used to direct proteins to where they are supposed to be after being exported , it is then processed to mature mirnas in the cytoplasm by interaction with the endonuclease dicer , which also initiates the formation of the rna-induced silencing complex , composed of the argonaute protein the gel-based nature of this assay makes quantification less accurate , but it has the advantage of being able to identify later modifications to the protein , for example proteolysis or ubiquitination , from changes in size the effects of mirna dysregulation of gene expression also seem to be important in neuropsychiatric disorders , such as schizophrenia , bipolar disorder , major depression , parkinson 's disease , alzheimer 's disease and autism spectrum disorders in the case of messenger rna ( mrna ) the rna is an information carrier coding for the synthesis of one or more proteins it is , however , widely used to measure the expression of a gene artificially introduced into the cell , for example via an expression vector in prokaryotes , transcription and translation happen together , whilst in eukaryotes , the nuclear membrane separates the two processes , giving time for rna processing to occur a sample ( often cellular lysate ) is separated on a polyacrylamide gel , transferred to a membrane and then probed with an antibody to the protein of interest for expression profiling , or high-throughput analysis of many genes within a sample , quantitative pcr may be performed for hundreds of genes simultaneously in the case of low-density arrays
