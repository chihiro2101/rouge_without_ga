pope clement vii had all the tiaras and papal regalia melted down in 1527 to raise the 400,000 ducats ransom demanded by the occupying army of holy roman empire charles v the tiara provided by the last was made from elements of former papal tiaras destroyed after the capture of rome , and was given to pius vii as a 'wedding gift ' to mark napoleon 's own marriage to empress josephine on the eve of his imperial coronation popes were not restricted to a particular tiara : for example , photographs on this page show pope john xxiii , on different occasions , wearing the tiara presented to him in 1959 , pope pius ix 's 1877 tiara , and pope pius xi 's 1922 tiara pope paul vi , whose bullet-shaped tiara is one of the most unusual in design , was the last pope to wear a papal tiara ( though any of his successors could , if they wished , revive the custom ) some of the more popular or historic tiaras , such as the 1871 belgian tiara , the 1877 tiara and the 1903 golden tiara , have been sent around the world as part of a display of historic vatican items pope paul vi 's '' milan tiara '' was donated to and is on display in the crypt church of the basilica of the national shrine of the immaculate conception in washington , d.c there are two rather unusual tiaras : the papier-mâché tiara made when pope pius vii was elected and crowned in exile , and the one made for pope paul vi in 1963 , which is somewhat bullet-shaped , contains few jewels and , instead of being adorned by three coronets , is marked with three parallel circles and has a double-tiered crown at its base in the 1870s , pope pius ix , then in his eighties , found the other tiaras too heavy to wear and that of his predecessor , pope gregory , too small , so he had a lightweight tiara made also the words that were used when popes were crowned were : accipe tiaram tribus coronis ornatam , et scias te esse patrem principum et regum , rectorem orbis in terra vicarium salvatoris nostri jesu christi , cui est honor et gloria in saecula saeculorum ( '' receive the tiara adorned with three crowns and know that thou art father of princes and kings , ruler of the world , vicar on earth of our saviour jesus christ , to whom is honour and glory for ever and ever '' ) another traditional interpretation was that the three crowns refer to the '' church militant on earth '' , the '' church suffering after death and before heaven '' , and the '' church triumphant in eternal reward '' yet another interpretation suggested by archbishop cordero lanza di montezemolo , who designed pope benedict xvi 's tiara-less coat of arms , was '' order , jurisdiction and magisterium '' , while a further theory links the three tiers to the '' celestial , human and terrestrial worlds , '' which the pope is supposed to symbolically link lord twining suggested that just as the holy roman emperors were crowned three times as king of germany , king of italy and roman emperor , so the popes , to stress the equality of their spiritual authority to the temporal authority of the emperor , chose to be crowned with a tiara bearing three crowns the tiara was thus worn in formal ceremonial processions , and on other occasions when the pope was carried on the sedia gestatoria , a portable throne whose use was ended by pope john paul ii immediately after his election in october 1978 the papal tiara was also worn when a pope gave his traditional christmas and easter urbi et orbi blessing ( '' to the city and the world '' ) from the balcony of st peter 's – the only religious ceremony at which the tiara was worn the most famous occasion when the triple tiara was used was the papal coronation , a six-hour ceremony , when the new pope was carried in state on the sedia gestatoria ( portable throne ) , with attendants fanning the pontiff with ostrich-feathered flabella to the location of the coronation michael levey ; the world of ottoman art , p.65 , 1975 , thames & hudson , conversely , the papal coronation ceremony , in which the pope was fanned with flabella ( long fans of ostrich feathers ) and carried on the sedia gestatoria ( portable throne ) , was based on the byzantine imperial ceremonies witnessed in medieval constantinople the crowned woman has variously been identified as pope joan ( a woman who according to a medieval and later protestant legend had disguised herself as a man and been elected pope ; some cards also show a child , and the pope joan legend pictured her as found out when she gave birth during a papal procession ) , as mary , mother of god , or even as cybele , as isis , or as venus cards with a woman wearing a papal tiara , produced during the protestant reformation , and apparent images of '' pope joan '' and her child , have been seen as a protestant attempt to ridicule the office of the papacy and the catholic faith robert o'neill , iconography of the early papess cards all tarot cards also contain a representation of the pope , known as the hierophant , in some cases crowned with a papal tiara
