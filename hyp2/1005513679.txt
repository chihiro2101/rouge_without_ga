between 1975 and 1981 , the belizean and british governments , frustrated at dealing with the military-dominated regimes in guatemala , began to state their case for self-determination at international forums such as a meeting of the heads of commonwealth of nations governments in jamaica , the conference of ministers of the nonaligned movement in peru , and at meetings of the united nations ( un ) by the end of the 19th century , the ethnic pattern that remained largely intact throughout the 20th century was in place : protestants largely of african descent , who spoke either english or creole , lived in belize town ; the roman catholic maya and mestizos spoke spanish and lived chiefly in the north and west ; and the roman catholic garifuna who spoke english , spanish , or garifuna and settled on the southern coast however , the remoteness of the area of british honduras in which they settled , combined with their largely subsistence way of life , resulted in the mopán and kekchí maya maintaining more of their traditional way of life and becoming less assimilated into the colony than the maya of the north the devaluation enraged labour because it protected the interests of the big transnationals , such as the belize estate and produce company , whose trade in british pounds would have suffered without devaluation while it subjected british honduras 's working class , already experiencing widespread unemployment and poverty , to higher prices for goods—especially food—imported from the united states on 28 april 1950 , the middle-class members of the people 's committee ( formerly members of the csag ) took over the leadership of the union and gave betson the dubious honorific title of '' patriarch of the union '' the pup concentrated on agitating for constitutional reforms , including universal adult suffrage without a literacy test , an all- elected legislative council , an executive council chosen by the leader of the majority party in the legislature , the introduction of a ministerial system , and the abolition of the governor 's reserve powers by 1961 , the united kingdom was willing to let the colony become independent and from 1964 controlled only defence , foreign affairs , internal security , and the terms and conditions of the public service the colonial report for 1931 stated that '' contracts for the purchase of mahogany and chicle , which form the mainstay of the colony , practically ceased altogether , thereby throwing a large number of the woodcutters and chicle-gatherers out of work '' one member of this group , george cadle price , topped the polls in the 1947 election when he opposed immigration schemes and import controls and rode a wave of feeling against a british proposal for a federation of its colonies in the caribbean a last attempt was made to reach an agreement with guatemala prior to the independence of belize and a proposal , called the heads of agreement , was initialled on 11 march 1981 as the logging of mahogany was far more labour-intensive , this also led to a significant increase of the importation of african slaves to the colony , mainly from britain 's caribbean colonies largely as a result of the costly military expeditions against the maya , the expenses of administering the new colony of british honduras increased , and that at a time of severe depression in the economy upon its designation as a crown colony in 1871 , a lieutenant governor under the governor of jamaica replaced the superintendent , and a nominated legislative council replaced the legislative assembly in spite of repeated denials by the governor that the british honduras dollar would be devalued to maintain the old exchange rate with the british pound , devaluation was nevertheless effected by the governor , using his reserve powers in defiance of the legislative council the manager of the belize estate and produce company , for example , was automatically a member of the council , while members of the emerging creole elite were excluded from holding seats on the council the third group consisted of people such as the christian social action group ( csag ) who engaged in electoral politics within the narrow limits defined by the constitution and whose goals included a '' natives first '' campaign and an extension of the franchise to elect a more representative government the general workers ' union ( gwu ) , registered in 1943 , quickly expanded into a nationwide organisation and provided crucial support for the nationalist movement that took off with the formation of the people 's united party ( pup ) in 1950 the british government seized the opportunity to impose tighter control on the colony and endowed the governor with reserve powers , or the power to enact laws in emergency situations without the consent of the legislative council the governor and the national party failed in their attempts to discredit the pup on the issue of its contacts with guatemala , which was then ruled by the democratic , reformist government of president jacobo arbenz finally , in november 1980 , with guatemala completely isolated , the un passed a resolution that demanded the independence of belize , with all its territory intact , before the next session of the un in 1981 britain argued that because neither the short-lived central american federation ( 1821–1839 ) nor guatemala had ever exercised any authority in the area or even protested the british presence in the 19th century , british honduras was clearly under british sovereignty employers among the unofficial members at the legislative council defeated a bill to repeal these penal clauses in august 1941 , but the employers and workers bill passed on 27 april 1943 , finally removed breach-of-labour-contract from the criminal code and enabled british honduras 's infant trade unions to pursue the struggle for improving labour conditions during the caste war in yucatán , a devastating struggle that halved the population of the area between 1847 and 1855 , thousands of refugees fled to the british settlement in 1927 , creole merchants and professionals replaced the representatives of british landowners , ( except for the manager of the belize estate and produce company ) on the legislative council in different ways and to different degrees , then , the maya who returned to british honduras in the 19th century became incorporated into the colony as poor and dispossessed ethnic minorities from 1749 until 1884 , british honduras was governed as a dependency of the british colony of jamaica under the new constitution of 1871 , the lieutenant governor and the legislative council , consisting of five ex-officio or '' official '' and four appointed or '' unofficial '' members , governed british honduras before the end of january 1950 , the gwu and the people 's committee were holding joint public meetings and discussing issues such as devaluation , labour legislation , the proposed west indies federation , and constitutional reform mahogany and logwood continued to account for over 80 percent of the total value of exports , but the price of these goods was so low that the economy was in a state of prolonged depression after the 1850s as a result , in 1965 the united states president lyndon johnson agreed to mediate and proposed a draft treaty that gave guatemala control over the newly independent country in areas including internal security , defence and external affairs also in 1840 , the colony formally became known as british honduras , although it was also referred to as '' the belize '' for the next few weeks , soberanis and his colleagues in the lua attacked the governor and his officials , the rich merchants , and the belize estate and produce company at biweekly meetings attended by 600 to 800 people by the time of the colony 's 1790 census , three-quarters of the population of british honduras were a mixed-race people known as '' creole people '' a set of regulations called '' burnaby 's code '' was adopted in 1765 , which continued in force until 1840 , when an executive council was created with the prospect of independence celebrations in the offing , the opposition 's morale fell and independence came to belize on 21 september 1981 , without an agreement with guatemala in 1875 , the british honduras company became the belize estate and produce company , a london-based business that owned about half of all the privately held land in the colony sir samuel hoare , a shareholder and former director , had been a british cabinet member and a friend of leo amery , the british secretary of state for the colonies the territorial dispute 's origins lay in the 18th-century treaties in which great britain acceded to spain 's assertion of sovereignty while british settlers continued to occupy the sparsely settled and ill-defined area british honduras faced two obstacles to independence : british reluctance until the early 1960s to allow citizens to govern themselves , and guatemala 's complete intransigence over its long-standing claim to the entire territory the stalemate in the protracted negotiations between the uk and guatemala over the future status of belize led belizeans after 1975 to seek the international community 's assistance in resolving issues associated with independence the creoles requested in 1890 that some seats on the council be opened to election ( as had occurred in canada and new zealand ) in the hope of winning seats , but the legislative council refused when voters went to the polls on 28 april 1954 , in the first election under universal literate adult suffrage , the main issue was clearly colonialism—a vote for the pup was a vote in favour of self-government riots , strikes and rebellions had occurred before , during and after the period of slavery , but the events of the 1930s were modern labour disturbances in the sense that they gave rise to organisations with articulate industrial and political goals in the second half of the 19th century , however , a combination of events outside and inside the colony redefined the position of the maya the firm originated in a partnership between one of the old settler families and a london merchant and was registered in 1859 as a limited company the event that precipitated price 's political career and the formation of the pup , was the devaluation of the british honduras dollar on 31 december 1949 however , the guatemalan government refused to ratify the agreement and withdrew from the negotiations , and the opposition in belize engaged in violent demonstrations against it library of congress country study '' a history of belize '' at naturalight productions ' belize

1867 , more than 300 british troops marched into the yalbac hills and destroyed the mayan villages , provision stores , and granaries in an attempt to drive them out of the district unable to agree among themselves , the members of the legislative assembly surrendered their political privileges and asked for the establishment of direct british rule in return for the greater security of crown colony status when the colony was finally severed from the administration of jamaica in 1884 , it gained its own governor nevertheless , most of the refugees were small farmers , who by 1857 were growing considerable quantities of sugar , rice , corn , and vegetables in the northern district ( now corozal and orange walk districts )
