in 1966 , the soviet luna 9 became the first spacecraft to achieve a lunar soft landing and to transmit photographic data to earth as a result , these robotic missions required soft landers to sample the lunar soil and determine the thickness of the dust layer , which was unknown before surveyor the u.s.-crewed apollo lunar modules ( 1969–1972 ) with rovers ( 1971–1972 ) and late soviet large robotic landers ( 1969– ) , lunokhods ( 1970–1973 ) and sample return missions ( 1970–1976 ) used a rocket descent engine for a soft landing of astronauts and lunar rovers on the moon the altair spacecraft , previously known as the '' lunar surface access module '' or '' lsam '' , was the planned lander for the constellation program prior to the cancellation of project constellation lander vikram on chandrayaan-2 , a maiden soft landing effort by the indian space research organization , lost contact to control on 6 september 2019 , some minutes before landing in 1971 , the lander of the mars 3 probe conducted the first soft landing on mars , but communication was lost within a minute after touchdown , which occurred during one of the worst global dust storms since the beginning of telescopic observations of the red planet while several flybys conducted by mars orbiting probes have provided images and other data about the martian moons phobos and deimos , only few of them intended to land on the surface of these satellites the huygens probe , carried to saturn 's moon titan by cassini , was specifically designed to survive landing on land or on liquid titan mare explorer ( time ) mission considered a lander that would splash down in a lake in titan 's northern hemisphere and float on the surface of the lake for few months it included a flyby of mars , where vesta would deliver an aerostat ( balloon or airship ) and small landers or penetrators , followed by flybys of ceres or 4 vesta and some other asteroids with the impact of a large penetrator on one of them the first landing on a small solar system body ( an object in the solar system that is not a moon , planet , or dwarf planet ) was performed in 2001 by the probe near shoemaker at asteroid 433 eros despite the fact that near was not originally designed to be capable of landing designed to rendezvous and land on a low-gravity body , hayabusa became the second spacecraft to land on an asteroid , and in 2010 the first sample return mission from an asteroid due to the extremely low gravity of such bodies , the landing system included a harpoon launcher intended to anchor a cable in the comet 's surface and pull the lander down japan ( jaxa ) launched the hayabusa2 asteroid space probe in 2014 to deliver several landing parts ( including minerva ii and german mobile asteroid surface scout ( mascot ) landers and a small carry-on impactor ( sci ) penetrator ) in 2018–2019 to return samples to earth by 2020 the lander would have carried a 7 & nbsp ; kg payload consisting of an imaging system ( a descent camera and a surface camera ) , a heat flow and physical properties package , an alpha particle x-ray spectrometer , a magnetometer , a seismometer , a soil penetrating device ( mole ) , and a micro-rover currently , the esa is planning to launch the jupiter icy moon explorer ( juice ) mission in 2022 , which includes the russian ganymede lander making a soft landing on ganymede around 2033 in addition , nasa offered the esa the opportunity to design a lander or impactor to fly alongside nasa 's proposed orbiter in the europa clipper mission planned for 2025 as europa is hypothesized to have water beneath its icy surface , missions are sent to investigate its habitability and assess its astrobiology potential by confirming the existence of water on the moon and determining the water 's characteristics despite the high radiation environment around europa and jupiter , which would cause issues for robotic surface missions , europa lander ( nasa ) mission is still under consideration and there is steady lobbying for future missions the moon impact probe ( mip ) developed by the indian space research organisation ( isro ) , india 's national space agency , was a moon probe that was released on 14 november 2008 by isro 's chandrayaan-1 lunar remote sensing orbiter the lunar crater observation and sensing satellite ( lcross ) was a robotic spacecraft operated by nasa to perform a lower-cost means of determining the nature of hydrogen detected at the polar regions of the moon the dart spacecraft will impact asteroid 65803 didymos 's moon dimorphos in 2022 , and the hera spacecraft will arrive in 2027 to investigate the effects of the impact
