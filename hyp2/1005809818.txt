when performing block-based discrete cosine transform ( dct ) coding for quantization , as in jpeg-compressed images , several types of artifacts can appear the transform ( for example the discrete cosine transform ) is applied to a block of pixels , and to achieve lossy compression , the transform coefficients of each block are quantized in the most extreme case only the dc-coefficient , that is the coefficient which represents the average color of a block , is retained , and the transform block is only a single color after reconstruction various approaches have been proposed to reduce image compression effects , but to use standardized compression/decompression techniques and retain the benefits of compression ( for instance , lower transmission and storage costs ) , many of these methods focus on '' post-processing '' —that is , processing images when received or viewed instead of just multiplying the quantized coefficients with the quantisation step pertaining to the 2d-frequency , intelligent noise in the form of a random number in the interval can be added to the dequantized coefficient when motion prediction is used , as in mpeg-1 , mpeg-2 or mpeg-4 , compression artifacts tend to remain on several generations of decompressed frames , and move with the optic flow of the image , leading to a peculiar effect , part way between a painting effect and '' grime '' that moves with objects in the scene data errors in the compressed bit-stream , possibly due to transmission errors , can lead to errors similar to large quantization errors , or can disrupt the parsing of the data stream entirely for a short time , leading to '' break-up '' of the picture video compression artifacts include cumulative results of compression of the comprising still images , for instance ringing or other edge busyness in successive still images appear in sequence as a shimmering blur of dots around edges , called mosquito noise , as they resemble mosquitoes swarming around the object p.930 ( 08/96 ) principles of a reference impairment system for video the so-called '' mosquito noise '' is caused by the block-based discrete cosine transform ( dct ) compression algorithm used in most video coding standards , such as the mpeg formats when the psychoacoustic model is inaccurate , when the transform block size is restrained , or when aggressive compression is used , this may result in compression artifacts compression artifacts in compressed audio typically show up as ringing , pre-echo , '' birdie artifacts '' , drop-outs , rattling , warbling , metallic ringing , an underwater feeling , hissing , or '' graininess '' rosa menkman 's glitch art makes use of compression artifacts , particularly the discrete cosine transform blocks ( dct blocks ) found in most digital media data compression formats such as jpeg digital images and mp3 digital audio , review : jpegs by thomas ruff , by jörg colberg , april 17 , 2009 in video art , one technique used is datamoshing , where two videos are interleaved so intermediate frames are interpolated from two separate sources
