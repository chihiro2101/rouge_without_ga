the catenary or messenger wire is hung at a specific tension between line structures , and a second wire is held in tension by the messenger wire , attached to it at frequent intervals by clamps and connecting wires known as droppers this is usually achieved by supporting the contact wire from a second wire known as the ( in the us & canada ) or catenary ( in the uk ) the presence of the earthed section in the middle is to ensure that should the transducer controlled apparatus fail , and the driver also fail to shut off power , the energy in the arc struck by the pantograph as it passes to the neutral section is conducted to earth , operating substation circuit breakers , rather than the arc either bridging the insulators into a section made dead for maintenance , a section fed from a different phase , or setting up a backdoor connection between different parts of the country 's national grid file:3rd rail to overhead wire transition zone on the skokie swift.jpg transition zone of third-rail to overhead-wire supply on chicago 's yellow line ( the '' skokie swift '' ) file : ama 103 at puhinui.jpg overhead lines in auckland , new zealand ( 25 kv ac ) file : nzr fp class khandallah.jpg overhead lines in wellington , new zealand ( 1500 & nbsp ; v dc ) file : lrt station south campus squared.jpg overhead lines on the edmonton capital line in a movable bridge that uses a rigid overhead rail , there is a need to transition from the catenary wire system into an overhead conductor rail at the bridge portal ( the last post before the movable bridge ) a catenary is a system of overhead wires used to supply electricity to a locomotive , tram ( streetcar ) , or light rail vehicle that is equipped with a pantograph in the united kingdom equipment similar to automatic warning system ( aws ) is used , but with pairs of magnets placed the running rails ( as opposed to the aws magnets placed midway between the rails ) this wire approximates the natural path of a wire strung between two points , a catenary curve , thus the use of '' catenary '' to describe this wire or sometimes the whole system to avoid this a midpoint anchor ( mpa ) , close to the centre of the tension length , restricts movement of the messenger/catenary wire by anchoring it ; the contact wire and its suspension hangers can move only within the constraints of the mpa occasionally gaps may be present in the overhead lines , when switching from one voltage to another or to provide clearance for ships at moveable bridges , as a cheaper alternative for moveable overhead power rails to be able to use different electric systems on shared tracks , the sihltal line has its overhead wire right above the train , whilst the uetliberg line has its overhead wire off to one side a simpler system was proposed in the 1970s by the pirelli construction company , consisting of a single wire embedded at each support for of its length in a clipped , extruded aluminum beam with the wire contact face exposed an early example was in the tunnels of the baltimore belt line , where a ∏ section bar ( fabricated from three strips of iron and mounted on wood ) was used , with the brass contact running inside the groove while a conventional rail line requires only the grade , ballast , ties and rails , an overhead system also requires a complex system of support structures , lines , insulators , power-control systems and power lines , all of which require maintenance the transition from section to section is known as a '' section break '' and is set up so that the vehicle 's pantograph is in continuous contact with one wire or the other this wire is attached to the contact wire at regular intervals by vertical wires known as '' droppers '' or '' drop wires '' for low speeds and in tunnels where temperatures are constant , fixed termination ( ft ) equipment may be used , with the wires terminated directly on structures at each end of the overhead line in the swiss village of oberentfelden , the menziken–aarau–schöftland line operating at 750 v dc crosses the sbb line at 15 kv ac ; there used to be a similar crossing between the two lines at suhr but this was replaced by an underpass in 2010 in cleveland , ohio the rta rapid transit lines and the heavy rail line use the same overhead wires , due to a city ordinance intended to limit air pollution from the large number of steam trains that passed through cleveland between the east coast and chicago the second wire is straight and level , parallel to the rail track , suspended over it as the roadway of a suspension bridge is over water when cleveland constructed its rapid transit ( heavy rail ) line between the airport , downtown , and beyond , it employed a similar catenary , using electrification equipment left over after railroads switched from steam to diesel file : imu 184.jpg overhead lines in queensland , australia file : overhead lines , puidoux.jpg overhead lines on swiss federal railways file : jungfraubahn with eiger.jpg overhead lines ( three-phase ) on jungfrau railway , switzerland file : overhead-lines-railway.jpg overhead lines in china file : overhead line nw england.jpg overhead lines in nw england file : railway-electrification.jpg overhead lines in denmark near roskilde in countries such as france , south africa and the united kingdom , a pair of permanent magnets beside the rails at either side of the neutral section operate a bogie-mounted transducer on the train which causes a large electrical circuit-breaker to open and close when the locomotive or the pantograph vehicle of a multiple unit passes over them ac systems have a particular safety implication in that the railway electrification system would act as a '' backdoor '' connection between different parts , resulting in , amongst other things , a section of the grid de-energised for maintenance being re-energised from the railway substation creating danger to allow maintenance to the overhead line without having to turn off the entire system , the line is broken into electrically separated portions known as '' sections '' with at the continuous length of overhead line is limited due to the change in the height of the weights as the overhead line expands and contracts with temperature changes when the bridge is fully closed , the motor of the rotary overlap is operated to turn it from a tilted position into the horizontal position , connecting the conductor rails at the transition end section and the bridge together to supply power compound equipment uses a second support wire , known as the '' auxiliary '' , between the messenger/catenary wire and the contact wire trams and railways use the overhead line as one side of the circuit and the steel rails as the other side of the circuit all systems with multiple overhead lines have high risk of short circuits at switches and therefore tend to be impractical in use , especially when high voltages are used or when trains run through the points at high speed in normal service , the two sections are electrically connected ; depending on the system this might be an isolator , fixed contact or a booster transformer ) unlike simple overhead wires , in which the uninsulated wire is attached by clamps to closely spaced crosswires supported by poles , catenary systems use at least two wires sometimes on a larger electrified railway , tramway or trolleybus system it is necessary to power different areas of track from different power grids , without guaranteeing synchronisation of the phases to enable higher speeds , two additional types of equipment were developed : stitched equipment uses an additional wire at each support structure , terminated on either side of the messenger/catenary wire for these reasons neutral sections are placed in the electrification between the sections fed from different points in a national grid , or different phases , or grids which are not synchronized the messenger wire is terminated at the portal , while the contact wire runs into the overhead conductor rail profile at the transition end section before it is terminated at the portal such long lines require enormous investment in overhead line equipment , and major difficulties confront energizing long portions of overhead wire on a permanent basis , especially in areas where energy demand already outstrips supply catenary systems are suited to high-speed operations whereas simple wire systems , which are less expensive to build and maintain , are common on light rail or tram ( streetcar ) lines , especially on city streets these were an experimental railway line of siemens in berlin-lichtenberg in 1898 ( length 1.8 kilometres ) , the military railway between marienfelde and zossen between 1901 and 1904 ( length 23.4 kilometres ) and an 800-metre-long section of a coal railway near cologne between 1940 and 1949 much simpler and more functional was an overhead wire in combination with a pantograph borne by the vehicle and pressed at the line from below for a trolleybus or a trolleytruck , no rails are available for the return current , as the vehicles use rubber tyres on the road surface an additional issue with at equipment is that , if balance weights are attached to both ends , the whole tension length is free to move along the track in zürich , switzerland , vbz trolleybus line 32 has a level crossing with the 1,200 v dc uetliberg railway line ; at many places , trolleybus lines cross the tramway
