the beginnings of algebraic number theory can be traced to diophantine equations , stark , pp a typical diophantine problem is to find two integers x and y such that their sum , and the sum of their squares , equal two given numbers a and b , respectively : : a x + y\ : b x^2 + y^2.\ diophantine equations have been studied for thousands of years the unsolved problem stimulated the development of algebraic number theory in the 19th century and the proof of the modularity theorem in the 20th century one of the founding works of algebraic number theory , the disquisitiones arithmeticae ( latin : arithmetical investigations ) is a textbook of number theory written in latin by carl friedrich gauss in 1798 when gauss was 21 and first published in 1801 when he was 24 based on his research of the structure of the unit group of quadratic fields , he proved the dirichlet unit theorem , a fundamental result in algebraic number theory he first used the pigeonhole principle , a basic counting argument , in the proof of a theorem in diophantine approximation , later named after him dirichlet 's approximation theorem in 1863 , he published lejeune dirichlet 's lectures on number theory as vorlesungen Ã¼ber zahlentheorie ( '' lectures on number theory '' ) about which it has been written that : '' although the book is assuredly based on dirichlet 's lectures , and although dedekind himself referred to the book throughout his life as dirichlet 's , the book itself was entirely written by dedekind , for the most part after dirichlet 's death ) dedekind defined an ideal as a subset of a set of numbers , composed of algebraic integers that satisfy polynomial equations with integer coefficients the early reciprocity laws found in the 19th century were usually expressed in terms of a power residue symbol ( p/q ) generalizing the legendre symbol , that describes when a prime number is an nth power residue modulo another prime , and gave a relation between ( p/q ) and ( q/p ) hilbert reformulated the reciprocity laws as saying that a product over p of hilbert symbols ( a , b/p ) , taking values in roots of unity , is equal to 1
