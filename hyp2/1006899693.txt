sound clash : jamaican dancehall culture at large by carolyn cooper , social and political changes in late-1970s jamaica , including the change from the socialism government of michael manley ( people 's national party ) to edward seaga ( jamaica labour party ) , were reflected in the shift away from the more internationally oriented roots reggae towards a style geared more towards local consumption and in tune with the music that jamaicans had experienced when sound systems performed live according to carolyn cooper in sound clash , written in 2004 , dancehall music and its following were frequently attacked for frequent references to guns and violence in lyrics , with cooper responding by arguing that the emergence of firearms was less a sign of genuinely violent undercurrents in dancehall and more a theatrical adoption of the role of guns as tools of power dancehall saw a new wave of popularity in western markets in the mid-late 2010s , with immense commercial success being achieved by a number of dancehall-pop singles , including rihanna 's '' work '' ( 2016 ) and drake 's '' one dance '' and '' controlla '' ( 2016 ) the success of music was n't just in the hands of one person anymore , it was a factor of the dj , speaking poetic words to the audience , the selector , harmonizing beats in an aesthetically pleasing way , and the sound engineer , wiring the sound systems to handle deeper and louder bass tones the international backlash to banton 's violently anti-homosexual '' boom bye-bye '' , and the reality of kingston 's violence which saw the deaths of deejays pan head and dirtsman saw another shift , this time back towards rastafari and cultural themes , with several of the hardcore slack ragga artists finding religion , and the '' conscious ragga '' scene becoming an increasingly popular movement hope argues that this trend is related to the rise of market capitalism as a dominant feature of life in jamaica , coupled with the role of new media and a liberalized media landscape , where images become of increasing importance in the lives of ordinary jamaicans who strive for celebrity and superstar status on the stages of dancehall and jamaican popular culture some of jamaica 's significant memories of itself are inscribed in the dancehall space , and therefore dancehall can be seen as a site of collective memory that functions as ritualized memorializing , a memory bank of the old , new , and dynamic bodily movements , spaces , performers , and performance aesthetics of the new world and jamaica in particular uwi press , 2006 dancehall culture actively creates a space for its '' affectors '' ( creators of dancehall culture ) and its '' affectees '' ( consumers of dancehall culture ) to take control of their own representation , contest conventional relationships of power , and exercise some level of cultural , social and even political autonomy sonjah stanley-niaah , in her article '' mapping black atlantic performance geographies '' , says dancehall occupies multiple spatial dimensions ( urban , street , police , marginal , gendered , performance , liminal , memorializing , communal ) , which are revealed through the nature and type of events and venues , and their use and function danger , a dancehall queen and the winner of the international dancehall queen competition in 2014 , expresses her power through dancehalls as she explains : “ we are queens , we are not afraid to go out there to do what we want to , demand what we want , and to live how we want , and represent women all over the world and to let them know it is okay to be yourself and that it is ok to not hold back ” refinery 29 , “ how jamaican dancehall queens twerk for a living style out there refinery29 she details the particular importance of the phrase '' out and bad '' to jamaica when she writes , “ this phrase is of queer hermeneutical possibility in jamaican dancehall because it registers a dialectic between queer and gay that is never resolved , that relays back and forth , producing an uncertainty about sexual identity and behavior that is usefully maintained in the jamaican popular cultural context thus , dancehall in jamaica is yet another example of the way that the music and dance cultures of the african diaspora have challenged the passive consumerism of mass cultural forms , such as recorded music , by creating a sphere of active cultural production that potentially may transform the prevailing hegemony of society examples of such dances are : '' like glue '' , '' bogle '' , '' whine & dip '' , '' tek weh yuhself '' , '' whine up '' , '' shake it with shaun '' ( a mix of various genres ) , '' boosie bounce '' , '' drive by '' , '' shovel it '' , '' to di world '' , '' dutty wine '' , '' sweep '' , '' nuh behavior '' , '' nuh linga '' , '' skip to my lou '' , '' gully creepa '' , '' breakdancing '' , '' bad man forward bad man pull up '' , '' keeping it jiggy '' , '' pon di river '' , '' one drop '' , '' whine & kotch '' , '' bubbling '' , '' tic toc '' , '' willie bounce '' , '' wacky dip '' , '' screetchie '' , '' one vice '' and '' daggering '' a variety of western artists have spoken of being inspired by dancehall music , including major lazer , whose commercially successful singles lean on ( 2015 ) , light it up ( 2015 ) and run up ( 2017 ) all heavily rely upon dancehall music two major elements of jamaican dancehall music are the use of digital instruments , particularly the casio casio mt-40 electronic keyboard , and the use of riddims , instrumentals to which lyrics are added , resulting in an unusual process of creating songs from separate components a new set of producers also came to prominence : philip '' fatis '' burrell , dave kelly ( producer ) , george phang , hugh '' redman '' james , donovan germain , bobby digital , wycliffe '' steely '' johnson and cleveland '' clevie '' brown ( aka steely & clevie ) rose to challenge sly &

self is shifting , fluid , adaptive , and malleable , and it involves the socioexistential imperative to transcend the normal ( i.e 401-423 the term gangsta ras , which combines thuggish imagery with

admiral tibet , frankie paul , half pint , courtney melody , and barrington levy were popular in jamaica part of the criticism of jamaican dancehall appears to be the product of cultural clash stemming from a lack of insider knowledge on the nuances of the music ’ s content and the culture surrounding said music peter manuel and wayne marshall noted in 2006 that most songs were set to one of about a dozen riddims that were in vogue , with the exceptions being the work of individual , often high-ranked , artists by the early 2000s , dancehall had gained mainstream popularity in jamaica , as well as in the united states , canada , australasia and western parts of europe appearance at dance halls was exceedingly important to acceptance by peers and encompassed everything from clothing and jewelry , to the types of vehicles driven , to the sizes of each respective gang or '' crew '' , and was equally important to both sexes recording over riddims forms the basis of dancehall , with modern dancehall layering vocals over ostinatos ; the djs providing the vocals thus , in the words of manuel and marshall , carry the song , unlike older dancehall where vocals were interwoven with full songs , the speed imperative ) the end justifies the means it strives to make the unseen visible objects and events that are external to the body are more important than internal processes ; what is seen is more important than what is thought ( i.e in the documentary it 's all about dancing , prominent dancehall artist beenie man argues that one could be the best dj or the smoothest dancer ,
