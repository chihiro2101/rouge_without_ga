long-wave infrared ( lwir ) cameras , sometimes called '' far-infrared '' , operate at 8 to 12 & nbsp ; μm and can see heat sources , such as hot engine parts or human body heat , several kilometers away to remedy this , the response of each pixel is measured at the factory , and a transform , most often linear , maps the measured input signal to an output level thermal imaging cameras , such as the raytheon an/aaq-26 , are used in a variety of applications , including naval vessels , fixed-wing aircraft , helicopters , and armored fighting vehicles in warfare , they have three distinct advantages over other imaging technologies : the imager itself is nearly impossible to detect for the enemy , as it detects energy emitted from the target rather than sending out energy that is reflected from the target , as with radar or sonar the term '' forward-looking '' is used to distinguish fixed forward-looking thermal imaging systems from sideways-tracking infrared systems , also known as '' push broom '' imagers , and other thermal imaging systems such as gimbal-mounted imaging systems , handheld imaging systems and the like sideways-tracking imagers normally involve a one-dimensional ( 1d ) array of pixels , which uses the motion of the aircraft or satellite to move the view of the 1d array across the ground to build up a 2d image over time in 1956 texas instruments began research on infrared technology that led to several line scanner contracts and , with the addition of a second scan mirror , the invention of the first forward-looking infrared camera in 1963 , with production beginning in 1966 current directions in sensor technologies at nvesd , keynote presentation at spie dss ir technology & applications xli conference , baltimore , 20–23 april 2015 ( distribution statement a : approved for public release ) also , older camera designs used rotating mirrors to scan the image to a small sensor in 2001 , the united states supreme court decided that performing surveillance of private property ( ostensibly to detect high emission grow lights used in clandestine cannabis farming ) using thermal imaging cameras without a search warrant by law enforcement violates the fourth amendment 's protection from unreasonable searches and seizures fbi spy planes used thermal imaging tech in flights over baltimore after freddie gray unrest , the washington post , october 30 , 2015 a flir talon multi-sensor camera system equipped with an infrared laser pointer ( which is invisible to casual observers ) for illumination purposes was used to gather data at night
