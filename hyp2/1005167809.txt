in plant biology , pectin consists of a complex set of polysaccharides ( see below ) that are present in most primary cell walls and are particularly abundant in the non-woody parts of terrestrial plants pectin is a major component of the middle lamella , where it helps to bind cells together , but is also found in primary cell walls the amount , structure and chemical composition of pectin differs among plants , within a plant over time , and in various parts of a plant during fruit ripening , pectin is broken down by the enzymes pectinase and pectinesterase , in which process the fruit becomes softer as the middle lamellae break down and cells become separated from each other a study found that after consumption of fruit the concentration of methanol in the human body increased by as much as an order of magnitude due to the degradation of natural pectin ( which is esterified with methyl alcohol ) in the colon substituted galacturonans are characterized by the presence of saccharide appendant residues ( such as d-xylose or d-apiose in the respective cases of xylogalacturonan and apiogalacturonan ) branching from a backbone of d-galacturonic acid residues the ratio of esterified to non-esterified galacturonic acid determines the behavior of pectin in food applications - hm-pectins can form a gel under acidic conditions in the presence of high sugar concentrations , while lm-pectins form gels by interaction with divalent cations , particularly ca 2+ , according to the idealized ‘ egg box ’ model , in which ionic bridges are formed between calcium ions and the ionised carboxyl groups of the galacturonic acid pears , apples , guavas , quince , plums , gooseberries , and oranges and other citrus fruits contain large amounts of pectin , while soft fruits , like cherries , grapes , and strawberries , contain small amounts of pectin typical levels of pectin in fresh fruits and vegetables are : apples , 1–1.5 % apricots , 1 % cherries , 0.4 % oranges , 0.5–3.5 % carrots 1.4 % citrus peels , 30 % rose hips , 15 % herbal drugs and phytopharmaceuticals , prof an old technique of precipitating pectin with aluminium salts is no longer used ( apart from alcohols and polyvalent cations , pectin also precipitates with proteins and detergents ) after drying and milling , pectin is usually standardised with sugar , and sometimes calcium salts or organic acids , to optimize performance in a particular application the main use for pectin is as a gelling agent , thickening agent and stabilizer in food for household use , pectin is an ingredient in gelling sugar ( also known as '' jam sugar '' ) where it is diluted to the right concentration with sugar and some citric acid to adjust ph in some countries , pectin is also available as a solution or an extract , or as a blended powder , for home jam making pectin can also be used to stabilize acidic protein drinks , such as drinking yogurt , to improve the mouth-feel and the pulp stability in juice based drinks and as a fat substitute in baked goods typical levels of pectin used as a food additive are between 0.5 and 1.0 % – this is about the same amount of pectin as in fresh fruit in ruminant nutrition , depending on the extent of lignification of the cell wall , pectin is up to 90 % digestible by bacterial enzymes , writing in chernobyl : consequences of the catastrophe for people and the environment , quote research conducted by the ukrainian center of radiation medicine and the belarusian institute of radiation medicine and endocrinology , concluded , regarding pectin 's radioprotective effects , that '' adding pectin preparations to the food of inhabitants of the chernobyl-contaminated regions promotes an effective excretion of incorporated radionuclides '' such as cesium-137 the printing process at first proved nearly impossible because the several layers of ink immediately ran , blurring outlines and rendering place names illegible until the inventor of the maps , clayton hutton , mixed a little pectin with the ink and at once the pectin coagulated the ink and prevented it from running , allowing small topographic features to be clearly visible at the joint fao/who expert committee report on food additives and in the european union , no numerical acceptable daily intake ( adi ) has been set , as pectin is considered safe pectin was first isolated and described in 1825 by henri braconnot , though the action of pectin to make jams and marmalades was known long before later , in the 1920s and 1930s , factories were built that commercially extracted pectin from dried apple pomace and later citrus peel in regions that produced apple juice in both the us and europe pectin was first sold as a liquid extract , but is now most often used as dried powder , which is easier than a liquid to store and handle
