international civil aviation organization - international standards and recommended practices - units of measurement to be used in air and ground operations - annex 5 to the convention on international civil aviation for historical reasons , other units such as miles per hour ( mph ) , knots ( kn ) measuring wind speed in knots '' the reason why sea winds are measured in knots at all has to do with maritime tradition '' or feet per second ( ft/s ) are also sometimes used to measure wind speeds wind speed is affected by a number of factors and situations , operating on varying scales ( from micro to macro scales ) it is vital to wind speed , because the greater the difference in pressure , the faster the wind flows ( from the high to low pressure ) to balance out the variation local weather conditions play a key role in influencing wind speed , as the formation of hurricanes , monsoons and cyclones as freak weather conditions can drastically affect the flow velocity of the wind the fastest wind speed not related to tornadoes ever recorded was during the passage of tropical cyclone olivia on 10 april 1996 : an automatic weather station on barrow island , australia , registered a maximum wind gust of the wind gust was evaluated by the wmo evaluation panel who found that the anemometer was mechanically sound and the gust was within statistical probability and ratified the measurement in 2010 a method of estimating speed is to use doppler on wheels to sense the wind speeds remotely , and , using this method , the figure of during the 1999 bridge creekâ€“moore tornado in oklahoma on 3 may 1999 is often quoted as the highest-recorded surface wind speed , although another figure of has also been quoted for the same tornado unlike traditional cup and vane anemometers , ultrasonic wind sensors have no moving parts and are therefore used to measure wind speed in applications that require maintenance-free performance , such as on the top of wind turbines by measuring the amount of phase shift in the received signals by each transducer , and then by mathematically processing the data , the sensor is able to provide an accurate horizontal measurement of wind speed and direction in the united states , the wind speed used in design is often referred to as a '' 3-second gust '' which is the highest sustained gust over a 3-second period having a probability of being exceeded per year of 1 in 50 ( asce 7-05 , updated to asce 7-16 ) the reference wind pressure ( q ) is calculated in pascals using the following equation : q ( 1/2 ) pv 2 where p is the air density in kg/m 3 and v is wind speed in m/s to convert wind speeds from one averaging time to another , the durst curve was developed which defines the relation between probable maximum wind speed averaged over t seconds , v t , and mean wind speed over one hour v 3600
