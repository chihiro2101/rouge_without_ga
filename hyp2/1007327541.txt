a chart can take a large variety of forms , however there are common features that provide the chart with its ability to extract meaning from data typically the data in a chart is represented graphically , since humans are generally able to infer meaning from pictures more quickly than from text for example , '' distance traveled ( m ) '' is a typical x-axis label and would mean that the distance traveled , in units of meters , is related to the horizontal position of the data within the chart the data of a chart can appear in all manner of formats , and may include individual textual labels describing the datum associated with the indicated position in the chart when the data appearing in a chart contains multiple variables , the chart may include a legend ( also known as a key ) four of the most common charts are : file : black cherry tree histogram.svg histogram file : försäljningsstatistik för blanddrycker.png bar chart file : actionnariatlibe2007-fr.svg pie chart file : us trade balance from 1960.svg line chart this gallery shows : a histogram consists of tabular frequencies , shown as adjacent rectangles , erected over discrete intervals ( bins ) , with an area equal to the frequency of the observations in the interval ; first introduced by karl pearson svg radar chart file : heatmap incito.png tree map file : lastgraph example.svg streamgraph file : gapchart-top14-2013-2014.png gapchart this gallery shows : a bubble chart is a two-dimensional scatterplot where a third variable is represented by the size of the points a radar chart or '' spider chart '' or '' doi '' is a two-dimensional chart of three or more quantitative variables represented on axes starting from the same point some types of charts have specific uses in a certain field file : bollinger bands example , 2 stddevs.png open-high-low-close chart file : candlestick-chart.png candlestick chart file : kagisample2chart echarts.gif kagi chart file : sparkline dowjones.svg sparkline this gallery shows : stock market prices are often depicted with an open-high-low-close chart with a traditional bar chart of volume at the bottom some of the better-known named charts are : file : gantt przyklad 2.png gantt chart file : nolan-chart.svg nolan chart file:5n pert graph with critical path.svg pert chart file : smith chart bmd.gif smith chart some specific charts have become well known by effectively explaining a phenomenon or idea while charts can be drawn by hand , computer software is often used to automatically produce a chart based on entered data
