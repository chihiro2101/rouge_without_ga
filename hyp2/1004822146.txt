thermal radiation is the emission of electromagnetic waves from all matter that has a temperature greater than absolute zero the characteristics of thermal radiation depend on various properties of the surface from which it is emanating , including its temperature , its spectral emissivity , as expressed by kirchhoff 's law if the radiating body and its surface are in thermodynamic equilibrium and the surface has perfect absorptivity at all wavelengths , it is characterized as a black body the ratio of any body 's emission relative to that of a black body is the body 's emissivity , so that a black body has an emissivity of unity ( i.e wien 's displacement law , and the fact that the frequency is inversely proportional to the wavelength , indicates that the peak frequency f max is proportional to the absolute temperature t of the black body the photosphere of the sun , at a temperature of approximately 6000 & nbsp ; k , emits radiation principally in the ( human- ) visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum it is this spectral selectivity of the atmosphere that is responsible for the planetary greenhouse effect , contributing to global warming and climate change in general ( but also critically contributing to climate stability when the composition and properties of the atmosphere are not changing ) lighter colors and also whites and metallic substances absorb less of the illuminating light , and as a result heat up less ; but otherwise color makes little difference as regards heat transfer between an object at everyday temperatures and its surroundings , since the dominant emitted wavelengths are nowhere near the visible spectrum , but rather in the far infrared there are 4 main properties that characterize thermal radiation ( in the limit of the far field ) : thermal radiation emitted by a body at any temperature consists of a wide range of frequencies even at a white-hot temperature of 2000 k , 99 % of the energy of the radiation is still in the infrared the total amount of radiation of all frequency increases steeply as the temperature rises ; it grows as t 4 , where t is the absolute temperature of the body an object at the temperature of a kitchen oven , about twice the room temperature on the absolute temperature scale ( 600 k vs the total radiative intensity of a black body rises as the fourth power of the absolute temperature , as expressed by the stefanâ€“boltzmann law the rate of electromagnetic radiation emitted at a given frequency is proportional to the amount of absorption that it would experience by the source , a property known as reciprocity this principle applies to all properties of the wave , including wavelength ( color ) , direction , polarization , and even coherence , so that it is quite possible to have thermal radiation which is polarized , coherent , and directional , though polarized and coherent forms are fairly rare in nature far from sources ( in terms of wavelength ) the general properties of thermal radiation as described by the planck 's law apply if the linear dimension of all parts considered , as well as radii of curvature of all surfaces are large compared with the wavelength of the ray considered ' ( typically from 8-25 micrometres for the emitter at 300 k ) planck 's law of thermal radiation has been challenged in recent decades by predictions and successful demonstrations of the radiative heat transfer between objects separated by nanoscale gaps that deviate significantly from the law predictions to achieve the required level of photon confinement , the dimensions of the radiating objects should be on the order of or below the thermal wavelength predicted by planck 's law most importantly , the emission spectrum of thermal wells , wires and dots deviates from planck 's law predictions not only in the near field , but also in the far field , which significantly expands the range of their applications
