it is new latin from ancient greek κάρυον karyon , '' kernel '' , '' seed '' , or '' nucleus '' , and τύπος typos , '' general form '' ) the next stage took place after the development of genetics in the early 20th century , when it was appreciated that chromosomes ( that can be observed by karyotype ) were the carrier of genes in 1922 seems to have been the first person to define the karyotype as the phenotypic appearance of the somatic chromosomes , in contrast to their gene contents investigation into the human karyotype took many years to settle the most basic question : how many chromosomes does a normal diploid human cell contain ? in 1912 , hans von winiwarter reported 47 chromosomes in spermatogonia and 48 in oogonia , concluding an xx/xo sex determination mechanism painter in 1922 was not certain whether the diploid of humans was 46 or 48 , at first favoring 46 , but revised his opinion from 46 to 48 , and he correctly insisted on humans having an xx/xy system joe hin tjio working in albert levan 's lab found the chromosome count to be 46 using new techniques available at the time : using cells in tissue culture pretreating cells in a hypotonic solution , which swells them and spreads the chromosomes arresting mitosis in metaphase by a solution of colchicine squashing the preparation on the slide forcing the chromosomes into a single plane cutting up a photomicrograph and arranging the result into an indisputable karyogram usually , a suitable dye , such as giemsa , a preparation which includes the dyes methylene blue , eosin y and azure-a , b , c is applied after cells have been arrested during cell division by a solution of colchicine usually in metaphase or prometaphase when most condensed these differences could have resulted from successive unequal translocations which removed all the essential genetic material from a chromosome , permitting its loss without penalty to the organism ( the dislocation hypothesis ) or through fusion human chromosome 2 appears to have resulted from the fusion of two ancestral chromosomes , and many of the genes of those two original chromosomes have been translocated to other chromosomes a full account of a karyotype may therefore include the number , type , shape and banding of the chromosomes , as well as other cytogenetic information variation is often found : between the sexes , between the germ-line and soma ( between gametes and the rest of the body ) , between members of a population ( polymorphism ( biology ) ) , in allopatric speciation , and in mosaics or otherwise abnormal individuals the most common karyotypes for females contain two x chromosomes and are denoted 46 , xx ; males usually have both an x and a y chromosome denoted 46 , xy although the replication and transcription of dna is highly standardized in eukaryotes , the same can not be said for their karyotypes , which are highly variable there is variation between species in chromosome number , and in detailed organization , despite their construction from the same chromatin in a review , godfrey and masters conclude : although much is known about karyotypes at the descriptive level , and it is clear that changes in karyotype organization has had effects on the evolutionary course of many species , it is quite unclear what the general significance might be in this process , found in some copepods and roundworms such as ascaris suum , portions of the chromosomes are cast away in particular cells in placental mammals , the inactivation is random as between the two xs ; thus the mammalian female is a mosaic in respect of her x chromosomes in human females some 15 % of somatic cells escape inactivation , and the number of genes affected on the inactivated x chromosome varies between cells : in fibroblast cells up about 25 % of genes on the barr body escape inactivation the existence of supernumerary or b chromosomes means that chromosome number can vary even within one interbreeding population ; and aneuploids are another example , though in this case they would not be regarded as normal members of the population the fundamental number , fn , of a karyotype is the number of visible major chromosomal arms per set of chromosomes humans have fn 82 , due to the presence of five acrocentric chromosome pairs : 13 , 14 , 15 , 21 , and 22 ( the human y chromosome is also acrocentric ) the fundamental autosomal number or autosomal fundamental number , fna or an , of a karyotype is the number of visible major chromosomal arms per set of autosomes ( non-allosome ) polyploidy in lower plants ( ferns , horsetails and psilotales ) is also common , and some species of ferns have reached levels of polyploidy far in excess of the highest levels known in flowering plants the cells do not always contain exact multiples ( powers of two ) , which is why the simple definition 'an increase in the number of chromosome sets caused by replication without cell division ' is not quite accurate this process ( especially studied in insects and some higher plants such as maize ) may be a developmental strategy for increasing the productivity of tissues which are highly active in biosynthesis aneuploidy is the condition in which the chromosome number in the cells is not the typical number for the species classic examples in plants are the genus crepis , where the gametic ( haploid ) numbers form the series x 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , and 7 ; and crocus , where every number from x 3 to x 15 is represented by at least one species the structural variation may be associated with different numbers of chromosomes in different individuals , which occurs in the ladybird beetle chilocorus stigma , some mantids of the genus ameles , the european shrew sorex araneus there is some evidence from the case of the mollusc thais lapillus ( the dog whelk ) on the brittany coast , that the two chromosome morphs are adapted to different habitats the detailed study of chromosome banding in insects with polytene chromosomes can reveal relationships between closely related species : the classic example is the study of chromosome banding in hawaiian drosophila by hampton l although it would be possible for a single gravid female to colonise an island , it is more likely to have been a group from the same species unique banding patterns are used to identify chromosomes and to diagnose chromosomal aberrations , including chromosome breakage , loss , duplication , translocation or inverted segments in other words : the properties of the bonds and the specificity of the fluorochromes are not exclusively based on their affinity to regions rich in at rather , the distribution of at and the association of at with other molecules like histones , for example , influences the binding properties of the fluorochromes in the '' classic '' ( depicted ) karyotype , a dye , often giemsa ( g-banding ) , less frequently mepacrine , is used to stain bands on the chromosomes the critical region for this syndrome is deletion of p15.2 ( the locus on the chromosome ) , which is written as 46 , xx , del ( 5 ) ( p15.2 ) multicolor fish and the older spectral karyotyping are molecular cytogenetic techniques used to simultaneously visualize all the pairs of chromosomes in an organism in different colors fluorophore combinations are captured and analyzed by a fluorescence microscope using up to 7 narrow-banded fluorescence filters or , in the case of spectral karyotyping , by using an interferometer attached to a fluorescence microscope chromosome abnormalities can be numerical , as in the presence of extra or missing chromosomes , or structural , as in derivative chromosome , translocations , inversions , large-scale deletions or duplications numerical abnormalities , also known as aneuploidy , often occur as a result of nondisjunction during meiosis in the formation of a gamete ; trisomy , in which three copies of a chromosome are present instead of the usual two , are common numerical abnormalities both types of abnormalities can occur in gametes and therefore will be present in all cells of an affected person 's body , or they can occur during mitosis and give rise to a genetic mosaic individual who has some normal and some abnormal cells chromosomal abnormalities that lead to disease in humans include turner syndrome results from a single x chromosome ( 45 , x or 45 , x0 ) chromosomal abnormalities can also occur in cancerous cells of an otherwise genetically normal individual ; one well-documented example is the philadelphia chromosome , a translocation mutation commonly associated with chronic myelogenous leukemia and less often with acute lymphoblastic leukemia .
