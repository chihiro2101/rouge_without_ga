in his later career , edelman was noted for his theory of consciousness , documented in a trilogy of technical books and in several subsequent books written for a general audience , including bright air , brilliant fire ( 1992 ) , a universe of consciousness ( 2001 , with giulio tononi ) , wider than the sky ( 2004 ) and second nature : brain science and human knowledge ( 2007 ) after his nobel prize award , edelman began research into the regulation of primary cellular processes , particularly the control of cell growth and the development of multi-celled organisms , focussing on cell-to-cell interactions in early embryonic development and in the formation and function of the nervous system he defines reentry as the ongoing recursive dynamic interchange of signals that occurs in parallel between brain maps , and which continuously interrelates these maps to each other in time and space ( film clip : edelman demonstrates spontaneous group formation among neurons with re-entrant connections gerald edelman : '' from brain dynamics to consciousness : a prelude to the future of brain-based devices '' , video , ibm lecture on cognitive computing , june 2006 ) '' the first of edelman 's technical books , the mindful brain ( 1978 ) , develops his theory of neural darwinism , which is built around the idea of plasticity in the neural network in response to the environment research by edelman and his colleagues and rodney robert porter in the early 1960s produced fundamental breakthroughs in the understanding of the antibody 's chemical structure , opening a door for further study gerald edelman was born in 1929 in ozone park , queens , new york , to jewish parents , physician edward edelman , and anna ( née freedman ) edelman , who worked in the insurance industry edelman argues that this dynamic selective process is directly analogous to the processes of selection that act on populations of individuals in species , and he also points out that this functional plasticity is imperative , since not even the vast coding capability of entire human genome is sufficient to explicitly specify the astronomically complex synaptic structures of the developing brain for this work , edelman and porter shared the nobel prize in physiology or medicine in 1972 this process may strengthen or weaken the connections between groups of neurons and it is constrained by value signals that arise from the activity of the ascending systems of the brain , which are continually modified by successful output a sample of brain tissue the size of a match head contains about a billion connections , and if we consider how these neuronal connections might be variously combined , the number of possible permutations becomes hyper-astronomical – in the order of ten followed by millions of zeros developmental selection -- the formation of the gross anatomy of the brain is controlled by genetic factors , but in any individual the connectivity between neurons at the synaptic level and their organisation into functional neuronal groups is determined by somatic selection during growth and development he explicitly located his theory within charles darwin 's theory of natural selection , citing the key tenets of darwin 's population theory , which postulates that individual variation within species provides the basis for the natural selection that eventually leads to the evolution of new species experiential selection -- overlapping the initial growth and development of the brain , and extending throughout an individual 's life , a continuous process of synaptic selection occurs within the diverse repertoires of neuronal groups these studies led to the discovery of cell adhesion molecules ( cams ) , which guide the fundamental processes that help an animal achieve its shape and form , and by which nervous systems are built gerald edelman is a genius on a spiritual path '' - profile in san diego jewish journal , october 2007 '' from brain dynamics to consciousness '' , video , ibm lecture on cognitive computing , june 2006 , inactive as of jeffrey epstein vi foundation june 15 , 2013 the second book , topobiology ( 1988 ) , proposes a theory of how the original neuronal network of a newborn 's brain is established during development of the embryo one of the most significant discoveries made in this research is that the precursor gene for the neural cell adhesion molecule gave rise in evolution to the entire molecular system of adaptive immunity
