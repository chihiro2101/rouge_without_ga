most of the weight is therefore taken off the shoulders , reducing the chance of injury from shoulder strap pressure ( many backpacks equipped solely with shoulder straps can affect the posture of a person carrying more than 14 & nbsp ; kg ( 30 & nbsp ; lbs ) ) , as well as being less restrictive of the upper body range of motion the internal construction also allows for a large storage compartment ; a few lash points ( including webbing loops and straps for sleeping bags and other large items ) may be present , but as the frame is completely integrated , it is difficult to securely lash larger and heavier items which do not fit inside the compartment to the outside of the pack alternative names include haversack from the german hafersack meaning '' oat sack '' ( which more properly describes a small cloth bag on a strap worn over one shoulder and originally referred to the bag of oats carried as horse fodder ) , kraxe ( a german rucksack with a rigid framework ) , and bergen ( a large load-carrying rucksack , from a design issued by the british army during the second world war ) hydration packs , sometimes used by athletes and military personnel , carry water ( in either a bladder or a rigid bottle ) and have a tube connected to them from which the wearer can drink without removing the pack ; this feature is also included in some more general-purpose hiking backpacks sports and hydration backpacks are smaller with a profile closer to the body , wider straps and can come with water bladders and hip belts for running , cycling or hiking a bodypack is a backpack fitted with one or more pockets that are suspended on the wearer 's chest and loaded in such a way that the load in the front and the load in the back are close to equal while traditionally very simple in design , school backpacks are often made with padded shoulder straps and backs as well as additional reinforcement to hold large numbers of heavy textbooks , as well as safety features such as reflective panels to make the wearer of the pack more visible at night a pack frame , when present , serves to support the pack and distribute the weight of its contents across the body more appropriately , by transferring much of the weight to the hips and legs these light daypacks are especially designed to hold water in a special water bladder ( also known as reservoir ) , and their purpose is to allow the carrier constant fluid hydration handsfree , so that the carrier can focus on the mission ahead without having to stop for water breaks the internal frame permits the pack to fit closely to the wearer 's back and minimizes shifting of the load , which is desirable when participating in activities that involve upper-body movement such as scrambling over rocky surfaces and skiing in addition , the sack can often be removed entirely , permitting the user to customize the configuration of their load , or to transport a non-conventional load such as a quartered game animal because of their design , rolling backpacks reduce the strain on the user , though the shoulder straps may be used to carry the pack for short distances when the terrain is not suitable for wheels the internal frame backpack is a recent innovation , invented in 1967 by greg lowe , who went on to found lowe alpine and lowepro , companies specializing in backpacks and other forms of carrying bags for various equipment the straps of this backpack are wide enough to distribute the pressure on shoulders and also a white glass wool layer is added to the internal part of them to absorb dynamic forces , which could be produced through walking external frame packs were designed to carry heavy loads ( > 20 & nbsp ; kg or 40 & nbsp ; lb ) , giving the wearer more support and protection and better weight distribution than a simple , frameless strapped bag external frame packs have a fabric '' sack '' portion which is usually smaller than that of internal frame packs , but have exposed frame portions above and below the sack to accommodate attachment of larger items the external frame is typically made from aluminum , other lightweight metal alloy , and recently reinforced synthetic polymers or plastic and is equipped with a system of straps and tautly-stretched netting which prevents contact between the metal frame and user 's back common examples include backpacks for small valuable items such as laptops and cameras ; backpacks designed to hold laptop computers in particular generally have a padded compartment to hold the computer and medium-sized pockets and flaps to accommodate accessories such as charger cables and mice backpacks are a standard part of the load-bearing equipment of soldiers , especially infantry , in most countries , and military-style packs are regularly available to civilians in military surplus stores
