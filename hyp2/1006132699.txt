in many cases , the original sense of the new negative particle is not negative per se ( thus in french pas '' step '' , originally '' not a step '' '' not a bit '' ) , but in germanic languages , such as english and german the intermediate stage was a case of double negation , as the current negatives not and nicht in these languages originally meant '' nothing '' : e.g the only alternative would be using a negating subordinate clause and subjunctive in the main clause , which could be approximated in english as '' there has not ever been an instance that i would have owed anything to anyone '' ( nav bijis tā , ka es kādreiz būtu kādam bijis kaut ko parādā ) , where negative pronouns ( nekad , neviens , nekas ) are replaced by indefinite pronouns ( kādreiz , kāds , kaut kas ) more in line with the english '' ever , any '' indefinite pronoun structures such confusing sentences can then diplomatically soften or blur rejection or unpleasant information or even agreement , but at the expense of intelligibility : '' nelze nevidět '' ( '' it can n't be not seen '' ) , '' nejsem nespokojen '' ( '' i 'm not dissatisfied '' ) , '' není nezajímavý '' ( '' it/he is not uninteresting '' ) , '' nemohu nesouhlasit '' ( '' i ca n't disagree '' ) 130 a similar development to a circumfix from double negation can be seen in non-indo-european languages , too : for example , in maltese , kiel '' he ate '' is negated as ma kielx '' he did not eat '' , where the verb is preceded by a negative particle ma- '' not '' and followed by the particle -x , which was originally a shortened form of xejn '' nothing '' - thus , '' he did n't eat nothing '' for instance , '' i do n't disagree '' could mean '' i certainly agree '' , '' i agree '' , '' i sort of agree '' , '' i do n't understand your point of view ( pov ) '' , '' i have no opinion '' , and so on ; it is a form of '' weasel words '' '' in music , double negatives can be employed to similar effect ( as in pink floyd 's '' another brick in the wall '' , in which schoolchildren chant '' we do n't need no education / we do n't need no thought control '' ) or used to establish a frank and informal tone ( as in the rolling stones ' '' ( i ca n't get no ) satisfaction '' ) a few examples would be : איך האב קיינמאל נישט געזאגט ( '' i never did n't say '' ) איך האב נישט קיין מורא פאר קיינעם ניט ( '' i have no fear of no one not '' ) it is common to add נישט ( '' not '' ) after the yiddish word גארנישט ( '' nothing '' ) , i.e compared with '' 我必须走 '' ( wǒ bìxū zǒu , '' i must go '' ) , '' 我不得不走 '' ( wǒ bùdébù zǒu , '' i can not not go '' ) tries to emphasize that the situation is out of the speaker 's hands and that the speaker has no choice in the matter : '' unfortunately , i have got to go '' for example , in the serbo-croatian , ni ( t ) ko nikad ( a ) nigd ( j ) e ništa nije uradio ( '' nobody never did not do nothing nowhere '' ) means '' nobody has ever done anything , anywhere '' , and nikad nisam tamo išao/išla ( '' never i did not go there '' ) means '' i have never been there '' however , this doubleness is also transferred to forms where the verbal copula is released and the negation is joined to the nominal form , and such a phrase can be ambiguous : '' nikdo nezraněn '' ( '' nobody unscathed '' ) can mean both , '' nobody healthy '' as well as '' all healthy '' in spoken welsh , the word ddim ( not ) often occurs with a prefixed or mutated verb form that is negative in meaning : dydy hi ddim yma ( word-for-word , '' not-is she not here '' ) expresses '' she is not here '' and chaiff aled ddim mynd ( word-for-word , '' not-will-get aled not go '' ) expresses '' aled is not allowed to go '' the use of 'nor ' to emphasise the negative clause is still popular today , and has been popular in the past through the works of shakespeare and milton : : nor did they not perceive the evil plight : in which they were ~ john milton - paradise lost : i never was , nor never will be ~ william shakespeare - richard iii to the common reader the negatives herein do not cancel each other out but simply emphasizes the negative clause in asturian , an extra negative particle is used with negative adverbs : yo nunca nun lu viera ( '' i had not never seen him '' ) means '' i have never seen him '' and a mi tampoco nun me presta ( '' i neither do not like it '' ) means '' i do not like it either '' in czech , like in many other languages , a standard double negative is used in sentences with a negative pronoun or negative conjunction , where the verb is also negated ( '' nikdo nepřišel '' '' nobody came '' , literally '' nobody did n't come '' ) one common construction is 不得不 ( pinyin : bùdébù , '' can not not '' ) , which is used to express ( or feign ) a necessity more regretful and polite than that expressed by 必须 ( bìxū , '' must '' ) however , depending on how such a sentence is constructed , in some dialects if a verb or adverb is in between two negatives then the latter negative is assumed to be intensifying the former thus adding weight or feeling to the negative clause of the sentence for instance , while both voglio mangiare ( '' i want to eat '' ) and non voglio non mangiare ( '' i do n't want not to eat '' ) mean '' i want to eat '' , the latter phrase more precisely means '' i 'd prefer to eat '' when two negatives are used in one independent clause , in standard english the negatives are understood to cancel one another and produce a weakened affirmative ( see the robert lowth citation below ) : this is known as litotes '' this initial usage spread so thoroughly that it became a necessary element of any negation in the modern french language there are literary cases in which '' ne '' can be used without '' pas '' ; many of these are traditional phrases stemming from a time before the emphatic became an essential part of negation double or multiple negatives are grammatically required in hungarian with negative pronouns : nincs semmim ( word for word : '' doesn't-exists nothing-of-mine '' , and translates literally as '' i do not have nothing '' ) means '' i do not have anything '' saying '' i saw nobody '' in polish ( widziałem nikogo ) instead of the more usual '' i did not see nobody '' ( nikogo nie widziałem ) might mean '' i saw an instance of nobody '' or '' i saw mr nobody '' but it would not have its plain english meaning with few exceptions , a simple negative ( οὐ or μή ) following another negative ( for example , οὐδείς , no one ) results in an affirmation : οὐδείς οὐκ ἔπασχε τι ( '' no one was not suffering '' ) means more simply '' everyone was suffering '' this phenomenon is commonplace in finnish , where many words have alternatives that are required in negative expressions , for example edes for jopa ( '' even '' ) , as in jopa niin paljon meaning '' even so much '' , and ei edes niin paljoa meaning '' not even so much '' likewise , in slovenian , saying '' i do not know anyone '' in place of '' i do not know no one '' has the connotation '' i do not know just anyone '' : i know someone important or special standard catalan and galician also used to possess a tendency to double no with other negatives , so jo tampoc no l'he vista or eu tampouco non a vira , respectively ( '' i neither have not seen her '' ) meant '' i have not seen her either '' many languages , including all living germanic languages , french , welsh and some berber and arabic dialects , have gone through a process known as jespersen 's cycle , where an original negative particle is replaced by another , passing through an intermediate stage employing two particles ( e.g a sentence can otherwise usually only become positive through consecutive uses of negatives , such as those prescribed in the later examples , where a clause is void of a verb and lacks an adverb to intensify it the sentence '' nemohu se nikdy neoddávat nečinnosti '' ( '' i ca n't never not indulge in inaction '' ) contains 4 negations and it is very confusing which of them create a '' double negative '' and which of them eliminated from each other 21-36 however , in many cases , a double , triple quadruple negative can really work in such a way that each negative cancels out the next negative , and such a sentence may be a catch and may be incomprehensible to a less attentive or less intelligent addressee jamais , rien , personne and nulle part ( never , nothing , no one , nowhere ) can be mixed with each other , and/or with ne.plus ( not anymore/not again ) in french , e.g quadruple negatives further resolve to a positive meaning ; for example , '' 我不是不知道没人不喜欢他 '' ( wǒ bú shì bù zhīdào méi rén bù xǐhuan tā , '' i do not not know no one likes him not '' ) means '' i do know that everybody likes him '' , ik ne willen da nie doen , '' i do not want to do that '' ) and in some villages in the central netherlands such as garderen , it takes a different form than that found in afrikaans a notable exception is afrikaans , where it is mandatory ( for example , '' he can not speak afrikaans '' becomes hy kan nie afrikaans praat nie , '' he can not afrikaans speak not '' ) the sentence '' všichni tam nebyli '' ( '' all do n't were there '' ) means not '' all absented '' but '' there were not all '' ( '' at least one of them absenteed '' ) the particle is usually omitted in speech but the mutation remains : ni wyddai neb ( word-for-word , '' not not-knew nobody '' ) means '' nobody knew '' and ni chaiff aled fawr o bres ( word-for-word , '' not not-will-get aled lots of money '' ) means '' aled will not get much money '' meanwhile , a compound negative following a negative strengthens the negation : μὴ θορυβήσῃ μηδείς ( '' do not permit no one to raise an uproar '' ) means '' let not a single one among them raise an uproar '' where people think that the sentence i 'm not hungry no more resolves to a positive is where the latter negative no becomes an adjective which only describes its suffix counterpart more which effectively becomes a noun , instead of an adverb portuguese não vejo nada , spanish no veo nada , romanian nu văd nimic and italian non vedo niente in italian a simple negative phrase , non vedo alcunché ( '' i do n't see anything '' ) , is also possible '' ) another point of view is that this construction is not really an example of a '' double negative '' but simply a grammatical template for negation discussing english grammar , the term '' double negative '' is often , though not universally , applied to the non-standard use of a second negative as an intensifier to a negation the same applies to the third example , where the adverb 'more ' merges with the prefix no- to become a negative word , which when combined with the sentence 's former negative only acts as an intensifier to the verb hungry '' he has studied japanese , so he should be able to write kanji '' can be phrased 彼は日本語を勉強したから漢字で書けないわけがない ( kare wa nihongo o benkyō shita kara kanji de kakenai wake ga nai ) , there 's a rather harsher idea : '' as he 's studied japanese , the reasoning that he ca n't write kanji does n't exist '' the second term was originally an emphatic ; pas , for example , derives from the latin passus , meaning '' step '' , so that french je ne marche pas and catalan no camino pas originally meant '' i will not walk a single step robert lowth stated in his grammar textbook a short introduction to english grammar ( 1762 ) that '' two negatives in english destroy one another , or are equivalent to an affirmative ''
