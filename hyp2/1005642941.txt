an '' informal discussion of the concepts and definitions '' in a working paper published by food and agriculture organization of the united nations in 2014 reviewed english , spanish and french definitions of the concept of '' family farm '' definitions referred to one or more of labor , management , size , provision of family livelihood , residence , family ties and generational aspects , community and social networks , subsistence orientation , patrimony , land ownership and family investment the 2012 united states census of agriculture defines a family farm as '' any farm where the majority of the business is owned by the operator and individuals related to the operator , including relatives who do not live in the operator ’ s household '' ; it defines a farm as '' any place from which 1,000 or more of agricultural products were produced and sold , or normally would have been sold , during a given year for example , in the united states , under federal farm ownership loan regulations , the definition of a '' family farm '' does not specify the nature of farm ownership , and management of the farm is either by the borrower , or by members operating the farm when a loan is made to a corporation , co-operative or other entity in the roman republic , latifundia , great landed estates , specialised in agriculture destined for export , producing grain , olive oil , or wine , corresponding largely to modern industrialized agriculture but depending on slave labour instead of mechanization , developed after the second punic war and increasingly replaced the former system of family-owned small or intermediate farms in the roman empire period these latifundia had been of great importance economically , until the long-distance shipping of wine and oil , grain and garum disintegrated , but extensive lands controlled in a single pair of hands still constituted power : it can be argued that the latifundia formed part of the economic basis of the european social feudal system , taking the form of manorialism , the essential element of feudal society , '' feudal society '' , in its modern sense was coined in marc bloch 's 1939–40 books of the same name manorialism was characterised by the vesting of legal and economic power in a lord of the manor , supported economically from his own direct landholding in a manor ( sometimes called a fief ) , and from the obligatory contributions of a legally subject part of the peasant population under the jurisdiction of himself and his manorial court under the tenant system , a farm may be worked by the same family over many generations , but what is inherited is not the farm 's estate itself but the lease on the estate the germanic term for '' heritable estate , allodium '' was ōþalan ( old english ēþel ) , which incidentally was also used as a rune name ; the gnomic verse on this term in the anglo-saxon rune poem reads : : : '' an estate is very dear to every man , if he can enjoy there in his house whatever is right and proper in constant prosperity much of germanic europe has a history of overlap or conflict between the feudal system of manoralism , where the estate is owned by noblemen and leased to the tenants or worked by serfs , and the germanic system of free farmers working landed estates heritable within their clan or family in german-speaking europe , farming estates are known as hof ; this german word notably has the meaning of both '' farming estate '' and '' royal court '' , in origin referring to the building or hall at the center of any independent estate mechanization enabled the cultivation of much larger areas than what was typical for the traditional estates aimed at subsistence farming , resulting in the emergence of a smaller number of large farms , with the displaced population partly contributing to the new class of wage labour and partly emigrating to the new world or the russian empire ( following the serfdom in russia ) the family farms established in imperial russia were again collectivization in the soviet union , but the emigration of european farmers displaced by the industrial revolution contributed to the emergence of a system of family estates in the americas ( homestead act of 1862 ) for example , pat buchanan and ralph nader , both candidates for the office of president of the united states , held rural rallies together and spoke for measures to preserve the so-called family farm bolder promoters argue that as agriculture has become more efficient with the application of modern management and new technologies in each generation , the idealized classic family farm is now simply obsolete , or more often , unable to compete without the economies of scale available to larger and more modern farms two percent of farms are not family farms , and those two percent make up fourteen percent of total agricultural output in the united states , although half of them have total sales of less than 50,000 per year overall , ninety-one percent of farms in the united states are considered '' small family farms '' ( with sales of less than 250,000 per year ) , and those farms produce twenty-seven percent of u.s farms : numbers , size , and ownership '' depending on the type and size of independently owned operation , some limiting factors are : economies of scale : larger farms are able to bargain more competitively , purchase more competitively , profit from economic highs , and weather lows more readily through monetary inertia than smaller farms wholesale infrastructure : a farmer growing larger quantities of a crop than can be sold directly to consumers has to meet a range of criteria for sale into the wholesale market , which include harvest timing and graded quality , and may also include variety , therefore , the market channel really determines most aspects of the farm decisionmaking government economic intervention : in some countries , notably the us and eu , government subsidies to farmers , intended to mitigate the impact on domestic farmers of economic and political activities in other areas of the economy , can be a significant source of farm income real estate prices : the growth of urban centers around the world , and the resulting urban sprawl have caused the price of centrally located farmland to skyrocket , while reducing the local infrastructure necessary to support farming , putting effectively intense pressure on many farmers to sell out the availability of an increasingly diverse supply of fresh , uncured , unpreserved produce and meat in all seasons of the year ( oranges in january , freshly killed steers in july , fresh pork rather than salted , smoked , or potassium-impregnated ham ) opened an entirely new cuisine and an unprecedented healthy diet to millions of consumers who had never enjoyed such produce before a percentage of consumers have begun to question the viability of industrial agriculture practices and have turned to organic groceries that sell products produced on family farms including not only meat and produce but also such things as wheat germ breads and natural lye soaps ( as opposed to bleached white breads and petroleum based detergent bars ) in 2012 , the united states had 2,039,093 family farms ( as defined by usda ) , accounting for 97 percent of all farms and 89 percent of census farm area in the united states in 1988 mark friedberger warned , '' the farm family is a unique institution , perhaps the last remnant , in an increasingly complex world , of a simpler social order in which economic and domestic activities were inextricably bound together a usda survey conducted in 2011 estimated that family farms account for 85 percent of us farm production and 85 percent of us gross farm income several kinds of us family farms are recognized in usda farm typology : small family farms are defined as those with annual gross cash farm income ( gcfi ) of less than 350,000 ; in 2011 , these accounted for 90 percent of all us farms in canada , the number of '' family farms '' can not be inferred closely , because of the nature of census data , which do not distinguish family and non-family farm partnerships also , as in the us , family farm succession planning can use a partnership as a means of apportioning family farm tenure among family members when a sole proprietor is ready to transfer some or all of ownership and operation of a farm to offspring analysis of data for 59,000 farms in the 12 member states of the european community found that in 1989 , about three-quarters of the farms were family farms , producing just over half of total agricultural output analysis by teagasc ( ireland ’ s agriculture and food development authority ) estimates that 37 percent of irish farms are economically viable and an additional 30 percent are sustainable due to income from off-farm sources ; 33 percent meet neither criterion and are considered economically vulnerable the food and agriculture organization of the united nations was invited to facilitate its implementation , in collaboration with governments , international development agencies , farmers ' organizations and other relevant organizations of the united nations system as well as relevant non-governmental organizations the goal of the 2014 iyff is to reposition family farming at the centre of agricultural , environmental and social policies in the national agendas by identifying gaps and opportunities to promote a shift towards a more equal and balanced development
