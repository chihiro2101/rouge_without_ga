due to the loss of archives in 1695 and again in 1940 , there are few certain facts of van der weyden 's life campbell ( 1998 ) , 392 rogelet de le pasture ( roger of the pasture ) was born in tournai ( in present-day belgium ) in 1399 or 1400 from the second of march 1436 onward , he held the title of 'painter to the town of brussels ' ( stadsschilder ) , a very prestigious post because brussels was at that time the most important residence of the splendid court of the dukes of burgundy however , on 5 march of the following year , the records of the painters ' guild show a '' rogelet de le pasture '' entered the workshop of robert campin together with jacques daret clarke , 44 only five years later , on the first of august 1432 , de le pasture obtained the title of a '' master '' ( maistre ) painter in general , the close stylistic link between the documented works of jacques daret and the paintings attributed to robert campin and van der weyden are the main arguments to consider rogier van der weyden as a pupil of campin the final mention of rogier de la pasture in the financial records of tournai , on 21 october 1435 , lists him as demeurrant à brouxielles ( '' living in brussels '' ) after interventions from both the duke of burgundy and the dauphin of france , the future louis & nbsp ; xi , rogier van der weyden was persuaded to accept the request of bianca maria visconti , duchess of milan , that her court painter zanetto bugatto go to brussels to become an apprentice in his workshop lorne campbell , '' the new pictorial language of rogier van der weyden '' , in rogier van der weyden , master of passions , ed the triptych of the virgin or miraflores altarpiece , since 1850 in the gemäldegalerie , berlin , was given in 1445 to the charterhouse of miraflores near burgos by john ii of castile ; it was described in the deed of gift as the work of great and famous flandresco rogel dirk de vos , 232 , 291 rogier 's apprenticeship under campin instilled a number of preoccupations , most noticeably his approach to feminine beauty , which was often expressed both through the elegant form of the model herself as well as her dress the resemblance was to such an extent & nbsp ; – compare campin 's portrait of a womans similarity to rogier 's berlin portrait & nbsp ; – that campin 's works were for a period attributed to rogier 's early career van mander , who knew that rogier van der weyden resided in brussels , read vasari 's text and believed that there were two different artists with the same name , who both appear separately in his schilder-boeck of 1604 châtelet explains how the brussels archivist alphonse walters discovered in 1846 that there was a rogier van der weyden who lived in brussels but that he had died earlier than stated in the schilder-boeck ; this led alfred michiels to claim that there were two rogier van der weyden painters , a father and son a further complication arose at the end of the 19th century when william bode and hugo von tschudi attributed a group of works of art to the '' maître de flémalle '' ; despite discrepancies , these works are similar to those of van der weyden and so it was believed that these works were in fact by rogier and that he was the '' maître de flémalle '' there was still a divide in critical opinion over whether there was one rogier van der weyden or two artists , the other being rogier de la pasture of tournai , until erwin panofsky wrote his definitive work in 1953 early netherlandish painting and established that there was only one painter with two names he is first mentioned in historical records in 1427 when , relatively late in life , he studied painting under campin during 1427–32 , and soon outshone his master and , later , even influenced him some of his work from this period was attributed to 'rogelet de la pasture ' after his apprenticeship , he was made master of the tournai guild of st luke he completed his deposition in 1435 , which as he had deliberately intended , made him one of the most sought after and influential artists in northern europe and is still considered his masterpiece the fragment of the london national gallery 's the magdalen reading has been described by campbell as '' one of the great masterpieces of fifteenth-century art and among rogier 's most important early works '' campbell 1998 , 394 , 398 the lost the justice of trajan and herkinbald , which survived until the end of the 17th century , consisted of four large panels representing the justice of trajan and justice of herkenbald they were destroyed in the french bombardment of brussels in 1695 , but are known from many surviving descriptions , from a free partial copy in tapestry ( bern , historisches museum ) and from other free and partial copies in drawing and painting his vigorous , subtle , expressive painting and popular religious conceptions had considerable influence on european painting , not only in france and germany but also in italy and in spain van der weyden had also a large influence on the german painter and engraver martin schongauer whose prints were distributed all over europe from the last decades of the 15th century delenda writes that , with the exception of petrus christus , who was a disciple of jan van eyck , traces of rogier van der weyden 's art can be found in all fifteenth-century artists to varying degrees 1450 ) , oil on oak panel , 45 × 35 & nbsp ;
