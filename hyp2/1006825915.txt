the concept of reconfigurable computing has existed since the 1960s , when gerald estrin 's paper proposed the concept of a computer made of a standard processor and an array of '' reconfigurable '' hardware this resulted in a hybrid computer structure combining the flexibility of software with the speed of hardware and wawrzynek , john , '' garp : a mips processor with a reconfigurable coprocessor '' , proceedings of the ieee symposium on field-programmable custom computing machines ( fccm '97 , april 16–18 , 1997 ) , pp the fundamental model of the reconfigurable computing machine paradigm , the data-stream-based anti machine is well illustrated by the differences to other machine paradigms that were introduced earlier , as shown by nick tredennick 's following classification scheme of computing paradigms ( see '' table 1 : nick tredennick ’ s paradigm classification scheme '' ) computer scientist reiner hartenstein describes reconfigurable computing in terms of an anti-machine that , according to him , represents a fundamental paradigm shift away from the more conventional von neumann machine hartenstein calls it reconfigurable computing paradox , that software-to-configware ( software-to-fpga ) migration results in reported speed-up factors of up to more than four orders of magnitude , as well as a reduction in electricity consumption by up to almost four orders of magnitude—although the technological parameters of fpgas are behind the moore 's law by about four orders of magnitude , and the clock frequency is substantially lower than that of microprocessors high-performance reconfigurable computing ( hprc ) is a computer architecture combining reconfigurable computing-based accelerators like field-programmable gate array with cpus or multi-core processors the attachment of such an fpga to a modern cpu over a high speed bus , like pci express , has enabled the configurable logic to act more like a coprocessor rather than a peripheral furthermore , by replicating an algorithm on an fpga or the use of a multiplicity of fpgas has enabled reconfigurable simd systems to be produced where several computational devices can concurrently operate on different data , which is highly parallel computing from the functionality of the design , partial reconfiguration can be divided into two groups : dynamic partial reconfiguration , also known as an active partial reconfiguration - permits to change the part of the device while the rest of an fpga is still running ; static partial reconfiguration - the device is not active during the reconfiguration process while the partial data is sent into the fpga , the rest of the device is stopped ( in the shutdown mode ) and brought up after the configuration is completed such projects are built with reconfigurable hardware ( fpgas ) , and some devices support emulation of multiple vintage computers using a single reconfigurable hardware ( c-one ) the mitrion-c software language and mitrion processor enable software developers to write and execute applications on fpga-based computers in the same manner as with other computing technologies , such as graphical processing units ( “ gpus ” ) , cell-based processors , parallel processing units ( “ ppus ” ) , multi-core cpus , and traditional single-core cpu clusters the intel fpga partial reconfiguration flow for arria 10 is based on the hierarchical design methodology in the quartus prime pro software where users create physical partitions of the fpga that can be reconfigured at runtime while the remainder of the design continues to operate the granularity of the reconfigurable logic is defined as the size of the smallest functional unit ( configurable logic block , clb ) that is addressed by the mapping tools often the type of applications to be run are known in advance allowing the logic , memory and routing resources to be tailored to enhance the performance of the device whilst still providing a certain level of flexibility for future adaptation compression of the bit stream is possible but careful analysis is to be carried out to ensure that the energy saved by using smaller bit streams is not outweighed by the computation needed to decompress the data however , there have also been implementations where the reconfigurable fabric is much closer to the processor , some are even implemented into the data path , utilising the processor registers the job of the host processor is to perform the control functions , configure the logic , schedule data and to provide external interfacing one of the major tasks of an operating system is to hide the hardware and present programs ( and their programmers ) with nice , clean , elegant , and consistent abstractions to work with instead a process is a running application that has the perception ( provided by the os ) that it is running on its own on the underlying virtual hardware in addition to abstraction , resource management of the underlying hardware components is necessary because the virtual computers provided to the processes and threads by the operating system need to share available physical resources ( processors , memory , and devices ) spatially and temporarily
