in 1948 , jackson published her debut novel , the road through the wall , which tells a semi-autobiographical account of her childhood growing up in burlingame , california , in the 1920s jackson 's most famous story , '' the lottery '' , first published in the new yorker on june & nbsp ; 26 , 1948 , established her reputation as a master of the horror tale '' the story prompted over 300 letters from readers , many of them outraged at its conjuring of a dark aspect of human nature , characterized by , as jackson put it , '' bewilderment , speculation , and old-fashioned abuse '' in the july 22 , 1948 , issue of the san francisco chronicle , jackson offered the following in response to persistent queries from her readers about her intentions : '' explaining just what i had hoped the story to say is very difficult the event also served as inspiration for her short story '' the missing girl '' ( first published in the magazine of fantasy and science fiction in 1957 , and posthumously in just an ordinary day ( 1995 ) ) the following year , she published life among the savages , a semi-autobiographical collection of short stories based on her own life with her four children , many of which had been published prior in popular magazines such as good housekeeping , woman 's day and collier's semi-fictionalized versions of her marriage and the experience of bringing up four children , these works are '' true-to-life funny-housewife stories '' of the type later popularized by such writers as jean kerr and erma bombeck during the 1950s and 1960s the novel , which interpolated supernatural phenomena with psychology , went on to become a critically esteemed example of the haunted house story , and was described by stephen king as one of the most important horror novels of the twentieth century near the end of her life , jackson also saw a psychiatrist for severe anxiety , which had kept her housebound for extended periods of time , a problem worsened by a diagnosis of colitis , which made it physically difficult to travel even short distances from her home the psychological aspects of her illness responded well to therapy , and by 1964 she began to resume normal activities , including a round of speaking engagements at writers ' conferences , as well as planning a new novel titled come along with me , which was to be a major departure from the style and subject matter of her previous works in 1968 , jackson 's husband released a posthumous volume of her work , come along with me , containing her unfinished last novel , as well as 14 previously uncollected short stories ( among them '' louisa , please come home '' ) and three lectures she gave at colleges or writers ' conferences in her last years henry award 1949 : '' the lottery '' 1951 –

home of north bennington has honored her legacy by celebrating shirley jackson day on june 27 , the day the fictional story '' the lottery '' took place in a march & nbsp ; 4 , 2009 , podcast distributed by the business publisher the economist , showalter also noted that joyce carol oates had edited a collection of jackson 's work called shirley jackson novels and stories that was published in the library of america series '' jackson 's husband wrote in his preface to a posthumous anthology of her work that '' she consistently refused to be interviewed , to explain or promote her work in any fashion , or to take public stands and be the pundit of the sunday magazine hyman insisted that the dark visions found in jackson 's work were not , as some critics claimed , the product of '' personal , even neurotic , fantasies '' , but , rather , comprised '' a sensitive and faithful anatomy '' of the cold war era in which she lived , '' fitting symbols for a distressing world of the concentration camp and the bomb '' jackson may even have taken pleasure in the subversive impact of her work , as indicated by hyman 's statement that she '' was always proud that the union of south africa banned 'the lottery ' , and she felt that they at least understood the story '' in 2009 , critic harold bloom published an extensive study of jackson 's work , challenging the notion that it was worthy of inclusion in the western canon ; bloom wrote of '' the lottery '' , specifically : '' her art of narration stays on the surface , and could not depict individual identities the road through the wall ( farrar , straus , 1948 ) hangsaman ( farrar , straus and young , 1951 ) the bird 's nest ( farrar , straus and young , 1954 ) the sundial ( farrar , straus and
