the traditional explanation of the crosier 's form is that , as a shepherd 's staff , it includes a hook at one end to pull back to the flock any straying sheep , a pointed finial at the other tip to goad the reluctant and the lazy , and a rod in between as a strong support the other has a top composed of a pair of sculptured serpents or dragons with their heads curled back to face each other , with a small cross between them , representing the bishop 's diligence in guarding his flock the sudarium or crosier mantle is still used in the eastern churches , where it is usually made of a rich fabric such as brocade or velvet , and is usually embroidered with a cross or other religious symbol , trimmed with galoon around the edges and fringed at the bottom in the roman catholic church , the crosier is always carried by the bishop with the crook turned away from himself ; that is to say , facing toward the persons or objects he is facing , regardless of whether he is the ordinary or not the other has a top comprising a pair of sculptured serpents or dragons curled back to face each other , with a small cross between them the traditional explanation for the form of western crosiers , beyond the obvious reference to the bishop as a shepherd to his flock , is this : the pointed ferrule at the base symbolizes the obligation of the prelate to goad the spiritually lazy ; the crook at the top , his obligation to draw back those who stray from the faith ; and the staff itself , his obligation to stand as a firm support for the faithful in the western church the usual form has been a shepherd 's crook , curved at the top to enable animals to be hooked the catholic caeremoniale episcoporum caeremoniale episcoporum ( vatican polyglott press , 1985 ) , 59 says that , as a sign of his pastoral function , a bishop uses a crosier within his territory , but any bishop celebrating the liturgy solemnly with the consent of the local bishop may also use it it also states that a bishop usually holds the crosier during a procession and when listening to the reading of the gospel , giving a homily , accepting vows , solemn promises or a profession of faith , and when blessing people , unless he must lay his hands on them , the curved top portion ) may be formed as a simple shepherd 's crook , terminating in a floral pattern , reminiscent of the aaron 's rod , or in a serpent 's head in western christianity , the crosier ( known as the pastoral staff , from the latin pastor , shepherd ) is shaped like a shepherd 's crook a bishop or church head bears this staff as '' shepherd of the flock of god '' , particularly the community under his canonical jurisdiction , but any bishop , whether or not assigned to a functional diocese , may also use a crosier when conferring sacraments and presiding at liturgy in the church of god in christ , incorporated & mdash ; the largest pentecostal christian church in the united states & mdash ; the presiding bishop bears a crosier as a sign of his role as positional and functional leader of the church when the bishop is not holding the crosier , it is put in the care of an altar server , known as the '' crosier bearer '' , who may wear around his shoulders a shawl-like veil called a vimpa , so as to hold the crosier without touching it with his bare hands in the middle ages , much as bishops carried a crosier , popes carried a papal cross with three bars , one more than the two bars found on crosiers carried before archbishops in processions ( see archiepiscopal cross ) in previous times , a cloth of linen or richer material , called the sudarium ( literally , '' sweat cloth '' ) , was suspended from the crosier at the place where the bishop would grasp it 1768 , national museum in warsaw the crosier is the symbol of the governing office of a bishop or apostle it was suppressed in most personal arms in the catholic church in 1969 , and is since found on arms of abbots and abbesses , diocesan coats of arms and other corporate arms
