charles xii had led swedish forces to early victories in north zealand ( summer 1700 ) and in the battle of narva in november 1700 at the time the russians had been occupied with a large rebellion of don cossacks , known as the '' bulavin rebellion '' ( 1707–08 ) in july the swedes defeated marshal boris sheremetyev 's forces at the battle of holowczyn and advanced to the dnieper river , 2000 , the northern wars , 1558–1721 , harlow : pearson education limited , lewenhaupt followed south and was attacked while crossing a river near a small village that gave name to the battle of lesnaya , losing the supply train and half of his force in addition , charles ' last hope of reinforcement expired , as the swedish forces under von krassow had turned aside to deal with the anti-swedish sandomierz confederation in poland , peter , in addition , ordered four more redoubts built so the entire system of ten forts would have a t shape , providing flanking fire to a swedish advance two of the redoubts were still being constructed on the morning of the battle , but 4,000 russians manned the remaining eight , with 10,000 cavalry under gen four columns of infantry and six columns of cavalry were to form during the night , 600 meters south of the redoubts , intending to attack before dawn in order to swiftly bypass the redoubt system and hit the russian fort having lost the element of surprise , and without sufficient cannon to breach the fortifications , rehnskiöld consulted with charles , carl piper and lewenhaupt on whether or not to proceed with the assault by the time rehnskiöld decided to proceed with the attack by quoting , '' in the name of god then , let us go forward '' , it was nearly 4:00 & nbsp ; a.m lewenhaupt 's ten battalions on the right bypassed the first four redoubts entirely , advancing to the back line and , with the aid of cavalry , took some redoubts while bypassing others when the left and right wings of the swedish army made it past the back line of redoubts , sending the russian cavalry in retreat there they awaited roos ' battalions for two hours , while the russian cavalry and ivan skoropadsky 's cossacks waited to the north , with 13 russian battalions deployed north of their camp and ten to the south , anticipating a swedish advance according to charles and reports from other swedish officers , the weather at that time was already very hot and humid , with the sun obscured by smoke from the russian cannon in the fort rehnskiöld ordered lewenhaupt and the swedish line to move forward , advancing towards the russian line , which started firing its cannon at 500 meters advancing to within 30 meters of the russian line , the swedes fired a volley of their own and charged with their muskets and pikesmen , and the russian first line retreated towards their second line as the swedish right flank was still advancing , a gap began to open in the swedish line which the russians filled and the battle turned into a cannae variation barely able to gather his cavalry squadrons , creutz tried to advance on the right flank , but the russian battalions were able to form into hollow squares , while menshikov 's cavalry outflanked the swedes and attacked them from the rear realizing they were the last swedes on the battlefield , charles ordered a retreat to the woods , gathering what remaining forces he could for protection , including the remnants of creutz 's detachment emerging from the woods at around noon , charles—on horseback after his litter was destroyed and protected by a square of a couple of thousand men—headed to pushkaryovka and his baggage train 5 & nbsp ; km to the south , reaching it after 1:00 & nbsp ; p.m lewenhaupt led the surviving swedes and some of the cossack forces to the dnieper river , but was doggedly pursued by the russian regular cavalry and 3,000 kalmyk auxiliaries and forced to surrender at perevolochna , on 1 july voltaire assumed peter 's reason for this , in raising a toast to the swedish generals as war masters , was to send a message to his own generals about disloyalty the high vizier of the turks was eventually paid off , with much intrigue and espionage involved and plots within plots , at one point involving a ransom of the russian crown jewels , according to charles ' prison translator sequel to poltava : diplomacy to contain russia 1709–1714 by bertil haggman battle of poltava on the encyclopedia of ukraine russian order at battle swedish order at battle voltaire 's history of charles xii king of sweden by voltaire
