hume claims intuition is a recognition of relationships ( relation of time , place , and causation ) while he states that '' the resemblance '' ( recognition of relations ) '' will strike the eye '' ( which would not require further examination ) but goes on to state , '' or rather in mind '' —attributing intuition to power of mind , contradicting the theory of empiricism buddhism finds intuition to be a faculty in the mind of immediate knowledge and puts the term intuition beyond the mental process of conscious thinking , as the conscious thought can not necessarily access subconscious information , or render such information into a communicable form an introverted intuitive type orients by images from the unconscious , ever exploring the psychic world of the archetypes , seeking to perceive the meaning of events , but often having no interest in playing a role in those events and not seeing any connection between the contents of the psychic world and him- or herself jung defined intuition as '' perception via the unconscious '' : using sense-perception only as a starting point , to bring forth ideas , images , possibilities , ways out of a blocked situation , by a process that is mostly unconscious in carl jung 's theory of the ego , described in 1916 in psychological types , intuition is an '' irrational function '' , opposed most directly by sensation , and opposed less strongly by the '' rational functions '' of thinking and feeling for sri aurobindo intuition comes under the realms of knowledge by identity ; he describes the psychological plane in humans ( often referred to as mana in sanskrit ) having two arbitrary natures , the first being imprinting of psychological experiences which is constructed through sensory information ( mind seeking to become aware of external world ) it is characterized by rejecting the law of excluded middle : as a consequence it does not in general accept rules such as double negation elimination and the use of reductio ad absurdum to prove the existence of something he finds when self-awareness in the mind is applied to one 's self and the outer ( other ) -self , results in luminous self-manifesting identity ; the reason also converts itself into the form of the self-luminous intuitional knowledge an extraverted intuitive type , '' the natural champion of all minorities with a future '' , orients to new and promising but unproven possibilities , often leaving to chase after a new possibility before old ventures have borne fruit , oblivious to his or her own welfare in the constant pursuit of change in his works meno and phaedo , he describes intuition as a pre-existing knowledge residing in the '' soul of eternity '' , and a phenomenon by which one becomes conscious of pre-existing knowledge also influenced by platonic ideas , ibn sīnā ( avicenna ) finds the ability of having intuition as a '' prophetic capacity '' and describes it as knowledge obtained without intentionally acquiring it siháb al din-al suhrawadi , in his book philosophy of illumination ( ishraq ) , from following influences of plato he finds that intuition is knowledge acquired through illumination , is mystical in nature , and also suggests mystical contemplation ( mushahada ) to bring about correct judgment in islam there are various scholars with varied interpretations of intuition ( often termed as hadas ( arabic : حدس ) , hitting correctly on a mark ) , sometimes relating the ability of having intuitive knowledge to prophethood according to sigmund freud , knowledge could only be attained through the intellectual manipulation of carefully made observations and rejected any other means of acquiring knowledge such as intuition , and his findings could have been an analytic turn of his mind towards the subject according to the works of daniel kahneman , intuition is the ability to automatically generate solutions without long logical arguments or evidence one of the main problems adduced by experimental philosophers is that intuitions differ , for instance , from one culture to another , and so it seems problematic to cite them as evidence for a philosophical claim in the west , intuition does not appear as a separate field of study , but the topic features prominently in the works of many philosophers jung said that a person in whom intuition is dominant , an '' intuitive type '' , acts not on the basis of rational judgment but on sheer intensity of perception williamson , timothy ( 2008 ) '' the philosophy of philosophy '' others like ernest sosa seek to support intuition by arguing that the objections against intuition merely highlight a verbal disagreement in the east intuition is mostly intertwined with religion and spirituality , and various meanings exist from different religious texts ramsey ( eds ) rethinking intuition : the psychology of intuition and its role in philosophical inquiry 1998 , pp
