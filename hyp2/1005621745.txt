a player who was in an offside position at the moment the ball was last touched or played by a team-mate must then become involved in active play , in the opinion of the referee , in order for an offence to occur like fouls , however , any play ( such as the scoring of a goal ) that occurs after an offence has taken place , but before the referee is able to stop the play , is nullified the only time an offence related to offside is cautionable is if a defender deliberately leaves the field in order to deceive their opponents regarding a player 's offside position , or if a forward , having left the field , returns and gains an advantage thumb image : offsideballline.svg thumb 300px right the blue forward in the penalty area of the diagram is not in an offside position , as they are behind the ball , despite the fact that they are closer to the opponents ' goal line than the second-last opponent a player is in an '' offside position '' if they are in the opposing team 's half of the field and also '' nearer to the opponents ' goal line than both the ball and the second-last opponent '' the 2005 edition of the laws of the game included a new ifab decision that stated , '' in the definition of offside position , 'nearer to his opponents ' goal line ' means that any part of their head , body or feet is nearer to their opponents ' goal line than both the ball and the second last opponent by 2017 , the wording had changed to say that , in judging offside position , '' the hands and arms of all players , including the goalkeepers , are not considered '' in other words , a player is in an offside position if two conditions are met : any part of the player 's head , body or feet is in the opponents ' half of the field ( excluding the half-way line ) any part of the player 's head , body or feet is closer to the opponents ' goal line than both the ball and the second-last opponent a player in an offside position at the moment the ball is touched or played by a team-mate is only penalised for committing an offside offence if , in the opinion of the referee , they become involved in active play by : ; interfering with play : '' playing or touching the ball passed or touched by a team-mate '' ; interfering with an opponent : '' preventing an opponent from playing or being able to play the ball by clearly obstructing the opponent ’ s line of vision or : challenging an opponent for the ball or : clearly attempting to play a ball which is close to them when this action impacts on an opponent or : making an obvious action which clearly impacts on the ability of an opponent to play the ball '' ; gaining an advantage by playing the ball or interfering with an opponent when it has : '' - rebounded or been deflected off the goalpost , crossbar , match official or an opponent : - been deliberately saved by any opponent '' in addition to the above criteria , in the 2017–18 edition of the laws of the game , the ifab made a further clarification that , '' in situations where a player moving from , or standing in , an offside position is in the way of an opponent and interferes with the movement of the opponent towards the ball this is an offside offence if it impacts on the ability of the opponent to play or challenge for the ball in this context , according to the ifab , '' a ‘ save ’ is when a player stops , or attempts to stop , a ball which is going into or very close to the goal with any part of the body except the hands/arms ( unless the goalkeeper within the penalty area ) since offside is judged at the time the ball is touched or played by a team-mate , not when the player receives the ball , it is possible for a player to receive the ball significantly past the second-to-last opponent , or even the last opponent , without committing an offence in an effort to avoid such criticisms , which were based on the fact that phrases such as '' interfering with play '' , '' interfering with an opponent '' , and '' gaining an advantage '' were not clearly defined , fifa issued new guidelines for interpreting the offside law in 2003 ; and these were incorporated into law 11 in july 2005 the sanction for an offside offence is an indirect free kick for the opponent at the place where the offence occurred , even if it is in the player 's own half of the field of play in enforcing this rule , the referee depends greatly on an assistant referee , who generally keeps in line with the second-to-last opponent , the ball , or the halfway line , whichever is closer to the goal line of their relevant end an assistant referee signals for an offside offence by first raising their flag to a vertical position and then , if the referee stops play , by partly lowering their flag to an angle that signifies the location of the offence : flag pointed at a 45-degree angle downwards : offence has occurred in the third of the pitch nearest to the assistant referee ; flag parallel to the ground : offence has occurred in the middle third of the pitch ; flag pointed at a 45-degree angle upwards : offence has occurred in the third of the pitch furthest from the assistant referee the assistant referees ' task with regard to offside can be difficult , as they need to keep up with attacks and counter-attacks , consider which players are in an offside position when the ball is played , and then determine whether and when the offside-positioned players become involved in active play the risk of false judgement is further increased by the foreshortening effect , which occurs when the distance between the attacking player and the assistant referee is significantly different from the distance to the defending player , and the assistant referee is not directly in line with the defender trying to judge if a player is level with an opponent at the moment the ball is kicked is not easy : if an attacker and a defender are running in opposite directions , they can be two metres apart in less than a second an 1832 article discussing the eton wall game complained of '' the interminable multiplicity of rules about sneaking , picking up , throwing , rolling , in straight , with a vast number more '' , using the term '' sneaking '' to refer to eton 's offside law the novel tom brown 's school days , published in 1857 but based on the author 's experiences at rugby school from 1834 to 1842 , discussed that school 's offside law : emphasis added the first published set of laws of any code of football ( rugby school , 1845 ) , stated that '' a player is off his side if the ball has touched one of his own side behind him , until the other side touch it ( this is similar to the current offside law in rugby , under which any player between the ball and the opponent 's goal who takes part in play , is liable to be penalised ) in the 1847 laws of the eton field game , as player could not be considered '' sneaking '' if there were four or more opponents between him and the opponents ' goal line he criticized most existing offside laws for being too lax : the rugby laws , for example , were at fault because they permitted an offside player to rejoin play immediately after an opponent touched the ball , while eton 's rule of four allowed '' an immense amount of sneaking '' when the number of players was unlimited thring expressed his views through correspondence in the sporting newspapers such as the field , and through the publication in 1862 of a proposed set of laws known as the simplest game , including a strict offside law which required a player in an offside position ( '' out of play '' , in thring 's terminology ) to '' return behind the ball as soon as possible '' that meeting was , however , disrupted by a dispute over the subject of '' hacking '' ( allowing players to carry the ball , provided they could be kicked in the shins by opponents when doing so , in the manner of rugby school ) at the first revision of the fa laws , in february 1866 , an important qualifier was added to soften the '' strict '' offside law : at the fa 's meeting , the alteration '' gave rise to a lengthy discussion , many thinking with mr over the next seven years , there were several attempts to change the three-player rule , but none were successful : in 1867 , barnes fc proposed that the offside rule should be removed altogether , arguing that '' a player did not stop to count whether there were three of his opponents between him and their own goal '' when an attacking team adopted the so-called '' one back '' game , in which only the goalkeeper and one outfield player remained in defensive positions , it was even possible for players to be caught offside in their own penalty area in 2005 , ifab clarified that , when evaluating an attacking player 's position for the purposes of the offside law , the part of the player 's head , body or feet closest to the defending team 's goal-line should be considered , with the hands and arms being excluded because '' there is no advantage to be gained if only the arms are in advance of the opponent '' in 2009 , it was stated that a defender who leaves the field of play without the referee 's permission must be considered to be on the nearest boundary line for the purposes of deciding whether an attacker is in an offside position in 2016 , it was clarified that a player on the halfway line itself can not be in an offside position : part of the player 's head , body or feet must be within the opponent 's half of the field of play ( according to the '' strict '' offside law used in 1863 , every player on the attacking side would automatically have been in an offside position from such a goalkick , since it had to be taken from the goal line ) under the original laws of 1863 , it was not possible to be offside from a throw-in ; however , since the ball was required to be thrown in at right-angles to the touch-line , it would have been unusual for a player to gain significant advantage from being ahead of the ball now that changes to the interpretations of '' interfering with play , interfering with an opponent and gaining an advantage '' mean a player is not guilty of an offside offence unless they become directly and clearly involved in active play , players not involved in active play can not be '' caught offside '' , making the tactic riskier
