the chevaline solution was to decrease the number of warheads carried by the polaris system from three to two , using the space and weight to carry numerous decoys , and increase the likelihood of warhead survival by substituting a new super-hardened thermonuclear primary for the warhead contained in a new super-hardened rv the project was carried out in extreme secrecy by a team consisting of the atomic weapons establishment ( awe ) at aldermaston , the royal aircraft establishment ( rae ) at farnborough , and hunting engineering at ampthill , sperry gyroscope at bracknell , lockheed aerospace in the united states , and others , both in the us and the uk the system was not a mirving system because the target of both warheads was one location , about which the two warheads were spread , as in the earlier mrv system of polaris a3t the origins of the chevaline requirement grew from the conclusion of several british governments that in the event of a soviet nuclear attack on the uk alone , as had been threatened in late 1950s by soviet premier nikita khrushchev and prime minister nikolai bulganin a.j.r.groom , '' british thinking about nuclear weapons '' , frances pinter , 1974 , pp there were also numerous weapon effects tests to prove the rv/warhead resistance to the radiation-effects of the galosh warhead ; and there were numerous missile tests at the woomera missile range , australia , to develop various aspects of the rvs , the pac and decoys having already put some effort into the skybolt warhead , it was decided to adapt this design , based on the thermonuclear secondary of the us w59 , matched to a primary trigger based on a wholly uk design developed from the cleo device tested at the pampas ugt instead of the w58 used on us navy missiles whilst the fully assembled chevaline reb and a new warhead was of identical external shape , and balance to us polaris rvs to minimise development costs and avoid the need for full-scale flight testing , the chevaline reb was unusual in using a new material known as 3-dimensional quartz phenolic ( 3dqp ) , public record office , london if the polaris fleet was forced to operate to the north of the line , or even within a limited distance of it , they would be lacking the protection of the bulk of the nato forces , and potentially in the midst of a high concentration of enemy hunter-killer subs given that these items would be expensive , the abm interceptor itself was likely to cost about the same as an icbm ( or less ) , so any increase in the enemy 's stockpile could be countered for an additional expenditure of about the same amount efforts were made to reduce warhead weight by substituting a new , smaller , high-yielding thermonuclear primary tested at fondutta ugt and quargel ugt , and although these tests were deemed successful , the delays involved in preparing them for chevaline were thought to risk further unacceptable delays to the in-service date planned , and they were not used in the end , the alternatives were '' between chevaline or nothing at all ; a decision which could easily have meant withdrawal of the uk from the military political nuclear scene '' and that option was unthinkable to the military staffs and government alike this would require a much faster-reacting radar and computer system than an abm using a long-range interceptor , one that could safely wait until only a few moments before detonation , but this was by no means impossible and was part of the us 's own abm systems the first production examples of the chevaline reb were manufactured by avco , now part of textron textron website before production began in the uk at the royal ordnance factory at burghfield , now incorporated into the atomic weapons establishment , using quartz thread material obtained from france some related options were explored , including '' option m '' which used a simple '' de-mirved '' bus , '' hybrid '' ( or '' stag '' ) which put the newer poseidon warheads on the existing polaris a3t missiles , and '' mini poseidon '' , a similar adaptation with a smaller six-poseidon-warhead payload on the a3t the us later decided to move primary development from the c4 to the larger trident d5 , a much more capable missile , but one that would not fit into the latest s , let alone the older this system provided marginal capability and a number of projected developments were considered as blue steel ii , which increased both its range to improve the survivability of the bomber and speed to improve the survivability of the missile although in theory the uk might be able to use the us-designed bus , these options were being explored in the midst of the abm treaty , and it was not clear whether the treaty might forbid this technology being transferred a licence to manufacture 3dqp in the us was acquired and production was undertaken by avco , one of the two suppliers of us rv 's , the other being general electric the us bomber force was facing the same sorts of problems as the british v bombers , and were attempting to solve it in a similar fashion , with a long-range standoff missile the system was tested at the us eastern test range , cape canaveral , and the warheads were tested with two full scale underground nuclear tests – 'ugt 's – ( fallon ugt in 1974 and banon ugt in 1976 ) at the nevada test site an american response was to develop '' antelope '' , a system designed to overwhelm an abm defence with decoys , or penaids ( penetration aids ) this system was in service from 1982 to 1996 , when it was replaced by trident d5 although the polaris was fairly immune to direct attack in the submerged ballistic missile submarines , this meant little if the warheads could not make it through the soviet defences & ndash ; especially if the soviets were convinced of this the royal navy preferred to upgrade to the ugm-73 poseidon , increasing the number of warheads from three per missile to between ten and thirteen of a newer and lighter design prompted by a request for a name-change from his boss , the secretary of state for defence , lord carrington , the official asked the zoo to 'imagine an animal like a large antelope ' and inquired whether there was such a beast with chevaline , the patrol area was limited to the north of and just around the giuk gap , whereas previously they could operate within an area to the south of the gap as well one key part of the agreement was that the uk would develop their own warheads for the missiles , as the uk military and political establishments were rather worried about losing their own nuclear production and design capability the pac dispensed one rv but the principal purpose of its manoeuvring capability was to dispense the 27 decoys into a 'threat tube ' surrounding the rvs , which also had a 'disguise ' to match their radar appearance to the decoys a single with 16 missiles would throw a total of 48 warheads , making it conceivable that many of them might be destroyed by even a small number of abms the response to the threat of interception by abm-1 galosh missiles was to deploy an upgraded or improved front end ( ife ) to polaris a3t using the antelope/super antelope/chevaline technology
