morley eventually received a two-year jail term , and fadden was promoted in his place , again defeating more than 50 other applicants ; he was reputedly the '' youngest town clerk in australia '' in 1918 , fadden served on the committee of the relief fund for the mackay cyclone , which devastated the town and killed thirty people however , he resigned as town clerk in september of that year and moved to townsville ( the largest settlement in north queensland ) , where he established his own accountancy firm at the 1932 state election , fadden was elected to the queensland legislative assembly as a member of the country and progressive national party ( cpnp ) he was the only candidate from his party to win a seat from labor , which won majority government on a swing of almost 10 points in early 1936 , he joined the queensland country party , which had split from the cpnp in order to align with the federal country party cribb ( 1988 ) later that year , he was elected to the house of representatives at a by-election for the division of darling downs it was caused by the death of the previous member , littleton groom , who was a member of the united australia party ( uap ) fadden , who had no previous connection with the area , was the first member of his party to contest the seat ; the uap suffered a negative swing of over 40 points when robert menzies was elected by the united australia party ( uap ) as lyons ' replacement , page gave a speech accusing menzies of disloyalty and questioning his record of military service as a result of page 's attacks , which they deemed unfair , fadden and bernard corser resigned from the parliamentary country party to sit as '' independent country '' members ; they were soon followed by oliver badman and thomas collins when asked in another debate if he were still a member of the country party , he replied '' no , i am not , thank goodness , as it is now constituted and under its present leadership '' in march 1940 , menzies and cameron agreed to resume the coalition , providing an opportunity for five country party members to be added to the ministry cameron somewhat unexpectedly nominated fadden as a country party representative , and he was appointed as an assistant minister to the treasurer ( percy spender ) and the minister for supply ( australia ) ( frederick stewart ) in august 1940 , fadden narrowly escaped being killed in the canberra air disaster , which claimed the lives of three government ministers and the chief of the general staff after the crash , fadden replaced fairbairn as minister for air and minister for civil aviation ; he also continued as assistant minister to the treasurer the country party lost three seats to the labor party , and on 16 october the parliamentary party voted to remove archie cameron as leader during a break for dinner , fadden was asked to become interim leader as a compromise between the two candidates , with the intention that another leadership election would be held in a few months according to his biographer tracey arklay , '' fadden was selected because the majority in the party room considered that he was the man most likely to be able to broker deals and negotiate with menzies and the uap '' as the acting leader of his party , fadden became the de facto deputy prime minister and joined the advisory war council although the non-labor coalition had been in power for a decade , the uap was so bereft of leadership that on 28 august a joint uap-country meeting chose fadden as coalition leader even though the country party was the smaller of the two non-labor parties he was the only member of the country/national party to serve as prime minister without an expectation of a short tenure ( the other two country/national prime ministers , page and mcewen , served as caretakers ) it was later reported that fadden decided against moving into the lodge , the official prime minister 's residence in canberra , after his predecessor as country party leader , cameron , crudely told him that he would '' scarcely have enough time to wear a track from the backdoor to the shithouse before you â€™ ll be out '' on 3 october , the two independents who had been keeping the coalition in office for the last year , coles and wilson , voted against fadden 's budget the governor-general was reluctant to call an election for a house that was barely a year old , especially considering that the war had recently been brought to the nation 's doorstep with japan 's advances following the fall of his ministry , a joint uap-country party meeting endorsed fadden as leader of the opposition , even though the uap was nominally the senior coalition partner even allowing for curtin 's personal popularity , as well as the significant advantages which an incumbent government in a westminster system has in wartime , fadden proved a disappointment as leader of the opposition ; he was unable to get the better of curtin there was some speculation that the country party would be included in the merger ( as had already happened in several states ) , but fadden was keen to assert the independence of his party indeed , in the lead up to the 1949 election , fadden often made inflammatory claims about the '' socialist '' nature of the labor party which menzies could then '' clarify '' or repudiate as he saw fit , thus appearing more '' moderate '' the coalition won a massive victory in the 1949 election , and fadden , who transferred to the newly created seat of mcpherson on the gold coast , became treasurer in the second menzies government fadden resigned as leader of the country party on 26 march 1958 , with john mcewen elected unopposed as his successor although the election was held on 22 november , he did not resign from the ministry until 9 december , remaining in office as treasurer for over two weeks while not being a member of parliament having continued as treasurer after his resignation as country party leader it was unusual that the treasurer was a member of the junior party of the coalition who was not also the current party leader fadden and fellow country party leader earle page are the only country party members to have been treasurers in non-labor coalition governments and fadden is the only non-liberal treasurer in a liberal-led coalition government reviewing the book for the canberra times , don aitkin observed that fadden had '' the reputation of a political buffoon , a man of earthy wit and hail-fellow-well-metness who survived in politics because he knew more and better stories than the next man fadden was appointed to the privy council in 1942 , granted him the style '' right honourable '' , and was made a knight commander of the order of st michael and st george ( kcmg ) in 1951 it 's an honour - fadden kcmg he was knighted in person by king george vi in london on 31 january 1952 , only a week before the king 's death , and formally sworn of the privy council the following day after fadden 's death , the canberra suburb of fadden and the federal electoral division of fadden were named in his honour , as is traditional for australian prime ministers
