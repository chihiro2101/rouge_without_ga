this sparked a month-long war in the diet over whether or not to censure tanaka ; eventually , prime minister nakasone , himself elected by tanaka 's faction , dissolved the diet and called for a new election , stating that '' in view of the current unusual parliamentary situation , there is a need for refreshing the people 's minds as quickly as possible this technique was used to some success by two prominent politicians decades later : junichiro koizumi , who recruited a large number of new ldp representatives dubbed '' koizumi children '' in the 2005 election , and ichiro ozawa , who did the same for the democratic party of japan in the 2009 election public chiding of tanaka continued during 1985 , including sega 's i 'm sorry ( video game ) titled featuring a caricature of tanaka dodging various celebrities in a quest to collect gold bars and grow wealthy , with the title punning on the japanese term for '' prime minister '' , sōri ( 総理 ) the faction raised much less in donations during the 1990s and 2000s than it did under tanaka and takeshita in the 1980s , as electoral reforms enacted in 1994 , coupled with new campaign finance regulations and the ongoing economic slump that followed the japanese asset price bubble , weakened the power of factions in japanese politics the remnants of the faction , formally known by this time as heisei kenkyūkai ( heisei research council ) , remained active under the leadership of yūji tsushima , who resigned prior to the 2009 general election , passing control to fukushiro nukaga however , neither the '' koizumi children '' nor the '' ozawa children '' showed the same degree of loyalty as the tanaka faction , with many '' koizumi children '' voting against koizumi 's reform agenda , and many '' ozawa children '' voting against ozawa in his 2010 bid for the dpj presidency tanaka 's government expanded the welfare state through measures such as the doubling of national pension benefits , the introduction of free medical care for the elderly , the provision of child allowances in 1972 , and the indexation of pensions to the rate of inflation in 1973 the announcement ended his 42-year career in politics ; the remnants of his faction , now led by former prime minister takeshita , remained the most powerful bloc within the ldp at the time of his retirement susumu nikaido , the titular chairman of tanaka 's faction , mounted a campaign against takeshita to attempt to win over members of tanaka 's faction amid uncertainty as to his condition , which was only known to tanaka 's family and doctors when satō became prime minister in 1965 , tanaka was slated to become the ldp 's new secretary general , but the emergence of the eisaku satō , where tanaka was accused of shady land deals in tokyo , meant that takeo fukuda got the job instead the drafting office only kept tanaka busy for two years : he was drafted into the army in 1939 and sent to manchuria , where he served as an enlisted clerk in the morioka cavalry , reaching the rank of superior private ( jōtōhei ) in march 1940 on new year 's day of 1987 , he made his first public appearance since the stroke , and was clearly in poor condition : half of his face was paralyzed , and he was grossly overweight in 1946 , he moved from tokyo to niigata to prepare his first bid for a diet seat : he worked around the election laws of the time by buying buildings throughout the district and placing large '' tanaka '' signs on them he already carried great influence in the ldp , despite his lack of seniority : this was partly because of his friendship with future prime minister eisaku satō , and partly because his stepdaughter had married future prime minister hayato ikeda 's nephew , giving him a personal relationship with both key heads of the party on 6 february 1976 , the vice chairman of the lockheed corporation told a united states senate subcommittee that tanaka had accepted 1.8 & nbsp ; million in bribes through the trading company marubeni during his term as prime minister , in return for having all nippon airways purchase 21 lockheed l-1011 aircraft in 1972 many tanaka supporters viewed the scandal as an effort by american multinational corporations to '' get '' tanaka in response to his hard-line stance in trade talks with the united states , based on the fact that the scandal originated with congressional testimony in the us the article inspired tanaka 's ldp rivals to open a public inquiry in the diet ( among other things , tanaka had purchased a geisha and used her name for a number of shady land deals in tokyo during the mid-sixties ) his faction had 70 to 80 members prior to his arrest in 1976 , but grew to over 150 members by 1981 , more than one-third of the total ldp representation in the diet makiko tanaka , who was not associated with etsuzankai , was elected to her father 's old seat in niigata in the 1993 election and became foreign minister in the koizumi cabinet in 2001 none of his major buildings were damaged in the firebombing of tokyo , and just weeks before the japanese surrender , he travelled to seoul and cashed in ¥15b ( about us 78m ) in japanese war bonds in december 1945 , as the first postwar diet was being planned by the american occupation authorities , tanaka was able to give generous donations to an associate affiliated with the japan moderate progressive party ( nihon shinpoto ) one of tanaka 's most remembered achievements is normalizing japanese relations with the people 's republic of china , which occurred around the same time as richard nixon 's efforts to do the same for chinese relations with the united states his visit to europe was the first visit by a japanese prime minister since 1962 , and his visit to the ussr was the first since 1956 although satō wanted fukuda to become the next prime minister , tanaka 's popularity , along with support from the factions of yasuhiro nakasone and masayoshi ōhira , gave him a 282–190 victory over fukuda in the ldp 's 1971 party president election fukuda and tanaka soon became the two battling heir apparents of satō 's faction , and their rivalry was dubbed by the japanese press as the '' kaku-fuku war after two years in the military , he contracted pneumonia in february 1941 and was returned to tokyo to recover ; he never re-enlisted , leaving the army in october it split in 1992 , after noboru takeshita was sidelined by the recruit scandal , with tsutomu hata and ichiro ozawa leaving the ldp and forming the japan renewal party
