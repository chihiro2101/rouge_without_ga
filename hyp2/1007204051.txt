the band 's roots lie in the hardcore punk scene of the early 1980s , along with a strong influence from the british 2 tone ska scene of the 1970s it was through cheapskates that a core lineup coalesced around barrett , gittleman , tim '' johnny vegas '' burton ( saxophone ) , nate albert ( guitar ) , josh dalsimer ( drums ) , tim bridwell ( trumpet ) and ben carr ( a ubiquitous , dancing non-musician onstage presence , later credited as '' bosstone '' ) while some of the band members were influenced by bands such as ac/dc , social distortion , motörhead , the clash and stiff little fingers , barrett had become enthralled with 2 tone ska , which was in the tail end of its prominence around this time , it was brought to the band 's attention that an a cappella group , the bosstones , had already used the name during the 1950s a bartender friend arbitrarily suggested that they become the '' mighty mighty bosstones '' , in order to avoid any possible legal hassles , to which the band agreed despite not consistently drawing large crowds at their live shows , the taang ! record label gave the band a recording contract which would result in the devil 's night out album , produced by paul q the ep featured the title track as well as cover versions of aerosmith 's '' sweet emotion '' , metallica 's '' enter sandman '' , van halen 's '' ai n't talkin ' 'bout love '' and a new version of '' do somethin ' crazy '' , originally featured on devil 's night out the band would film a video for the song '' where 'd you go ?
