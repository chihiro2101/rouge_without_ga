hudd reasoned that the scholars of the 1507 cosmographiae introductio , unfamiliar with richard ameryk , assumed that the name america , which he claimed had been in use for ten years , was based on amerigo vespucci and , therefore , mistakenly transferred the honour from ameryk to vespucci marcou corresponded with augustus le plongeon , who wrote : '' the name america or amerrique in the mayan language means , a country of perpetually strong wind , or the land of the wind , and an accompanying book , cosmographiae introductio , anonymous but apparently written by waldseemüller 's collaborator matthias ringmann , states , '' i do not see what right any one would have to object to calling this part that is , the south american mainland , after americus who discovered it and who is a man of intelligence , amerigen , that is , the land of americus , or america : since both europa and asia got their names from women '' spain officially refused to accept the name america for two centuries , saying that columbus should get credit , and waldseemüller 's later maps , after ringmann 's death , did not include it ; however , usage was established when gerardus mercator applied the name to the entire new world in his 1538 world map americus vesputius was the latinized version of the italian explorer amerigo vespucci 's name , the forename being an old italianization ( compare modern italian enrico ) of medieval latin ( see saint emeric of hungary ) , from the old high german name emmerich , which may have been a merger of several germanic names – amalric , ermanaric and old high german haimirich , from proto-germanic amala- ( 'vigor , bravery ' ) , ermuna- ( 'great ; whole ' ) or haima- ( 'home ' ) + rīk- ( 'ruler ' ) ( compare haimarīks ) since the 16c , a name of the western hemisphere , often in the plural americas and more or less synonymous with the new world but , as etymologist joy rea has suggested , it could also be read as an explanation , in which he indicates that he has heard the new world was called america , and the only explanation lay in vespucci 's name hudd used a quote from a late 15th-century manuscript ( a calendar of bristol events ) , the original of which had been lost in an 1860 bristol fire , that indicated the name america was already known in bristol in 1497 in modern english , north and south america are generally considered separate continents , and taken together are called the americas in the plural , parallel to similar situations such as the carolinas and the dakotas amerigo vespucci ( march 9 , 1454february 22 , 1512 ) was an italian explorer , financier , navigator and cartographer who first postulated that the west indies and corresponding mainland were not part of asia 's eastern outskirts as initially conjectured from columbus 's voyages , but instead constituted an entirely separate landmass hitherto unknown to the europeans ” in addition , waldseemüller not only is exonerated from the charge of having arrogated to himself the privilege of naming lands , which privilege was reserved to monarchs and actual explorers , but also is freed from the charge of violating the long-established and virtually inviolable ancient european tradition of using only the first name of royal individuals as opposed to the last name of commoners ( such as vespucci ) in bestowing names to lands america is also inscribed on the paris green globe ( or globe vert ) which has been attributed to waldseemüller and dated to 1506–07 : as well as the single name inscribed on the northern and southern parts of the new world , the continent also bears the inscription : america ab inuentore nuncupata ( america , named after its discoverer ) '' the man who inspired america ?
