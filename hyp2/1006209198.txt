more in detail norrland is made up of three north-south belts : the scandinavian mountains in the west , the muddus plains covering much of the inland , and the mixed relief of the eastern coast unlike the much more densely populated svealand and götaland , which are better known for big cities ( stockholm , gothenburg , malmö ) with landmarks and tourist attractions , norrland is known for its nature : wide forests , large rivers and untouched wilderness the largest cities in norrland , from north to south , are luleå , skellefteå , umeå , östersund , sundsvall and gävle to the west it represented the northern half of sweden bounded to the south by svealand and to the east it represented the northern half of finland – which was then a part of sweden – bounded to the south by österland up to the middle ages , the northern part of norrland ( norrbotten and lappland ) was basically a no man 's land while the word finland originally meant only the southwestern part of what is now finland ( finland proper ) , the border of norrland was drawn at the rivers kaakamojoki or , later , simojoki the southern border was originally everything north of the gästrikland province ( until the 14th or 15th century a part of uppland ) , but since the mid 17th century , gästrikland is also considered a part of norrland despite norrland being the most diverse of the three lands of sweden in terms of languages and cultures it is usually portrayed as one homogeneous region the film is notorious for having the actors speak without the district norrland accent , even the actors in the film who are native to norrland a mixed portrait of the region is found in as it is in heaven ( 2004 ) , which '' vividly conveys both the delights and the challenges of small town living a constantly repeated theme in the book 's background are the social , cultural and physical differences between these two locations : norrland is more sedate , conservative and slow-moving in comparison with the cosmopolitan stockholm ; a stockholmer having to live for an extended period in norrland feels '' exiled to the back of beyond '' ; norrland is also colder , and a stockholmer coming there must urgently buy warmer clothes ( a theme highlighted also in as it is in heaven ) ; norrlanders often speak norrland dialects which stockholm people find nearly incomprehensible ; stockholm people look down their noses at '' a working class boy from norrland '' even when he had lived many years in stockholm
