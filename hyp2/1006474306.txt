a social group exhibits some degree of social cohesion and is more than a simple collection or aggregate of individuals , such as people waiting at a bus stop , or people waiting in a line social psychologist muzafer sherif proposed to define a social unit as a number of individuals interacting with each other with respect to : muzafer sherif , and carolyn sherif , an outline of social psychology ( rev roles established status ( social rank , dominance ) relationships accepted norms and values with reference to matters relevant to the group development of accepted sanctions ( praise and punishment ) if and when norms were respected or violated this definition is long and complex , but it is also precise it succeeds in providing the researcher with the tools required to answer three important questions : '' how is a group formed ? '' '' how does a group function ? '' '' how does one describe those social interactions that occur on the way to forming a group ? '' some of the earliest efforts to understand these social units have been the extensive descriptions of urban street gangs in the 1920s and 1930s , continuing through the 1950s , which understood them to be largely reactions to the established authority of course , while this is true , it is equally likely that the study of the social ( group ) behaviors of other animals might shed light on the evolutionary roots of social behavior in people territorial and dominance behaviors in humans are so universal and commonplace that they are simply taken for granted ( though sometimes admired , as in home ownership , or deplored , as in violence ) the psychological internalization of territorial and dominance experiences in conscious and unconscious memory are established through the formation of social identity , personal identity , body concept , or self-concept an adequately functioning individual identity is necessary before an individual can function in a division of labor ( role ) , and hence , within a cohesive group explicitly contrasted against a social cohesion based definition for social groups is the social identity approach , which draws on insights made in social identity theory monterey , ca : brooks/cole here , rather than defining a social group based on expressions of cohesive social relationships between individuals , the social identity model assumes that '' psychological group membership has primarily a perceptual or cognitive basis '' it posits that the necessary and sufficient condition for individuals to act as group members is '' awareness of a common category membership '' and that a social group can be '' usefully conceptualized as a number of individuals who have internalized the same social category membership as a component of their self concept '' stated otherwise , while the social cohesion approach expects group members to ask '' who am i attracted to ? '' , the social identity perspective expects group members to simply ask '' who am i ? '' empirical support for the social identity perspective on groups was initially drawn from work using the minimal group paradigm european journal of social psychology , 2 , 149–78 , also problematic for the social cohesion account is recent research showing that seemingly meaningless categorization can be an antecedent of perceptions of interdependence with fellow category members whereas social identity theory was directed initially at the explanation of intergroup conflict in the absence of any conflict of interests , self-categorization theory was developed to explain how individuals come to perceive themselves as members of a group in the first place , and how this self-grouping process underlies and determines all problems subsequent aspects of group behaviour relationship interactions : “ actions performed by group members that relate to or influence the emotional and interpersonal bonds within the group , including both positive actions ( social support , consideration ) and negative actions ( criticism , conflict ) “ the state of being dependent , to some degree , on other people , as when one ’ s outcomes , actions , thoughts , feelings , and experiences are determined in whole or part by others for example , a sports team would have a relatively high level of interdependence as compared to a group of people watching a movie at the movie theater when people speak of groups , they speak of the group as a whole , or an entity , rather than speaking of it in terms of individuals categories consist of individuals that are similar to one another in a certain way , and members of this group can be permanent ingroup members or temporary ingroup members lower quantity or quality social relationships have been connected to issues such as : development of cardiovascular disease , myocardial infarction , atherosclerosis , autonomic dysregulation , high blood pressure , cancer and delayed cancer recovery , and slower wound healing as well as inflammatory biomarkers and impaired immune function , factors associated with adverse health outcomes and mortality the social relationship of marriage is the most studied of all , the marital history over the course of one 's life can form differing health outcomes such as cardiovascular disease , chronic conditions , mobility limitations , self-rated health , and depressive symptoms it has been shown that being well socially connected has a significant impact on a person as they age , according to a 10-year study by the macarthur foundation , which was published in the book 'successful aging ' the support , love , and care we feel through our social connections can help to counteract some of the health-related negatives of aging ( for more , see minimax , as part of social exchange theory ) once a group has begun to form , it can increase membership through a few ways if the group is an open group , where membership boundaries are relatively permeable , group members can enter and leave the group as they see fit ( often via at least one of the aforementioned principles of attraction ) if a group is highly cohesive , it will likely engage in processes that contribute to cohesion levels , especially when recruiting new members , who can add to a group 's cohesion , or destabilize it in all groups , formal and informal initiations add to a group 's cohesion and strengthens the bond between the individual and group by demonstrating the exclusiveness of group membership as well as the recruit 's dedication to the group social influence identifies 3 stages of conversion : compliance ( individual will comply or accept group 's views , but not necessarily agree with them ) , identification ( member begins to mimic group 's actions , values , characteristics , etc all of this seldom takes place without some conflict or disagreement : for example , fighting over the distribution of resources , the choices of means and different subgoals , the development of what are appropriate norms , rewards and punishments depending on the number of individuals in the original collection of strangers , and the number of '' hangers-on '' that are tolerated , one or more competing groups of ten or less may form , and the competition for territory and dominance will then also be manifested in the inter group transactions there are numerous reasons for stable groups to '' malfunction '' or to disperse , but essentially this is because of loss of compliance with one or more elements of the definition of group provided by sherif the two most common causes of a malfunctioning group are the addition of too many individuals , and the failure of the leader to enforce a common purpose , though malfunctions may occur due to a failure of any of the other elements ( i.e in a society , there is a need for more people to participate in cooperative endeavors than can be accommodated by a few separate groups private companies , corporations , government agencies , clubs , and so on have all developed comparable ( if less formal and standardized ) systems when the number of members or employees exceeds the number that can be accommodated in an effective group the number of functioning members in a group can be reasonably flexible between five and ten , and a long-standing cohesive group may be able to tolerate a few hangers on the key concept is that the value and success of a group is obtained by each member maintaining a distinct , functioning identity in the minds of each of the members often , if a strong common purpose is still present , a simple reorganization with a new leader and a few new members will be sufficient to re-establish the group , which is somewhat easier than forming an entirely new group
