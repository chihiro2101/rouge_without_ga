'' whoever wants eudaimonia must consider these three questions : first , how are pragmata ( ethical matters , affairs , topics ) by nature ? secondly , what attitude should we adopt towards them ? thirdly , what will be the outcome for those who have this attitude ? '' pyrrho 's answer is that '' as for pragmata they are all adiaphora ( undifferentiated by a logical differentia ) , astathmēta ( unstable , unbalanced , not measurable ) , and anepikrita ( unjudged , unfixed , undecidable ) this view is confirmed in the crito , where socrates gets crito to agree that the perfection of the soul , virtue , is the most important good : and is life worth living for us with that part of us corrupted that unjust action harms and just action benefits ? or do we think that part of us , whatever it is , that is concerned with justice and injustice , is inferior to the body ? not at all rather , we should be adoxastoi ( without views ) , aklineis ( uninclined toward this side or that ) , and akradantoi ( unwavering in our refusal to choose ) , saying about every single one that it no more is than it is not or it both is and is not or it neither is nor is not eudaimon : verbally there is a very general agreement ; for both the general run of men and people of superior refinement say that it is eudaimonia , and identify living well and faring well with being happy ; but with regard to what eudaimonia is they differ , and the many do not give the same account as the wise this conception of eudaimonia derives from aristotle 's essentialism understanding of human nature , the view that reason ( logos sometimes translated as rationality ) is unique to human beings and that the ideal function or work ( ergon ) of a human being is the fullest or most perfect exercise of reason definitions , a dictionary of greek philosophical terms attributed to plato himself but believed by modern scholars to have been written by his immediate followers in the academy , provides the following definition of the word eudaimonia : '' the good composed of all goods ; an ability which suffices for living well ; perfection in respect of virtue ; resources sufficient for a living creature but if one says that a system is a way of life that , in accordance with appearances , follows a certain rationale , where that rationale shows how it is possible to seem to live rightly ( '' rightly '' being taken , not as referring only to aretē , but in a more ordinary sense ) and tends to produce the disposition to epoche , then we say that he does have a system in this , they are akin to cynic philosophers such as antisthenes and diogenes in denying the importance to eudaimonia of external goods and circumstances , such as were recognized by aristotle , who thought that severe misfortune ( such as the death of one 's family and friends ) could rob even the most virtuous person of eudaimonia as this would be considered the most positive state to be in , the word is often translated as 'happiness ' although incorporating the divine nature of the word extends the meaning to also include the concepts of being fortunate , or blessed good sir , you are an athenian , a citizen of the greatest city with the greatest reputation for both wisdom and power ; are you not ashamed of your eagerness to possess as much wealth , reputation , and honors as possible , while you do not care for nor give thought to wisdom or truth or the best possible state of your soul '' in his nicomachean ethics ( §21 ; 1095a15–22 ) , aristotle says that everyone agrees that eudaimonia is the highest good for human beings , but that there is substantial disagreement on what sort of life counts as doing and living well ; i.e this thesis—the eudaimon life is the pleasurable life—is not a tautology as '' eudaimonia is the good life '' would be : rather , it is the substantive and controversial claim that a life of pleasure and absence of pain is what eudaimonia consists in one important move in greek philosophy to answer the question of how to achieve eudaimonia is to bring in another important concept in ancient philosophy , aretē ( 'virtue ' ) in terms of its etymology , eudaimonia is an abstract noun derived from the words eu ( 'good , well ' ) and daimōn ( 'spirit ' ) , the latter referring to a minor deity or a guardian spirit '' this answer expresses the point that money is instrumentally valuable because its value lies in what one obtains by means of it – in this case , the money is a means to getting an apartment and a sports car and the value of making this money dependent on the price of these commodities one important difference between epicurus ' eudaimonism and that of plato and aristotle is that for the latter virtue is a constituent of eudaimonia , whereas epicurus makes virtue a means to happiness aristotle says that the eudaimon life is one of '' virtuous activity in accordance with reason '' 1097b22 & ndash ; 1098a20 ; even epicurus , who argues that the eudaimon life is the life of pleasure , maintains that the life of pleasure coincides with the life of virtue plato 's great work of the middle period , the republic , is devoted to answering a challenge made by the sophist thrasymachus , that conventional morality , particularly the 'virtue ' of justice , actually prevents the strong man from achieving eudaimonia with respect to aretē , the pyrrhonist philosopher sextus empiricus said : if one defines a system as an attachment to a number of dogmas that agree with one another and with phantasiai , and defines a dogma as an assent to something non-evident , we shall say that the pyrrhonist does not have a system but if eudaimonia is to be achieved through the satisfaction of desire , whereas being just or acting justly requires suppression of desire , then it is not in the interests of the strong man to act according to the dictates of conventional morality for the former think it is some plain and obvious thing like pleasure , wealth or honour… 1095a17 so , as aristotle points out , saying that eudaimon life is a life which is objectively desirable , and means living well , is not saying very much so it is important to bear in mind that the sense of ‘ virtue ' operative in ancient ethics is not exclusively moral and includes more than states such as wisdom , courage and compassion for example , in the meno , with respect to wisdom , he says : '' everything the soul endeavours or endures under the guidance of wisdom ends in happiness '' ( meno 88c ) anscombe recommends a return to the eudaimonistic ethical theories of the ancients , particularly aristotle , which ground morality in the interests and well-being of human moral agents , and can do so without appealing to any such lawgiver in contrast , plato argues that the unjust man 's soul , without the virtues , is chaotic and at war with itself , so that even if he were able to satisfy most of his desires , his lack of inner harmony and unity thwart any chance he has of achieving eudaimonia socrates is convinced that virtues such as self-control , courage , justice , piety , wisdom and related qualities of mind and soul are absolutely crucial if a person is to lead a good and happy ( eudaimon ) life one problem with the english translation of areté as 'virtue ' is that we are inclined to understand virtue in a moral sense , which is not always what the ancients had in mind ancient ethical theory , stanford encyclopedia of philosophy aristotle 's ethics , stanford encyclopedia of philosophy aristotle : ethics , internet encyclopedia of philosophy one difference is that whereas the stoics regard external goods as neutral , as neither good nor bad , kant 's position seems to be that external goods are good , but only so far as they are a condition to achieving happiness the candidates that he mentions are a ( 1 ) life of pleasure , ( 2 ) a life of political activity , and ( 3 ) a philosophical life ) we saw earlier that the conventional greek concept of arete is not quite the same as that denoted by virtue , which has christian connotations of charity , patience , and uprightness , since arete includes many non-moral virtues such as physical strength and beauty so , a person who is hideously ugly or has '' lost children or good friends through death '' ( 1099b5–6 ) , or who is isolated , is unlikely to be eudaimon epicurus ' basic doctrine is that a life of virtue is the life which generates the most amount of pleasure , and it is for this reason that we ought to be virtuous the japanese concept of ikigai has been described as eudaimonic well-being , as it '' entails actions of devoting oneself to pursuits one enjoys and is associated with feelings of accomplishment and fulfillment julia driver in the stanford encyclopedia of philosophy explains : anscombe 's article modern moral philosophy stimulated the development of virtue ethics as an alternative to utilitarianism , kantian ethics , and social contract theories in outline , for aristotle , eudaimonia involves activity , exhibiting virtue ( aretē sometimes translated as excellence ) in accordance with reason his theory is eudaimonist in that he holds that virtue is indispensable to happiness ; but virtue is not a constituent of a eudaimon life , and being virtuous is not ( external goods aside ) identical with being eudaimon zeno believed happiness was a '' good flow of life '' ; cleanthes suggested it was '' living in agreement with nature '' , and chrysippus believed it was '' living in accordance with experience of what happens by nature ( 31a & ndash ; b ; italics added ) it emerges a bit further on that this concern for one 's soul , that one 's soul might be in the best possible state , amounts to acquiring moral virtue theories include diener 's tripartite model of subjective well-being , ryff 's six-factor model of psychological well-being , keyes work on flourishing , and seligman 's contributions to positive psychology and his theories on authentic happiness and p.e.r.m.a basically , well-being ( eudaimonia ) is gained by proper development of one 's highest and most human capabilities and human beings are '' the rational animal '' in the apology , socrates clearly presents his disagreement with those who think that the eudaimon life is the life of honour or pleasure , when he chastises the athenians for caring more for riches and honour than the state of their souls the rest of the nicomachean ethics is devoted to filling out the claim that the best life for a human being is the life of excellence in accordance with reason
