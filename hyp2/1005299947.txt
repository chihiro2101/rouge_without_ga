the chinese concept of the world was largely a division between the civilized world and the barbarian world and there was little concept of the belief that chinese interests were served by a powerful chinese state commenter lucian pye has argued that the modern '' nation state '' is fundamentally different from a traditional empire , and argues that dynamics of the current people 's republic of china ( prc ) – a concentration of power at a central point of authority – share an essential similarity with the ming and qing empires chinese nationalism was rooted in the long historic tradition of china as the center of the world , in which all other states were offshoots and owed some sort of deference that sense of superiority underwent a series of terrible shocks in the 19th century , including large-scale internal revolts , and more grievously the systematic gaining and removal of special rights and privileges by foreign nations who proved their military superiority during the first and second opium wars , based on modern technology that was lacking in china the most dramatic watershed came in 1900 , in the wake of the invasion , capture , and pillaging of the national capital by an eight-nation coalition that punished china for the boxer rebellion over the first half of the twentieth century , chinese nationalism has constituted a crucial part of many political ideologies , including the anti-manchuism during 1911 revolution , the anti-imperialism sentiment of the may fourth movement in 1919 , and the maoist thoughts that guided the communist revolution in 1949 after the collapse of the qing regime and the founding of the republic of china in 1911 , concerns of both domestic and international threat made the role of racism decline , while anti-imperialism became the new dominant ideology of chinese nationalism over the 1910s after qing 's defeat in the first sino-japanese war , reformers and intellectuals debated how to strengthen the nation , the discussion of which centered on the issue of race liang qichao , a late qing reformist who participated in the hundred days ' reform of 1898 , contended that the boundary between han and man must be erased ( ping man-han zhi jie ) liang attributed the decline of china to the manchu ( qing ) rulers , who treated the han as an '' alien race '' and imposed a racial hierarchy between the han and the manchus while ignoring the threat of imperial powers liang 's critique of the qing court and the man-han relations laid the foundation for anti-manchuism , an ideology that early republican revolutionaries advocated in their efforts to overthrow the qing dynasty and found a new republic in his writing “ revolutionary army , ” zou rong , an active chinese revolutionary at the turn of the twentieth century , demanded a revolution education for the han people who were suffering from the oppression of the manchu rule while both japan and russia were encroaching china , the newly born republic also faced ethnic movements in mongolia and tibet which claimed themselves to be part of the qing empire rather than the republic of china in the context of social mobilization , chinese nationalism only fully emerged during the second sino-japanese war ( 1937-1945 ) , when the ccp mobilized the peasantry to fight against the japanese invaders johnson contends that early nationalism of the kuomintang was quite similar to the late nineteenth-century nationalism in europe , as both referred to the search for their national identities and positions in the modern world by the intelligentsia he argues that nationalism constructed by the intellectuals is not identical to nationalism based on mass mobilization , as the nationalist movements led by the kuomintang , as well as the may fourth movement in 1919 , were not mass movements because their participants were only a small proportion of the society where the peasants were simply absent when the second sino-japanese war broke out in 1937 , the ccp began to mobilize the chinese peasantry through mass propaganda of national salvation johnson observed that the primary shift of the ccp 's post-1937 propaganda was its focus on the discourse of national salvation and the temporary retreat of its communist agenda on class struggle and land redistribution the wartime alliance of the chinese peasantry and the ccp manifests how the nationalist ideology of the ccp , or the peasant nationalism , reinforced the desire of the chinese to save and build a strong nation on the other hand , chinese nationalism in taiwan was primarily about preserving the ideals and lineage of sun yat-sen , the party he founded , the kuomintang ( kmt ) , and anti-communism while the definition of chinese nationalism differed in the republic of china ( roc ) and the people 's republic of china ( prc ) , both are adamant in claiming chinese territories such as the senkaku islands and the nine-dash line in the south china sea in the 1990s , rising economic standards , the dissolution of soviet union , and the lack of any other legitimizing ideology has led to what most observers see as a resurgence of nationalism within mainland china the complexity of the relationship between ethnicity and the chinese identity is best exemplified during the taiping rebellion in which the rebels fought fiercely against the manchus on the ground that they were barbarian foreigners while at the same time others fought just as fiercely on behalf of the manchus on the grounds that they were the preservers of traditional chinese values it was during this time that the concept of han chinese came into existence as a means of describing the majority of chinese ethnicity due to sinicization in early chinese history in 1909 , the law of nationality of great qing was published by the manchu government , which defined chinese with the following rules : 1 ) born in china while his/her father is a chinese ; 2 ) born after his/her father 's death while his/her father is a chinese at his death ; 3 ) his/her mother is a chinese while his/her father 's nationality is unclear or stateless in 1919 , the may fourth movement grew out of student protests to the treaty of versailles , especially its terms allowing japan to shandong problem surrendered by germany after the siege of tsingtao , and spurned upsurges of chinese nationalism amongst the protests the official chinese nationalistic view in the 1920s and 1930s was heavily influenced by modernism and social darwinism , and included advocacy of the cultural assimilation of ethnic groups in the western and central provinces into the '' culturally advanced '' han state , to become in name as well as in fact members of the chinese nation over the next decades , chinese nationalism was influenced strongly by russian ethnographic thinking , and the official ideology of the prc asserts that china is a multi-ethnic state , and han chinese , despite being the overwhelming majority ( over 95 % in the mainland ) , they are only one of many ethnic groups of china , each of whose culture and language should be respected however , many critics argue that despite this official view , assimilationist attitudes remain deeply entrenched , and popular views and actual power relationships create a situation in which chinese nationalism has in practice meant han dominance of minority areas and peoples and assimilation of those groups hu songshan , a muslim imam from ningxia , was a chinese nationalist and preached chinese nationalism and unity of all chinese people , and also against foreign imperialism and other threats to china 's sovereignty it was reported that the muslim troops were going to wipe out the foreigners to return a golden age for china , and the muslims repeatedly attacked foreign churches , railways , and legations , before hostilities even started general bai chongxi , the warlord of guangxi , and a member of the kuomintang , presented himself as the protector of islam in china and harbored muslim intellectuals fleeing from the japanese invasion in guangxi while this was the commonly stated goal of both the people 's republic of china and the republic of china ( roc ) especially before 1991 , both sides differed sharply in the form of unification due to obvious and salient differences in political ideology despite this , the relationship between chinese nationalism and taiwan remains controversial , involving symbolic issues such as the use of '' the republic of china '' as the official name of the government on taiwan and the use of the word '' china '' in the name of government-owned corporations ( e.g the argument against unification is partly over culture and whether the taiwanese people should see themselves as chinese or taiwanese ; and partly over mistrust of the ruling chinese communist party ( ccp ) , such as its de-democratizing actions in hong kong ( e.g these misgivings are particularly prevalent amongst younger generations of taiwanese , who generally view both the ccp and the kmt as obsolete and consider themselves to have little connection to china except for ancestral cultural roots as a result , ethnic chinese in regional countries such as malaysia , singapore and thailand , as well as in the western world such as australia , canada and the united states were sharply divided over the concept of ethnic chinese from the concept of '' political chinese '' during the 1960s , the people 's republic of china ( prc ) and republic of china ( roc ) maintained different attitudes toward overseas chinese by contrast , the roc desired good relations with overseas chinese as part of an overall strategy to avoid increasing diplomatic isolation and maintain its claim to be the sole legitimate government of china , which ultimately culminated in the united nations general assembly resolution 2758 , when chiang 's regime lost its seat at the united nations with opening of china under deng xiaoping and the death of mao zedong , the prc 's attitude toward overseas chinese became much more favourable , and overseas chinese were seen as a source of capital and expertise while opponents have argued that reactionary nationalism is inherently unnecessary for a powerful nation , chinese nationalists assert that chinese nationalism was in many ways a result of western imperialism and is fundamental to the founding and stability of a modern chinese state furthermore , certain uyoku dantai are anti-chinese , to the extent which includes nanjing massacre denial or suppressing unit 731 , and nationalists say that a certain national consciousness is needed to defend or prevent such events from happening in china or against chinese people again sun yat sen , leader of the kuomintang ( kuomintang ) , known as the father of modern china ( in both the republic of china ( taiwan ) and the people 's republic of china ) , was a southern chinese with cantonese-hakka ancestry from their debates has emerged a multifarious populism nationalism which argues that anti-imperialist nationalism in china has provided a valuable public space for popular participation outside the country 's political institutions and that nationalist sentiments under the postcolonial condition represent a democratic form of civic activity it began to take recognizable shape after 1996 , as a joint result of the evolving nationalist thinking of the early 1990s and the ongoing debates on modernity , postmodernism , postcolonialism , and their political implications-debates that have engaged many chinese intellectuals since early 1995 as an indication of the popular and intellectual origins of recent chinese nationalist sentiment , all coauthors of china can say no , the first in a string of defiant rebuttals to american imperialism , are college educated , and most are self-employed ( a freelancer , a fruit-stand owner , a poet , and journalists working in the partly market-driven field of chinese newspapers , periodicals , and television stations ) another example of modern nationalism in china is the hanfu movement , which is a chinese movement in the early 21st century that seeks the revival of ancient chinese clothing some elements of the movement take inspiration from the use of indigenous clothing by ethnic minorities in china , as well as the usage of kimono in japan and clothing in india used in india many nationalists look for news of people whom they consider to be hanjian , such as the incident with grace wang from duke university , a chinese girl who allegedly tried to appease to both sides during the debate about tibet before the 2008 summer olympics in response to protests during the 2008 olympic torch relay and accusations of bias from the western media , chinese blogs , forums and websites became filled with nationalistic material , while flash counter-protests were generated through electronic means , such as the use of sms and im as xi jinping became the general secretary of the chinese communist party that solidified his control after 2012 , the ccp has used the phrase '' chinese dream '' , to describe his overarching plans for china xi first used the phrase during a high-profile visit to the national museum of china on 29 november 2012 , where he and his standing committee colleagues
