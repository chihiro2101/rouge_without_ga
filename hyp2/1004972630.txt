reverberation time is a measure of the time required for the sound to '' fade away '' in an enclosed area after the source of the sound has stopped when it comes to accurately measuring reverberation time with a meter , the term t 60 ( an abbreviation for reverberation time 60 & nbsp ; db ) is used it is defined as the time it takes for the sound pressure level to reduce by 60 & nbsp ; db , measured after the generated test signal is abruptly ended using a portable wind chest and organ pipes as a sound source , a stopwatch and his ears , he measured the time from interruption of the source to inaudibility ( a difference of roughly 60 & nbsp ; db ) the optimum reverberation time for a space in which music is played depends on the type of music that is to be played in the space basic factors that affect a room 's reverberation time include the size and shape of the enclosure as well as the materials used in the construction of the room under some restrictions , even simple sound sources like handclaps can be used for measurement of reverberation reverberation time is usually stated as a decay time and is measured in seconds it is often difficult to inject enough sound into the room to measure a decay of 60 & nbsp ; db , particularly at lower frequencies if the decay is linear , it is sufficient to measure a drop of 20 & nbsp ; db and multiply the time by 3 , or a drop of 30 & nbsp ; db and multiply the time by 2 the rt 60 reverberation time measurement is defined in the iso 3382-1 standard for performance spaces , the iso 3382-2 standard for ordinary rooms , and the iso 3382-3 for open-plan offices , as well as the astm e2235 standard the concept of reverberation time implicitly supposes that the decay rate of the sound is exponential , so that the sound level diminishes regularly , at a rate of so many db per second moreover , successive measurement of the sound level often yields very different results , as differences in phase in the exciting sound build up in notably different sound waves this is given by the equation : : t_ where critical distance d_c is measured in meters , volume v is measured in mÂ³ , and reverberation time rt 60 is measured in seconds the absorption coefficient of a material is a number between 0 and 1 which indicates the proportion of sound which is absorbed by the surface compared to the proportion which is reflected back to the room in order to employ the reverberant properties of the room , the composers are supposed to investigate and probe the sound response of that particular ambient , that will affect and inspire the creation of the musical work a spring reverb system uses a transducer at one end of a spring and a pickup at the other , similar to those used in plate reverbs , to create and capture vibrations within a metal spring one advantage over more sophisticated alternatives is that they lend themselves to the creation of special effects ; for example rocking them back and forth creates a thundering , crashing sound caused by the springs colliding with each other '' reverberation , or informally , '' reverb '' or '' verb '' , is one of the most universally used effects unit and is often found in guitar pedals , synthesizers , effects units , digital audio workstations ( daws ) and vst plug-ins it uses the mathematical convolution operation , a pre-recorded audio sample of the impulse response of the space being modeled , and the sound to be echoed , to produce the effect
