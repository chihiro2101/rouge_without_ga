the glycogen generation capacity is entirely dependent on , and determined by , the operating levels of the mitochondria in all of the cells of the human body ; however , the relation between the energy generated by the mitochondria and the glycogen capacity is very loose and is mediated by many biochemical pathways as a rule , mitochondrial diseases are worse when the defective mitochondria are present in the muscles , cerebrum , or nerves , because these cells use more energy than most other cells in the body if only a few of the mtdna copies inherited from the mother are defective , mitochondrial division may cause most of the defective copies to end up in just one of the new mitochondria ( for more detailed inheritance patterns , see human mitochondrial genetics ) the effective overall energy unit for the available body energy is referred to as the daily glycogen generation capacity , and is used to compare the mitochondrial output of healthy individuals to that of afflicted or chronically glycogen-depleted individuals examples of mitochondrial diseases include : mitochondrial myopathy diabetes mellitus and deafness ( dad ) this combination at an early age can be due to mitochondrial disease diabetes mellitus and deafness can be found together for other reasons leber 's hereditary optic neuropathy ( lhon ) visual loss beginning in young adulthood eye disorder characterized by progressive loss of central vision due to degeneration of the optic nerves and retina affects 1 in 50,000 people in finland leigh syndrome , subacute sclerosing encephalopathy after normal development the disease usually begins late in the first year of life , although onset may occur in adulthood a rapid decline in function occurs and is marked by seizures , altered states of consciousness , dementia , ventilatory failure neuropathy , ataxia , and retinitis pigmentosa ( narp ) progressive symptoms as described in the acronym dementia myoneurogenic gastrointestinal encephalopathy ( mngie ) gastrointestinal pseudo-obstruction neuropathy merrf syndrome progressive myoclonic epilepsy '' ragged red fibers '' are clumps of diseased mitochondria that accumulate in the subsarcolemmal region of the muscle fiber and appear when muscle is stained with modified gömöri trichrome stain short stature hearing loss lactic acidosis exercise intolerance melas syndrome mitochondrial dna depletion syndrome conditions such as friedreich 's ataxia can affect the mitochondria but are not associated with mitochondrial proteins the energy output of full healthy mitochondrial function can be predicted exactly by a complicated theoretical argument , but this argument is not straightforward , as most energy is consumed by the brain and is not easily measurable 572 knapton , sarah ( 1 march 2014 ) 'three-parent babies ' could be born in britain next year the daily telegraph science news , retrieved 1 march 2014 embryonic mitochondrial transplant and protofection have been proposed as a possible treatment for inherited mitochondrial disease , and allotopic expression of mitochondrial proteins as a radical treatment for mtdna mutation load acquired conditions in which mitochondrial dysfunction has been involved are : diabetes huntington 's disease cancer alzheimer 's disease parkinson 's disease bipolar disorder , schizophrenia , aging and senescence , anxiety disorders cardiovascular disease sarcopenia chronic fatigue syndrome the body , and each mutation , is modulated by other genome variants ; the mutation that in one individual may cause liver disease might in another person cause a brain disorder in all states , legislation prohibited the use of mrt techniques in the clinic , and except for western australia , research on a limited range of mrt was permissible up to day 14 of embryo development , subject to a license being granted although mitochondrial diseases vary greatly in presentation from person to person , several major clinical categories of these conditions have been defined , based on the most common phenotypic features , symptoms , and signs associated with the particular mutations that tend to cause them human mitochondrial dna encodes 13 proteins of the respiratory chain , while most of the estimated 1,500 proteins and components targeted to mitochondria are nuclear-encoded in june 2013 , the united kingdom government agreed to develop legislation that would legalize the 'three-person ivf ' procedure as a treatment to fix or eliminate mitochondrial diseases that are passed on from mother to child a study by yale university researchers ( published in the february 12 , 2004 , issue of the new england journal of medicine ) explored the role of mitochondria in insulin resistance among the offspring of patients with type 2 diabetes
