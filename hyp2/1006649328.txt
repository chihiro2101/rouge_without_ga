other memory types required constant power to retain data , such as vacuum tube or solid-state flip-flops , williams tubes , and semiconductor memory ( static or dynamic ram ) the memory contents were stored as a pattern of the last mask used for manufacturing the integrated circuit , and so could not be modified once completed some drawbacks to flash memory include the requirement to write it in larger blocks than many computers can automatically address , and the relatively limited longevity of flash memory due to its finite number of write-erase cycles ( as of january 2010 most consumer flash products can withstand only around 100,000 rewrites before memory begins to deteriorate ) several newer technologies are attempting to replace flash in certain roles , and some even claim to be a truly universal memory , offering the performance of the best sram devices with the non-volatility of flash for example , ibm pc 's and successors beginning with the ibm pc at used nonvolatile bios memory , often called cmos ram or parameter ram , and this was a common solution in other early microcomputer systems like the original apple macintosh , which used a small amount of memory powered by a battery for storing basic setup information like the selected boot volume ( the original ibm pc and pc xt instead used dip switches to represent up to 24 bits of system configuration data ; dip or similar switches are another , primitive type of programmable rom device that was widely used in the 1970s and 1980s for very small amounts of data & mdash ; typically no more than 8 bytes ) before industry standardization on the ibm pc architecture , some other microcomputer models used battery-backed ram more extensively : for example , in the trs-80 model 100/tandy 102 , all of the main memory ( 8 kb minimum , 32 kb maximum ) is battery-backed sram a huge advance in nvram technology was the introduction of the floating-gate mosfet transistor , which led to the introduction of erasable programmable read-only memory , or eprom in normal operation the chip functions as a fast sram and in case of power failure the content is quickly transferred to the eeprom part , from where it gets loaded back at the next power up memory storage density is the main determinant of cost in most computer memory systems , and due to this flash has evolved into one of the lowest cost solid-state memory devices available the power also needs time to be '' built up '' in a device known as a charge pump , which makes writing dramatically slower than reading , often as much as 1,000 times f-ram is a random-access memory similar in construction to dram but ( instead of a dielectric layer like in dram ) contains a thin ferroelectric film of lead zirconate titanate pb ( zr , ti ) o 3 , commonly referred to as pzt due to this crystal structure and how it is influenced , f-ram offers distinct properties from other nonvolatile memory options , including extremely high endurance ( exceeding 10 16 access cycles for 3.3 & nbsp ; v devices ) , ultra low power consumption ( since f-ram does not require a charge pump like other non-volatile memories ) , single-cycle write speeds , and gamma radiation tolerance another approach to see major development effort is magnetoresistive random-access memory , or mram , which uses magnetic elements and in general operates in a fashion similar to core , at least for the first-generation technology two second-generation techniques are currently in development : thermal assisted switching ( tas ) , which is being developed by crocus technology , and spin-transfer torque ( stt ) on which crocus , hynix , ibm , and several other companies are working in theory the technology offers storage densities on the order of 1 tbit/in² ( ≈394 gbit/cm² ) , greater than even the best hard drive technologies currently in use ( perpendicular recording offers 636 gbit/in² ( ≈250.4 gbit/cm² ) as of dec such devices are claimed to have the advantage that they utilise the same technology as hkmg ( high-l metal gate ) based lithography , and scale to the same size as a conventional fet at a given process node
