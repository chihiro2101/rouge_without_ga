owing to the crystalline structure of its thin films , which can be deposited by magnetron sputtering , for example , it shows characteristics superior to those of the commonly used amorphous al 2 o 3 '' by far the largest consumer of magnesia worldwide is the refractory industry , which consumed about 56 & nbsp ; % of the magnesia in the united states in 2004 , the remaining 44 & nbsp ; % being used in agricultural , chemical , construction , environmental , and other industrial applications magnesium oxide is used for relief of heartburn and dyspepsia , as an antacid , magnesium supplement , and as a short-term laxative : mg 2+ + ca ( oh ) 2 → mg ( oh ) 2 + ca 2+ calcining at different temperatures produces magnesium oxide of different reactivity calcining temperatures 1000 – 1500 & nbsp ; °c produce hard-burned magnesia , which has limited reactivity and calcining at lower temperature , ( 700–1000 & nbsp ; °c ) produces light-burned magnesia , a reactive form , also known as caustic calcined magnesia mgo is widely regarded as the most effective metals stabilization compound when compared to portland cement , lime , kiln dust products , power generation waste products , and various proprietary products due to mgo 's superior buffering capacity , cost effectiveness , and ease/safety of handling magnesium oxide is used extensively in the soil and groundwater remediation , wastewater treatment , drinking water treatment , air emissions treatment , and waste treatment industries for its acid buffering capacity and related effectiveness in stabilizing dissolved heavy metal species granular mgo is often blended into metals-contaminated soil or waste material , which is also commonly of a low ( acidic ) ph , in order to drive the ph into the 8–10 range where most metals are at their lowest solubilities the value of tunnel magnetoresistance is also significantly higher for mgo ( 600 % at room temperature and 1,100 & nbsp ; % at 4.2 k ) than al 2 o 3 ( ca it was historically used as a reference white color in colorimetry , owing to its good diffusing and reflectivity properties many heavy metals species , such as lead and cadmium are most soluble in water at acidic ph ( below 6 ) as well as high ph ( above 11 ) as a construction material , magnesium oxide wallboards have several attractive characteristics : fire resistance , termite resistance , moisture resistance , mold and mildew resistance , and strength in this process , the alkalinity of mgo ( and similar compounds ) neutralizes the relatively high acidity characteristic of low-quality paper , thus slowing the rate of deterioration
