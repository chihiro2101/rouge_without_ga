the epichlorohydrin process is the most important : it involves the chlorination of propylene to give allyl chloride , which is oxidized with hypochlorite to dichlorohydrins , which reacts with a strong base to give epichlorohydrin : because of the large-scale production of biodiesel from fats , where glycerol is a waste product , the market for glycerol is depressed as a sugar substitute , it has approximately 27 food energy per teaspoon ( sugar has 20 ) and is 60 % as sweet as sucrose glycerol has a caloric density similar to table sugar , but a lower glycemic index and different metabolic pathway within the body , so some dietary advocates accept glycerol as a sweetener compatible with low-carbohydrate diets it is also recommended as an additive when using polyol sweeteners such as erythritol and xylitol which have a cooling effect , due to its heating effect in the mouth , if the cooling effect is not wanted glycerol is used in medical , pharmaceutical and personal care preparations , often as a means of improving smoothness , providing lubrication , and as a humectant it is found in allergen immunotherapies , cough syrups , elixirs and expectorants , toothpaste , mouthwashes , skin care products , shaving cream , hair care products , soaps , and water-based personal lubricants taken rectally , glycerol functions as a laxative by irritating the anal mucosa and inducing a osmotic laxative , expanding the colon by drawing water into it to induce peristalsis resulting in defecation it may be administered undiluted either as a suppository or as a small-volume ( 2–10 & nbsp ; ml ) enema taken orally ( often mixed with fruit juice to reduce its sweet taste ) , glycerol can cause a rapid , temporary decrease in the intraocular pressure when utilized in '' tincture '' method extractions , specifically as a 10 % solution , glycerol prevents tannins from precipitating in ethanol extracts of plants ( tinctures ) does alcohol belong in herbal tinctures ? newhope.com when used as a primary '' true '' alcohol-free botanical extraction solvent in non-tincture based methodologies , glycerol has been shown to possess a high degree of extractive versatility for botanicals including removal of numerous constituents and complex compounds , with an extractive power that can rival that of alcohol and water–alcohol solutions glycerol is a stable preserving agent for botanical extracts that , when utilized in proper concentrations in an extraction solvent base , does not allow inverting or mitigates reduction-oxidation ( redox ) of a finished extract 's constituents , even over several years this glycerol is heated with an atomizer ( a heating coil often made of kanthal wire ) , producing the aerosol that delivers nicotine to the user while the minimum freezing point of a glycerol-water mixture is higher than an ethylene glycol-water mixture , glycerol is not toxic and is being re-examined for use in automotive applications in the laboratory , glycerol is a common component of solvents for enzyme reagents stored at temperatures below 0 & nbsp ; °c due to the freezing-point depression it is also used as a cryoprotectant where the glycerol is dissolved in water to reduce damage by ice crystals to laboratory organisms that are stored in frozen solutions , such as fungi , bacteria , nematodes , and mammalian embryos nitroglycerin , also known as glyceryl trinitrate ( gtn ) is commonly used to relieve angina pectoris , taken in the form of sub-lingual tablets , or as an aerosol spray glycerol , when poured into a gauge to replace the air space , reduces the harmonic vibrations that are transmitted to the needle , increasing the lifetime and reliability of the gauge glycerol can be sometimes used as replacement for water in ultrasonic testing , as it has favourably higher acoustic impedance ( 2.42mrayl vs 1.483mrayl for water ) while being relatively safe , non-toxic , non-corrosive and relatively low cost when the body uses stored fat as a source of energy , glycerol and fatty acids are released into the bloodstream glycerol injections can be used as a simple test for liver damage , as its rate of absorption by the liver is considered an accurate measure of liver health molecular human reproduction , volume 23 , issue 11 , november 2017 , pages 725–737 circulating glycerol does not glycate proteins as do glucose or fructose , and does not lead to the formation of advanced glycation endproducts ( ages ) in some organisms , the glycerol component can enter the glycolysis pathway directly and , thus , provide energy for cellular metabolism ( or , potentially , be converted to glucose through gluconeogenesis ) before glycerol can enter the pathway of glycolysis or gluconeogenesis ( depending on physiological conditions ) , it must be converted to their intermediate glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate in the following steps : the enzyme glycerol kinase is present mainly in the liver and kidneys , but also in other body tissues , including muscle and brain a sub-chronic 90-day nose-only inhalation study in sprague-dawley ( sd ) rats exposed to 0.03 , 0.16 and 0.66 & nbsp ; mg/l glycerin ( per liter of air ) for 6-hour continuous sessions revealed no treatment-related toxicity other than minimal metaplasia of the epithelium lining at the base of the epiglottis in rats exposed to 0.66 & nbsp ; mg/l glycerin between 1990 and 1998 , incidents of deg poisoning reportedly occurred in argentina , bangladesh , india , and nigeria , and resulted in hundreds of deaths
