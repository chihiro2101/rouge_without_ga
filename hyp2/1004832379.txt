there are a number of examples in condensed-matter physics where collective behavior leads to emergent phenomena that resemble magnetic monopoles in certain respects , making magnetic monopoles , and other exotica , in the lab , symmetry breaking , january 29 , 2009 in an electric dipole made of ordinary matter , the positive charge is made of protons and the negative charge is made of electrons , but a magnetic dipole does not have different types of matter creating the north pole and south pole lecture notes by robert littlejohn , university of california , berkeley , 2007–8 the electric charge is , in fact , quantized , which is consistent with ( but does not prove ) the existence of monopoles if magnetic charges do not exist & nbsp ; – or if they do exist but are not present in a region of space & nbsp ; – then the new terms in maxwell 's equations are all zero , and the extended equations reduce to the conventional equations of electromagnetism such as ) ; instead , they are sources for other fields , for example the -field , the '' -field '' ( related to superfluid vorticity ) , or various other quantum fields many early scientists attributed the magnetism of lodestones to two different '' magnetic fluids '' ( '' effluvia '' ) , a north-pole fluid at one end and a south-pole fluid at the other , which attracted and repelled each other in analogy to positive and negative electric charge however , an improved understanding of electromagnetism in the nineteenth century showed that the magnetism of lodestones was properly explained not by magnetic monopole fluids , but rather by a combination of electric currents , the electron magnetic moment , and the magnetic moments of other particles in some theoretical models , magnetic monopoles are unlikely to be observed , because they are too massive to create in particle accelerators ( see below ) , and also too rare in the universe to enter a particle detector with much probability with the inclusion of a variable for the density of these magnetic charges , say , there is also a '' magnetic current density '' variable in the equations , second , many elementary particles have an intrinsic magnetic moment , the most important of which is the electron magnetic dipole moment , which is related to its spin ( physics ) further advances in theoretical particle physics , particularly developments in grand unified theories and quantum gravity , have led to more compelling arguments ( detailed below ) that monopoles do exist they are not directly relevant to grand unified theories or other aspects of particle physics , and do not help explain charge quantization—except insofar as studies of analogous situations can help confirm that the mathematical analyses involved are sound the term dipole means two poles , corresponding to the fact that a dipole magnet typically contains a north pole on one side and a south pole on the other side one example of the work on magnetic monopole quasiparticles is a paper published in the journal science in september 2009 , in which researchers described the observation of quasiparticles resembling magnetic monopoles since 2009 , numerous news reports from the popular media have incorrectly described these systems as the long-awaited discovery of the magnetic monopoles , but the two phenomena are only superficially related to one another steven bramwell , a physicist at university college london who pioneered work on monopoles in spin ices , says that the 2014 experiment led by david hall is impressive , but that what it observed is not a dirac monopole in the way many people might understand it journal site , free access in this paper , dirac showed that if any magnetic monopoles exist in the universe , then all electric charge in the universe must be quantized ( dirac quantization condition )
