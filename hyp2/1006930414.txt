google books despite the fact that it is prepared from cyanide salts , prussian blue is not toxic because the cyanide groups are tightly bound to iron food and drug administration has determined the '' 500-mg prussian blue capsules , when manufactured under the conditions of an approved new drug application , can be found safe and effective therapy '' in certain poisoning cases in ideal insoluble pb crystals , the cubic framework is built from fe ( ii ) –c–n–fe ( iii ) sequences , with fe ( ii ) –carbon distances of 1.92 å and fe ( iii ) –nitrogen distances of 2.03 å from the beginning of the 18th century , prussian blue was the predominant uniform coat color worn by the infantry and artillery regiments of the prussian army in former times , the addition of iron ( ii ) salts to a solution of ferricyanide was thought to afford a material different from prussian blue '' insoluble '' prussian blue is produced if , in the reactions above , an excess of is added : :4 + 3 → & nbsp ;
