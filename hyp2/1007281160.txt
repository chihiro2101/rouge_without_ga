is : lenin tunnusti suomen tasan sata vuotta sitten – kohtasi suomalaisdelegaation pää painuksissa ja harmitteli myöhemmin lipsahdustaan ( in finnish ) this is how the meeting is told in svinhufvud 's biography svinhufvud ja itsenäisyyssenaatti written by erkki räikkönen : svinhufvud 's senate also authorized general mannerheim to form a new finnish army on the basis on white guard , the ( chiefly rightist ) volunteer militia called the suojeluskunta , an act simultaneously coinciding with the beginning of the civil war in finland after germany 's defeat in world war i , and the failed attempt to make finland a monarchy under the king of finland ( frederick charles of hesse was elected ) , svinhufvud withdrew from public life and was active only in the rightist suojeluskunta-militia svinhufvud was elected president in 1931 , and appointed mannerheim as chairman of the defence council , not least of all as an answer to the lapua movement 's fear of having fought the civil war in vain on the other hand , when a right-wing conservative member of parliament , edwin linkomies , proposed in 1934 that finland abandon parliamentarism in favour of a government led by the president and that the president be given an absolute veto power over the laws passed by the parliament , svinhufvud opposed his ideas svinhufvud strongly supported it , because he believed that it could effectively fight the great depression ( which it did , generally speaking ) , he believed that kivimäki had a strong personality like himself , and possibly because he hoped that the agrarians and swedish people 's party would let the kivimäki government remain in office as a lesser evil , the greater evil being an agrarian-social democratic government originally a moderate of the finnish party or old finnish party , after his dismissal svinhufvud became a strict constitutionalist who regarded the resistance of judges and officials as a question of justice , not believing that political expediency offered compromises : grand cross of the order of the white rose ( finland ) : grand cross of the order of the cross of liberty : collar of the order of the white lion , czechoslovakia ( 12 december 1931 ) : knight of the order of the seraphim , sweden ( 3 december 1932 ) : order of the white eagle ( poland ) : order of the cross of the eagle : order of merit of the kingdom of hungary svinhufvud refused to obey the orders of the russian procurator konstantin kazansky , which he considered illegal , and this led to his removal from office as a judge and being exiled to tomsk in siberia in november 1914 svinhufvud played a key role in the birth of a new parliamentary system in 1905 and he was elected as a young finnish party member of the new parliament in 1906 as head of his family , svinhufvud participated as a member of the estate of nobles in the diet of finland in 1894 and 1899–1906 on the other hand , he was realistic enough to admit privately to the german ambassador to finland , wipert von blücher , that if he was re-elected , he would be unable to keep the social democrats in the opposition svinhufvud was appointed as chairman of the senate on 27 november 1917 , and was a key figure in the announcement of finland 's declaration of independence on 6 december 1917 svinhufvud was not a supporter of parliamentarism , or to put it differently , he believed that the president had a right to choose the cabinet ministers after first consulting the parliamentary parties he moved to helsinki to work as a lawyer and participated in the political activities both of the diet and of a secret society , kagal he spent his early childhood at the home of his paternal grandfather , pehr gustaf svinhufvud af qvalstad ( a provincial treasurer of häme ) , at rapola , where the family had lived for five generations they had six children , yngve ( 1890–1991 ) , ilmo gretel ( 1892–1969 ) , aino mary ( 1893–1980 ) , eino ( 1896–1938 ) , arne ( 1904–1942 ) , and veikko ( 1908–1969 )
