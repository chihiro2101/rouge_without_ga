this is because the loan , when drawn on and spent , mostly finishes up as a deposit in the banking system ( an asset ) , which is counted as part of money supply ( and offsets the loan - which has yet to be repaid ) as the iterations continue , this multiplier is balanced ( or nullified ) by the equal and cumulative value of the loans , between the banks , creating a zero sum gain , and annulling the '' money creation '' claims or fears , that generally do not include or provision for the reality of reciprocating balancing , and net-offsets in their calculations , excluding double entry ( balanced book ) accounting principles in short , there are two types of money in a fractional-reserve banking system : central bank money — obligations of a central bank , including currency and central bank depository accounts commercial bank money — obligations of commercial banks , including checking accounts and savings accounts generally , the types of commercial bank money that tend to be valued at lower amounts are classified in the narrow category of m1 while the types of commercial bank money that tend to exist in larger amounts are categorized in m2 and m3 , with m3 having the largest the simple connection between monetary policy and monetary aggregates such as m1 and m2 changed in the 1970s as the reserve requirements on deposits started to fall with the emergence of money funds , which require no reserves this means that instead of the value of loans supplied responding passively to monetary policy , we often see it rising and falling with the demand for funds and the willingness of banks to lend this zero bound problem has been called the liquidity trap or '' pushing on a string '' ( the pusher being the central bank and the string being the real economy ) the '' m '' s usually range from m0 ( narrowest ) to m3 ( broadest ) but which '' m '' s are actually focused on in policy formulation depends on the country 's central bank the typical layout for each of the '' m '' s is as follows : inflation ( % δp ) is equal to the rate of money growth ( % δ , plus the change in velocity ( % δ , minus the rate of output growth ( % δ so if in the long run the growth rate of velocity and the growth rate of real gdp are exogenous constants ( the former being dictated by changes in payment institutions and the latter dictated by the growth in the economy ’ s productive capacity ) , then the monetary growth rate and the inflation rate differ from each other by a fixed constant a central bank may attempt to do this by artificially influencing the demand for goods by increasing or decreasing the nation 's money supply ( relative to trend ) , which lowers or raises interest rates , which stimulates or restrains spending on goods and services an important debate among economists in the second half of the twentieth century concerned the central bank 's ability to predict how much money should be in circulation , given current employment rates and inflation rates this is why they advocated a non-interventionist approach—one of targeting a pre-specified path for the money supply independent of current economic conditions—even though in practice this might involve regular intervention with open market operations ( or other monetary-policy tools ) to keep the money supply on target federal reserve , ben bernanke , suggested in 2004 that over the preceding 10 to 15 years , many modern central banks became relatively adept at manipulation of the money supply , leading to a smoother business cycle , with recessions tending to be smaller and less frequent than in earlier decades , a phenomenon termed '' the great moderation '' speech , bernanke – the great moderation furthermore , it may be that the functions of the central bank may need to encompass more than the shifting up or down of interest rates or bank reserves : these tools , although valuable , may not in fact moderate the volatility of money supply ( or its velocity ) a program for monetary reform american monetary institute bank regulation capital requirement central bank chartalism chicago plan the chicago plan revisited committee on monetary and economic reform core inflation debt levels and flows economics terminology that differs from common usage fiat currency financial capital float fractional-reserve banking fred ( federal reserve economic data ) full reserve banking great contraction index of leading indicators – money supply is a component inflation monetarism monetary base monetary economics monetary reform money circulation money creation money market money demand liquidity preference seigniorage stagflation article in the new palgrave on money supply by milton friedman do all banks hold reserves , and , if so , where do they hold them ?
