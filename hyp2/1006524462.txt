in 1922 , after several risqué films and a series of off-screen scandals involving hollywood stars , the studios enlisted presbyterian elder will h hollywood in the 1920s was rocked by a number of notorious scandals , such as the murder of william desmond taylor and alleged rape of virginia rappe by popular movie star roscoe '' fatty '' arbuckle , which brought widespread condemnation from religious , civic , and political organizations faced with the prospect of having to comply with hundreds , and potentially thousands , of inconsistent and easily changed decency laws in order to show their movies , the studios chose self-regulation as the preferable option served for 25 years as president of the motion picture association of america ( mppda ) , where he '' defended the industry from attacks , recited soothing nostrums , and negotiated treaties to cease hostilities '' the move mimicked the decision major league baseball had made in hiring judge kenesaw mountain landis as league commissioner the previous year to quell questions about the integrity of baseball in the wake of the black sox scandal ; the new york times even called hays the '' screen landis '' '' in 1924 , hays introduced a set of recommendations dubbed '' the formula '' , which the studios were advised to heed , and asked filmmakers to describe to his office the plots of pictures they were planning on making and while there had been token attempts to clean up the movies before—such as when the studios formed the national association of the motion picture industry ( nampi ) in 1916—little had come of the efforts the list was approved by the federal trade commission ( ftc ) , and hays created the studio relations committee ( src ) to oversee its implementation ; vieira ( 1999 ) , p in a resolution passed on june 29 , 1927 , the motion picture producers and distributors of america codified a lists of '' don'ts '' and '' be carefuls '' into what they colloquially called their '' magna carta '' 301–302 specifically , the mppda resolved , '' that those things which are included in the following list shall not appear in pictures produced by the members of this association , irrespective of the manner in which they are treated '' : in 1929 , a catholic layman , martin quigley ( editor of the prominent trade paper motion picture herald ) and the jesuit priest father daniel a the production code was intended to put a limitation on films which were distributed to a large audience , making it more difficult to appeal to all individuals in the audiences the first was a set of '' general principles '' which prohibited a picture from '' lowering the moral standards of those who see it '' , so as not to wrongly influence a specific audience of views including , women , children , lower-class , and those of “ susceptible ” minds , called for depictions of the '' correct standards of life '' , and lastly forbade a picture to show any sort of ridicule towards a law or '' creating sympathy for its violation '' the production code of the motion picture producers and distributors of america , inc it also stated that the notion of an '' adults-only policy '' would be a dubious , ineffective strategy that would be difficult to enforce ; doherty ( 1999 ) , p all criminal action had to be punished , and neither the crime nor the criminal could elicit sympathy from the audience , or the audience must at least be aware that such behavior is wrong , usually through '' compensating moral value '' under some circumstances , politicians , police officers , and judges could be villains , as long as it was clear that those individuals portrayed as villains were the exceptions to the rule on february 19 , 1930 , variety published the entire content of the code and predicted that state film censorship boards would soon become obsolete ; black ( 1996 ) , pp the first film the office reviewed , the blue angel , which was passed by joy with no revisions , was considered indecent by a california censor in 1930 , the hays office did not have the authority to order studios to remove material from a film , and instead worked by reasoning and sometimes pleading with them one factor in ignoring the code was the fact that some found such censorship prudish , owing to the libertine social attitudes of the 1920s and early 1930s the outlook agreed , and , unlike variety , the outlook predicted from the beginning that the code would be difficult to enforce in 1931 , the hollywood reporter mocked the code and quoted an anonymous screenwriter saying that '' the hays moral code is not even a joke any more ; it 's just a memory '' ; two years later variety followed suit on june 13 , 1934 , an amendment to the code was adopted which established the production code administration ( pca ) and required all films released on or after july 1 , 1934 , to obtain a certificate of approval before being released for more than thirty years , virtually all motion pictures produced in the united states adhered to the code the production code was not created or enforced by federal , state , or city government ; the hollywood studios adopted the code in large part in the hopes of avoiding government censorship , preferring self-regulation to government regulation breen — a prominent catholic layman who had worked in public relations — was appointed head of the new production code administration ( pca ) under breen 's leadership of the pca , which lasted until his retirement in 1954 , enforcement of the production code became notoriously rigid breen influenced the production of casablanca , objecting to any explicit reference to rick and ilsa having slept together in paris and to the film mentioning that captain renault extorted sexual favors from his supplicants ; however , both remained strongly implied in the finished version of virginia ( 2000–01 ) , '' censored '' adherence to the code also ruled out any possibility of the film ending with rick and ilsa consummating their adulterous love , making inevitable the ending with rick 's noble renunciation , one of casablancas most famous scenes the first major instance of censorship under the production code involved the 1934 film tarzan and his mate , in which brief nude scenes involving a body double for actress maureen o'sullivan were edited out of the master negative of the film wanted to make a film about nazi concentration camps , the production office forbade it—citing the above-mentioned prohibition on depicting '' in an unfavorable light '' another country 's '' institutions and prominent people '' —with threats to take the matter to the federal government if the studio went ahead in 1938 , the fbi unearthed and prosecuted a nazi spy ring , subsequently allowing warner to produce confessions of a nazi spy , holden ( 2008 ) , p the code began to weaken in the late 1940s , when the formerly taboo subjects of rape and miscegenation were allowed in johnny belinda ( 1948 ) and pinky ( 1949 ) , respectively in 1951 , the mpaa revised the code to make it more rigid ; the 1951 revisions spelled out more words and subjects that were prohibited hollywood continued to work within the confines of the production code throughout the 1950s , but during this time , the movie industry was faced with very serious competitive threats in addition to the threat of television , there was also increasing competition from foreign films , such as vittorio de sica 's bicycle thieves ( 1948 ) , the swedish film one summer of happiness ( 1951 ) , and ingmar bergman 's summer with monika ( 1953 ) vertical integration in the movie industry had been found to violate anti-trust laws , and studios had been forced to give up ownership of theaters by the supreme court in united states v some british films — victim ( 1961 ) , a taste of honey ( 1961 ) , and the leather boys ( 1963 ) — challenged traditional gender roles , and openly confronted the prejudices against homosexuals , all in clear violation of the hollywood production code industrial commission of ohio ) and held that motion pictures were entitled to first amendment protection , so that the new york state board of regents could not ban the miracle , a short film that was one half of l'amore ( 1948 ) , an anthology film directed by roberto rossellini that reduced the threat of government regulation , which had formerly been cited as justification for the production code , and the pca 's powers over the hollywood industry were greatly reduced for example , the re-make of a pre-code film dealing with prostitution , anna christie , was cancelled by mgm twice , in 1940 and in 1946 , as the character of anna was not allowed to be portrayed as a prostitute by 1962 , such subject matter was acceptable , and the original film was given a seal of approval by the late 1950s , increasingly explicit films began to appear , such as anatomy of a murder ( 1959 ) , suddenly , last summer ( 1959 ) , psycho ( 1960 ) , and the dark at the top of the stairs ( 1960 ) owing to its themes , billy wilder 's some like it hot ( 1959 ) was not granted a certificate of approval , but it still became a box office smash , and , as a result , it further weakened the authority of the code hirsch ( 2007 ) at the forefront of contesting the code was director otto preminger , whose films violated the code repeatedly in the 1950s his 1953 film the moon is blue , about a young woman who tries to play two suitors off against each other by claiming that she plans to keep her virginity until marriage , was released without a certificate of approval he later made the man with the golden arm ( 1955 ) , which portrayed the prohibited subject of drug abuse , and anatomy of a murder ( 1959 ) , which dealt with murder and rape hirsch ( 2007 ) in the early 1960s , films began to deal with adult subjects and sexual matters that had not been seen in hollywood films since the early 1930s leff & simmons ( 2001 ) in 1964 , the holocaust film the pawnbroker , directed by sidney lumet and starring rod steiger , was initially rejected because of two scenes in which the actresses linda geiser and thelma oliver fully expose their breasts , as well as because of a sex scene between oliver and jaime sánchez described as '' unacceptably sex suggestive and lustful '' despite the rejection , the film 's producers arranged for allied artists to release the film without the production code seal , with the new york censors licensing the film without the cuts demanded by code administrators on a 6-3 vote , the mpaa granted the film an exception , conditional on '' reduction in the length of the scenes which the production code administration found unapprovable '' the requested reductions of nudity were minimal ; the outcome was viewed in the media as a victory for the film 's producers the exception to the code was granted as a '' special and unique case '' and was described by the new york times at the time as '' an unprecedented move that will not , however , set a precedent '' in pictures at a revolution , a 2008 study of films during that era , mark harris wrote that the mpaa approval was '' the first of a series of injuries to the production code that would prove fatal within three years '' the mpaa film rating system went into effect on november 1 , 1968 , with the four rating symbols : g means suggested for general exhibition ( persons of all ages admitted ) , m means suggested for mature audiences , r means suggested as restricted ( persons under 16 not admitted unless accompanied by a parent or adult guardian ) , and x means persons under 16 will not be admitted in 1970 , because of confusion over the meaning of '' mature audiences '' , the m rating was changed to gp meaning '' for general exhibition , but parental guidance is suggested '' in 1984 , in response to public complaints regarding the severity of horror elements in pg-rated titles such as gremlins and indiana jones and the temple of doom , the pg-13 rating was created as a middle tier between pg and r in 1990 , the x rating was replaced by nc-17 ( under 17 not admitted ) , partly because of the stigma associated with the x rating , and partly because the x rating was not trademarked by the mpaa ; pornography bookstores and theaters were using their own x , xx , and xxx symbols to market products as the american humane association 's hollywood office depended on the hays office for the right to monitor sets , the closure of the hays office in 1966 corresponded with an increase in animal cruelty on movie sets the celluloid closet censorship in the united states code of practices for television broadcasters , which served the same purpose for television series comics code authority , which functioned similarly for the comics industry entertainment software rating board , which offers ratings for video games intimacy coordinator , role which assists actors list of pre-code films pmrc , a similar group , which sought to control musical content with the parental advisory sticker pre-code hollywood pre-code sex films this film is not yet rated '' queering the ( new ) deal : lesbian and gay representation and the depression-era cultural politics of hollywood 's production code '' , cinema journal ( 38 ) 2 : pp motion picture producers and distributors of america , '' the don'ts and be carefuls '' ( 1927 ) censored films and television at university of virginia online motion picture association of america : history and film ratings bibliography of books articles about movie censorship ( via uc berkeley ) complete list of the 36 '' don'ts and be carefuls '' of 1927 complete text of the motion picture production code of 1930 ( without the subsequent amendments ) the production code of the motion picture industry ( includes examples , all amendments , the 1956 rewrite , and 1966 rewrite ) more sinned against than sinning : the fabrications of '' pre-code cinema '' talking pictures website : article by nigel watson about film censorship issues accompanied by classroom activities for students numbered list of production code certificates of approval
