gauquelin 's work was not limited to the mars effect : his calculations led him first to reject most of the conventions of natal astrology as it is practised in the modern west but he singled out '' highly significant statistical correlations between planetary positions and the birth times of eminently successful people in 1983 abell , kurtz and zelen ( see below ) published a reappraisal , rejecting the idea of demographic errors , saying , “ gauquelin adequately allowed for demographic and astronomical factors in predicting the expected distribution of mars sectors for birth times in the general population then professor marvin zelen , a statistician and associate of the recently founded committee for the scientific investigation of claims of the paranormal ( csicop , now known as the committee for skeptical inquiry ( csi ) ) , proposed in a 1976 article in the same periodical that , in order to eliminate any demographic anomaly , gauquelin randomly pick 100 athletes from his data-set of 2,088 and check the birth/planet correlations of a sample of babies born at the same times and places in order to establish a control group , giving the base-rate ( chance ) expectation for comparison ( the 100 random athletes later expanded into a subsample of 303 athletes ) in a rebuttal of the gauquelins ' published conclusion , marvin zelen analysed the composition , not of the 17,000 non-champions of the control group , but of the 303 champions , splitting this secondary subsample ( which was already nearly too small to test 22 % vs 17 % ) by eliminating female athletes , a subgroup that gave the results most favourable to gauquelin , and dividing the remaining athletes into city/rural sections and parisian/non-parisian sections rawlins privately urged that the gauquelins ' results were valid and the “ zelen test ” could only uphold this and that zelen had diverted from the original purpose of the control test , which was to check the base rate of births with mars in the '' key '' sectors it appeared to him that the test had minimised the significance of the mars/key-sector correlations with athletes by splitting the sample of athletes and that the experimenters , who were supposed to be upholding scientific standards , were actually distorting and manipulating evidence to conceal the result of an ill-considered test we find an inverse correlation between size and deviation in the mars-athletes subsamples ( that is , the smaller the subsample , the larger the success ) – which is what one would expect if bias had infected the blocking off of the sizes of the subsamples '' in 1994 the results of a major study undertaken by the committee for the study of paranormal phenomena ( comité pour l ’ étude des phénomènes paranormaux , or cfepp ) in france found no evidence whatsoever of a '' mars effect '' in the births of athletes in 1990 the cfepp had issued a preliminary report on the study , which used 1,066 french sports champions , giving full data for the 1,066 as well as the names of 373 who fit the criteria but for whom birth times were unavailable , discussing methodology and listing data-selection criteria nienhuys and several letters from gauquelin to the committee , was published in book form as the mars effect – a french test of over 1,000 sports champions the cfepp stated that its experiment showed no effect and concluded that the effect was attributable to bias in gauquelin ’ s data selection , pointing to the suggestions made by gauquelin to the committee for changes in their list of athletes there is about a 25 % chance to find at least one such combination ( of one planet and two sectors ) for a random dataset of the same size as gauquelin ’ s that would yield a result with apparent statistical significance like the one obtained by gauquelin skeptic magazine vol 16 1 , 2010 this implies that after adjusting for multiple comparisons , the mars effect is no longer statistically significant even at the modest significance level of 0.05 and is probably a false positive is the '' mars effect '' genuine ? , journal of scientific exploration , vol 11 , 1 , spring 1997 , 19–39
