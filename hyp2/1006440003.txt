they generally use the intermediate value theorem , which asserts that if a continuous function has values of opposite signs at the end points of an interval , then the function has at least one root in the interval however , in the case of polynomials there are other methods ( descartes ' rule of signs , budan 's theorem and sturm 's theorem ) for getting information on the number of roots in an interval the false position method , also called the regula falsi method , is similar to the bisection method , but instead of using bisection search 's middle of the interval it uses the -intercept of the line that connects the plotted function values at the endpoints of the interval , that is : c \frac , that is a slower convergence than with three steps of newton 's method applying vieta 's formulas , one obtains easy approximations for the modulus of the roots , and with some more effort , for the roots themselves by bounding the modulus of the roots and recursively subdividing the initial region indicated by these bounds , one can isolate small regions that may contain roots and then apply other methods to locate them exactly finding the real roots of a polynomial with real coefficients is a problem that has received much attention since the beginning of 19th century , and is still an active domain of research it follows that the standard way of computing real roots is to compute first disjoint intervals , called isolating intervals , such that each one contains exactly one real root , and together they contain all the roots having isolating interval , one may use fast numerical methods , such as newton 's method for improving the precision of the result with these improvements they reach a computational complexity that is similar to that of the best algorithms for computing all the roots ( even when all roots are real ) however , for polynomials whose coefficients are exactly given as integers or rational numbers , there is an efficient method to factorize them into factors that have only simple roots and whose coefficients are also exactly given this method , called square-free factorization , is based on the multiple roots of a polynomial being the roots of the greatest common divisor of the polynomial and its derivative
