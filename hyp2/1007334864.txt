he was named for his uncle john cleves symmes , a delegate to the continental congress , a colonel in the revolutionary war , chief justice of new jersey , father-in-law of us president william henry harrison and pioneer in the settlement and development of the northwest territory though justice symmes had no male children , the younger john cleves symmes was often referred to by his later military rank , or with the suffix of '' jr symmes '' received a good common english education '' and on march 26 , 1802 , at the age of twenty-two , obtained a commission as an ensign in the us army ( with the assistance of his uncle ) but while failing as a trader , symmes was contemplating the rings of saturn and developing his theory of the hollow earthâ€”a theory which he would spend the remainder of his life promoting on april 10 , 1818 , symmes announced his hollow earth theory to the world , publishing his circular no symmes had sent his declaration ( at considerable cost to himself ) to '' each notable foreign government , reigning prince , legislature , city , college , and philosophical societies , throughout the union , and to individual members of our national legislature , as far as the five hundred copies would go symmes proposed that the curvature of the rim of these polar openings was gradual enough that it would be possible to actually enter the inner earth without being aware of the transition he argued that due to the centrifugal force of earth 's rotation , the earth would be flattened at the poles , leading to a vast passage into the inner earth symmes ' concept of polar openings connecting the earth 's surface to the inner earth was to be his unique contribution to hollow earth lore ultimately , symmes was to simplify his theory , abandoning the series of concentric inner spheres , and teaching '' only one concentric sphere ( a hollow earth ) , not five '' by the time he embarked on his lecture tour of the east coast while the idea of polar openings leading into a hollow earth was symmes ' innovation , the concept of a hollow earth had an intellectual pedigree dating back to the 17th century and edmond halley halley proposed his hollow earth theory as an explanation for the different locations of the geographic and magnetic poles of the earth the version of the hollow earth theory ascribed to euler lacked the concentric spheres of halley 's proposal , but added the element of an interior sun symmes disciple , james mcbride , promoting and explain symmes theory in his book , symmes 's theory of concentric spheres ( 1826 ) , cited euler as an earlier proponent of a similar theory and in 1820 , symmes began to promote his theory directly , lecturing on it in cincinnati and other towns and cities in the region , making use of a wooden globe with the polar sections removed to reveal the inner earth and the spheres within symmes ' eldest son , americus symmes , was seventeen when his father died , leaving him as the sole support of the family , with an estate significantly in debt he also championed his father 's legacy , erecting a memorial to him ( a pylon topped with a globe carved in the shape of a hollow sphere ) and publishing in 1878 an edited collection of his father 's papers , symmes 's theory of concentric spheres : demonstrating that the earth is hollow , habitable within , and widely open about the poles , compiled by americus symmes , from the writings of his father , capt samuel highgate syme , the subject of the syme papers in benjamin markovits ' book of the same name , is based on john cleves symmes
