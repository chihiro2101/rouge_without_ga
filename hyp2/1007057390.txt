an emphasis on the importance of honour exists in such traditional institutions as the military ( serving officers may conduct a court of honour ) and in organisations with a military ethos , such as scouting organisations ( which also feature '' courts of honour '' ) the concept of honour appears to have declined in importance in the modern west ; conscience has replaced it in the individual context , and the rule of law ( with the rights and duties defined therein ) has taken over in a social context honour in the case of sexuality frequently relates , historically , to fidelity : preservation of '' honour '' equates primarily to maintenance of the virginity of singles and to the exclusive monogamy of the remainder of the population further conceptions of this type of honour vary widely between cultures ; some cultures regard honour killings of ( mostly female ) members of one 's own family as justified if the individuals have '' defiled the family 's honour '' by marrying against the family 's wishes , or even by becoming the victims of rape brewer , cambridge , for a person to say '' on my honour '' was not just an affirmation of his or her integrity and rank , but the veracity behind that phrase meant he or she was willing to offer up estates as pledge and guarantee in contemporary international relations , the concept of '' credibility '' resembles that of honour , as when the credibility of a state or of an alliance appears to be at stake , and honour-bound politicians call for drastic measures to dishonour an agreement could be economically ruinous , because all future potential transaction partners might stop trusting the party not to lie , steal their money or goods , not repay debts , mistreat the children they marry off , have children with other people , abandon their children , or fail to provide aid when needed a code of honour differs from a legal code , also socially defined and concerned with justice , in that honour remains implicit rather than explicit and objectified presidents who were raised in the american south '' are shown to be twice as likely to involve uses of force , last on average twice as long , and are three times more likely to end in victory for the united states than disputes under non-southern presidents skinners , executioners , gravedigger , shepherds , barber surgeon , millers , linen-weavers , sow-gelders , latrine-cleaners , and bailiffs and their families were among the '' dishonourable people '' ( unehrliche leute ) in early modern german society the ancient greek concepts of honour ( timÄ“ ) included not only the exaltation of the one receiving honour , but also the shaming of the one overcome by the act of hubris inspired by the righteous nature of the seonbi , the modern korean term of the '' seonbi spirit '' calls for maintaining personal honour and conduct , even in the face of certain death a culture of law incorporates a social contract : members of society give up some aspects of their freedom to defend themselves and retaliate for injuries , on the understanding that society will apprehend and punish transgressors
