the vlt consists of an arrangement of four large ( 8.2 metre diameter ) telescopes ( called unit telescopes or uts ) with optical elements that can combine them into an astronomical interferometer ( vlti ) , which is used to resolve small objects eso vlti official site for the interferometer ( combining the telescopes ) auxiliary telescopes - very large telescope interferometer full list of the vlt instruments including those of vlti worldwide telescope web client including archives from the vlt vlt images eso interferometry delay lines for the very large telescopes dutch space travelogue vlt visit world 's toughest fixes bond paranal website . only targets which are at temperatures of more than 1,000°c have a surface brightness high enough to be observed in the mid-infrared , and objects must be at several thousands of degrees celsius for near-infrared observations using the vlti one of the large mirrors of the telescopes was the subject of an episode of the national geographic channel 's reality series world 's toughest fixes , where a crew of engineers removed and transported the mirror to be cleaned and re-coated with aluminium in march 2019 , eso astronomers , employing the instruments on their very large telescope interferometer ( vlti ) , announced the first direct detection of an exoplanet , hr 8799 e , using interferometry the vlt 's 8.2-meter telescopes were originally designed to operate in three modes : as a set of four independent telescopes ( this is the primary mode of operation ) because of the many mirrors involved in the optical train , about 95 percent of the light is lost before reaching the instruments at a wavelength of 1 & nbsp ; µm , 90 percent at 2 & nbsp ; µm and 75 percent at 10 & nbsp ; µm the first two instruments at the vlti were vinci ( a test instrument used to set up the system , now decommissioned ) and midi , which only allow two telescopes to be used at any one time in march 2011 , the pionier instrument for the first time simultaneously combined the light of the four unit telescopes , potentially making vlti the biggest optical telescope in the world because the unit telescopes are used most of the time independently , they are used in the interferometric mode mostly during bright time ( that is , close to full moon ) using the big telescopes and coherent integration , the faintest object the vlti can observe is magnitude 7 in the near infrared for broadband observations , similar to many other near infrared / optical interferometers without fringe tracking deployment of the phase referenced imaging and microarcsecond astrometry ( prima ) instrument started 2008 with the aim to allow phase-referenced measurements in either an astrometric two-beam mode or as a fringe-tracker successor to vinci , operated concurrent with one of the other instruments
