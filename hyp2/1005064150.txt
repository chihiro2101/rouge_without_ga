fry was an advocate of an increasingly abstract art and design practice , and the studio/gallery/retail outlet allowed him to employ and support artists in sympathy with this approach , such as wyndham lewis , frederick etchells , cuthbert hamilton and edward wadsworth lewis had made an impact at the allied artists ’ salon the previous year with a huge virtually abstract work , kermesse ( now lost ) , clive bell in the athenaeum of 27 july 1912 explained that , in order to appreciate this work , visitors ‘ having shed all irrelevant prejudices in favour of representation will be able to contemplate it as a piece of pure design ’ lewis curated the exhibition ’ s ‘ cubist room ’ and provided a written introduction in which he attempted to cohere the various strands of abstraction on display : ‘ these painters are not accidently associated here , but form a vertiginous , but not exotic , island in the placid and respectable archipelago of english art it was to be a platform for the art and ideas of lewis ’ s circle , and a lecture series included talks by lewis ’ s friend the poet ezra pound , the novelist ford madox hueffer ( later ford madox ford ) and the italian ‘ futurist ’ , filippo tommaso marinetti a few weeks later , lewis took out an advertisement in the spectator to announce the publication of ‘ the manifesto of the vorticists ’ – an english abstract art movement that was a ‘ parallel movement to cubism and expressionism ’ and would , the advertisement promised , be a ‘ death blow to impressionism and futurism ’ initially in correspondence in late 1913 and then in an informal talk at the rebel art centre in april 1914 ( philip rylands , ‘ introduction ’ , in antliff & greene ( eds however , for pound there was a more specific – if obscure – meaning : ‘ the vortex was that point in the cyclone where energy cuts into space and imparts form to it … the pattern of angles and geometric lines which is formed by our vortex in the existing chaos lewis ’ s vorticist manifesto was to be published in a new literary and art journal , blast – ironically , the journal ’ s title had been suggested by nevinson , who was now persona non grata since the ‘ vital english art ’ manifesto the french sculptor , painter and anarchist henri gaudier-brzeska had met ezra pound in july 1913 , mark antliff , ‘ sculptural nominalism/anarchist vortex ’ , in antliff & greene ( eds two women artists , helen saunders and jessica dismorr , who had turned to ‘ cubist works ’ in 1913 , joined the rebels – and , although they were not regarded highly by the men , brigid peppin argues that saunders ’ s ‘ juxtapositions of strong and unexpected colour ’ may have influenced lewis ’ s later use of forceful colour ‘ vorticism ’ was given assured longevity through the dazzling typography and the audacious ( and humorous ) ‘ blasting ’ and ‘ blessing ’ of myriad sacred cows of english and american culture that appeared in the first issue of blast : the review of the great english vortex , published in july 1914 image : bomberg , the mud bath.jpg thumb 180x240px left david bomberg , the mud bath , 1914 , tate blast was launched at a ‘ riotous celebratory dinner ’ cork , vorticism and its allies , p the magazine was mainly the work of lewis , but also included extensive written pieces by ford madox hueffer and rebecca west , as well as poetry by pound , articles by gaudier-brzeska and wadsworth , and reproductions of paintings by lewis , wadsworth , etchells , roberts , epstein , gaudier-brzeska and hamilton lewis , pound and gaudier-brzeska were at the intellectual heart of the project , but roberts ’ s later comments suggest that most of the group were not made aware of the manifesto ’ s contents before publication jacob epstein was presumably too established to be co-opted as a signatory , and david bomberg had threatened lewis with legal action if his work was reproduced in blast and made his independence very clear through a one-man show at the chenil galleries , also in july , where his large abstract painting mud bath was prominently displayed outside above the entrance the forty-nine ‘ vorticist ’ works by dismorr , etchells , gaudier-brzeska , lewis , one of the few surviving paintings from this exhibition is wyndham lewis ’ s workshop c.1914–15 in the tate collection a catalogue foreword by lewis clarified that ‘ by vorticism we mean ( a ) activity as opposed to the tasteful passivity of picasso ( b ) significance as opposed to the dull anecdotal character to which the naturalist is condemned ( c ) essential movement and activity ( such as the energy of the mind ) as opposed to the imitative cinematography , the fuss and hysterics of the futurists a ‘ notice to public ’ in the second number of blast explained that the publication had been delayed ‘ due to the war chiefly ’ and to ‘ the illness of the editor at the time it should have appeared and before ’ , blast : war number , published july 1915 , p understandably , he tried to strike an optimist tone with regard to the future of vorticism and blast ; however , within a year most of the artists had enlisted or volunteered in the armed forces : lewis – royal garrison artillery ; roberts – royal field artillery ; wadsworth – british naval intelligence ; bomberg – royal engineers ; dismorr – voluntary air detachment ; and saunders – government office work see william roberts , memories of the war to end war 1914–18 ( london , 1974 ) for an account of life on the front line and the commissioning processes for war artists towards the end of the war the journalist paul konody , now art adviser to the canadian war memorials fund ( and someone who had been blatantly anti-vorticism ) , commissioned lewis , wadsworth , nevinson , bomberg , roberts , paul nash and bomberg to produce monumental canvases on subjects relating to the canadian war experience for a projected memorial hall in ottawa athletes exercising in a gymnasium

hamilton , lewis , roberts and wadsworth – and they were joined by the sculptor frank dobson , the painter charles ginner , the american graphic designer edward mcknight kauffer , and the painter john turnbull an anecdote recorded by brigid peppin relates how helen saunders ’ s sister used a vorticist oil to cover her larder floor and ‘ it was worn to destruction ’ peppin , ‘ women that a movement forgot ’ , p writing in 1974 , richard cork , noted that ‘ thirty-eight of the forty-nine works displayed by the full members of the movement at the 1915 vorticist exhibition are now missing despite a resurgence of abstract art in britain in the middle years of the twentieth century , the contribution of vorticism was largely forgotten until a spat between john rothenstein of the tate gallery and william roberts blew up in the press and the inclusion of work by bomberg , roberts , wadsworth , nevinson , dobson , kramer under the heading ‘ other vorticists ’ – together with lewis ’ s assertion that 'vorticism , in fact , was what i , personally , did , and said , at a certain period ' – incensed roberts as it seemed that he and the others were being set up to be mere disciples of lewis the
