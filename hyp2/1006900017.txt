traditionally , cam has been considered a numerical control ( nc ) programming tool , wherein two-dimensional ( 2-d ) or three-dimensional ( 3-d ) models of components are generated in cad early commercial applications of cam were in large companies in the automotive and aerospace industries ; for example , pierre b√©ziers work developing the cad/cam application unisurf in the 1960s for car body design and tooling at renault usually it had been necessary to force the cad operator to export the data in one of the common data formats , such as iges or stl or parasolid formats that are supported by a wide variety of software the output from the cam software is usually a simple text file of g-code/m-codes , sometimes many thousands of commands long , that is then transferred to a machine tool using a direct numerical control ( dnc ) program or in modern controllers using a common usb storage device at least in the united states , there is a shortage of young , skilled machinists entering the workforce able to perform at the extremes of manufacturing ; high precision and mass production as cam software and machines become more complicated , the skills required of a machinist or machine operator advance to approach that of a computer programmer and engineer rather than eliminating the cnc machinist from the workforce this is occurring primarily in three arenas : ease of usage manufacturing complexity integration with plm and the extended enterprise ; ease in use : for the user who is just getting started as a cam user , out-of-the-box capabilities providing process wizards , templates , libraries , machine tool kits , automated feature based machining and job function specific tailorable user interfaces build user confidence and speed the learning curve the need for cam and plm tools by the manufacturing engineer , nc programmer or machinist is similar to the need for computer assistance by the pilot of modern aircraft systems ; roughing : this process usually begins with raw stock , known as billet , or a rough casting which a cnc machine cuts roughly to shape of the final model , ignoring the fine details the semi-finishing pass must leave a small amount of material ( called the scallop ) so the tool can cut accurately , but not so little that the tool and material deflect away from the cutting surfaces instead of stepping down in fine-grained increments to approximate a surface , the work piece is rotated to make the cutting surfaces of the tool tangent to the ideal part features this process is commonly used to machine complex organic shapes such as turbine and impeller blades , which due to their complex curves and overlapping geometry , are impossible to machine with only three axis machines
