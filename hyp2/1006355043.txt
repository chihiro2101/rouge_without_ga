he had a tremendous influence on the coke children : from bozoun coke learnt to '' loathe concealers , prefer godly men and briskly do business with any willing client '' , something that shaped his future conduct as a lawyer , politician , and judge the education there was based on erudition , the eventual goal being that by the age of 18 the students would have learned '' to vary one sentence diversely , to make a verse exactly , to endight an epistle eloquently and learnedly , to declaim of a theme simple , and last of all to attain some competent knowledge of the greek tongue '' this was to learn the basics of the law – the inns of chancery , including clifford 's inn , provided initial legal education before transfer to the inns of court , where one could be called to the bar and practise as a barrister after six years at the inner temple he was called to the bar on 20 april 1578 , a remarkably fast rate of progress given the process of legal education at the time , which normally required eight years of study his first case was in the court of king 's bench in 1581 , and was known as lord cromwell 's case after the claimant , lord henry cromwell , a landlord in coke 's home county of norfolk his lectures were on the statute of uses , and his reputation was such that when he retired to his house after an outbreak of the plague , '' nine benchers , forty barristers , and others of the inn accompanied him a considerable distance on his journey '' in order to talk to him coke 's uncle thomas gawdy had served as steward to the third duke of norfolk , and during the 1580s coke was employed by the howards to counter lawyers employed by the crown , who argued that the howards ' lands were forfeit owing to the treason of the 4th duke as well as defeating these direct attacks coke traveled to cardiff to answer a challenge by francis dacre , son of william dacre , 3rd baron dacre and uncle-in-law to the 4th duke 's three sons , philip howard and his two half-brothers , thomas howard , 1st earl of suffolk and lord william howard & nbsp ; – he proved that dacre 's evidence was false and had the case dismissed coke became involved in the now classic shelley 's case in 1581 , which created a rule in real property that is still used in some common law jurisdictions today ; the case also established coke 's reputation as an attorney and case reporter his next famous case was chudleigh 's case , a dispute over the interpretation of the statute of uses , followed by slade 's case , a dispute between the common pleas and king 's bench over assumpsit now regarded as a classic example of the friction between the two courts and the forward movement of contract law ; coke 's argument in slade 's case formed the first definition of consideration coke held the position only briefly ; by the time he returned from a tour of norfolk to discuss election strategy , he had been confirmed as speaker of the house of commons by the privy council , having been proposed by francis knollys and thomas heneage following his return to parliament as mp for norfolk after '' disabling '' himself in the house of lords ( a ceremony in which the incoming speaker apologised for his failings ) parliament was suspended until 24 february ; coke returned two days later , having suffered from a stomach problem the parliament was intended to be a brief and simple one ; with the black death resurgent throughout england and the threat of spain on the horizon , the only matter was to impose certain taxes to fund the queen 's campaign against the spanish , with no bills to be introduced coke , as speaker of the house of commons ( whose job was to schedule any bills ) , conducted a delaying campaign , first suggesting that the bill was too long to be read in the morning and then that it be delegated to a committee ; both suggestions were voted down by the commons coke reacted by becoming even more dogmatic in his actions on behalf of the crown , and when devereux approached the queen on bacon 's behalf , she replied that even bacon 's uncle william cecil , 1st baron burghley lord burghley considered him the second best candidate , after coke in march 1599 devereux was sent to defeat the growing rebellion in ireland and was given command of 18,000 & nbsp ; men , but by november his army was reduced to 4,000 , the rest '' frittered away '' in exchange for '' conquering nothing '' on 5 june 1600 he faced a panel of privy councillors , judges and members of the nobility at york house , where he was charged with appointing generals without the queen 's permission , ignoring orders and negotiating '' very basely '' with the leader of the rebel forces in reaction , coke decided to bring charges of treason against devereux , saying that he had '' plotted and practised with the pope and king of spain for the deposing and selling of himself as well as the crown of england & nbsp ; his permitting underhand that treasonable book of henry iv to be printed and published ; it being plainly deciphered , not only by the matter , and by the epistle itself , for what end and for whose behalf it was made , but also the earl himself being present so often at the playing thereof , and with great applause giving countenance to it '' the first of these was the trial of sir walter raleigh ; according to cuthbert william johnson , one of coke 's biographers , '' there is , perhaps , no reported case in which the proofs against the prisoner were weaker than in this trial & nbsp ; raleigh was brought to trial on 17 november 1603 , on charges of '' conspiring to deprive the king of his government ; to alter religion ; to bring in the roman superstition ; and to procure foreign enemies to invade the kingdom '' coke 's behaviour during the trial has been repeatedly criticised ; on this weak evidence , he called raleigh a '' notorious traitor '' , '' vile viper '' and '' damnable atheist '' , perverting the law and using every slip of the tongue as a way of further showing raleigh 's guilt in 1606 coke reported the star chamber case de libellis famosis , which ruled that truth was not a defence against an accusation of seditious libel , and also held that ordinary common law courts could enforce this , a doctrine which thus outlived the star chamber after its abolition in 1642 coke 's first judicial postings came under elizabeth ; in 1585 , he was made recorder of coventry , in 1587 norwich , and in 1592 recorder of london , a position he resigned upon his appointment as solicitor general his conduct was noted by johnson as '' from the first , excellent ; ever perfectly upright and fearlessly independent '' , although the convention of the day was that the judges held their positions only at the pleasure of the monarch some assert that coke became chief justice due to his prosecutions of raleigh and the gunpowder plot conspirators , but there is no evidence to support this ; instead , it was traditional at the time that a retiring chief justice would be replaced with the attorney general coke challenged this , saying '' the king in his own person can not adjudge any case , either criminal – as treason , felony etc , or betwixt party and party ; but this ought to be determined and adjudged in some court of justice , according to the law and custom of england '' coke further stated that '' the common law protecteth the king '' , to which james replied '' the king protecteth the law , and not the law the king ! the king maketh judges and bishops his law reports , known as coke 's reports , were an archive of judgments from cases he had attended , in which he had participated or about which he had been informed after being called to the bar in 1578 he began attending court cases at westminster hall , and soon drew the attention of court officials – many early reports have notes that he was told '' by old plowden '' or '' by wray cj '' the reports have gained significant academic acclaim ; writing in the cornell law quarterly , theodore plucknett describes them as works of '' incomparable richness '' with a '' profound influence upon the literature , and indeed the substance , of english law '' john baker has described them as '' perhaps the single most influential series of named reports '' , and even francis bacon , coke 's rival , wrote in praise of them , saying '' had it not been for sir edward coke 's reports ( which though they may have errors , and some peremptory and extrajudicial resolutions more than are warranted , yet they contain infinite good decisions and rulings over of cases ) , for the law by this time had been almost like a ship without ballast ; for that the cases of modern experience are fled from those that are adjudged and ruled in former time '' the other three volumes were all published after his death , and covered 39 constitutional statutes of importance ( starting with the magna carta ) , the law relating to criminal law , and constitutional and administrative law , respectively this served as an alternative to the roman law lectures at university , which were based on latin ; according to bowen , it was '' a double vision ; the institutes as authority , the reports as illustration by actual practise '' as with the reports , coke 's institutes became a standard textbook in the united states , and was recorded in the law libraries of harvard college in 1723 and brown university in 1770 ; john jay , john adams , theophilus parsons and thomas jefferson were all influenced by it john rutledge later wrote that '' coke 's institutes seems to be almost the foundations of our law '' , while jefferson stated that '' a sounder whig never wrote more profound learning in the orthodox doctrine of british liberties '' there are also factual inaccuracies ; kenyon homfray in the ecclesiastical law journal notes that , despite being considered the supreme legal authority on the subject of consecration , which coke covered in the third volume of the institutes , he offered no legal support for his opinion and ignored those pieces of case law which rejected his interpretation this principle was justified by the idea that a judge , through his professional training , internalised what political historian and theorist alan cromartie referred to as '' an infinity of wisdom '' , something that mere politicians or laypersons could not understand due to the complexity of the law this theory – that judges were the natural arbiters of the law – is known as the '' appeal to reason '' , with '' reason '' referring not to rationality but the method and logic used by judges in upholding and striking down laws coke 's position meant that certainty of the law and intellectual beauty was the way to see if a law was just and correct , and that the system of law could eventually become sophisticated enough to be predictable hobbes felt that there was no skill unique to lawyers , and that the law could be understood not through coke 's '' reason '' ( the method used by lawyers ) , but through understanding the king 's instructions with his decision that common law courts could issue writs of prohibition against such oaths and his arguments that such oaths were contrary to the common law ( as found in his reports and institutes ) , coke '' dealt the crucial blow to the oath ex officio and to the high commission '' in the trial of roger casement for treason in 1916 , coke 's assertion that treason is defined as '' giving aide and comfort to the king 's enemies within the realme or without '' was the deciding factor in finding him guilty his work in slade 's case led to the rise of modern contract law , and his actions in the case of proclamations and the other pleadings which led to his eventual dismissal went some way towards securing judicial independence the statute of monopolies , the foundation for which was laid by coke and which was drafted by him , is considered one of the first steps towards the eventual english civil war , and also '' one of the landmarks in the transition of england 's economy from the feudal to the capitalist '' during the legal and public campaigns against the writ of assistance and stamp act 1765 , bonham 's case was given as a justification for nullifying the legislation , and in the income tax case of 1895 , joseph hodges choate used coke 's argument that a tax upon the income of property is a tax on the property itself to have the supreme court of the united states declare the wilson–gorman tariff act unconstitutional the castle doctrine originates from coke 's statement in the third institutes that '' a man 's home is his castle – for where shall he be safe if it not be in his house ? '' , which also profoundly influenced the fourth amendment to the united states constitution ; the third amendment , on the other hand , was influenced by the petition of right most early lawyers were not noted for their eloquence , with thomas elyot writing that '' they lacked elocution and pronunciation , two of the principal parts of rhetorike '' , and roger ascham saying that '' they do best when they cry loudest '' , describing a court case where an advocate was '' roaring like a bull '' in court , coke was insulting to the parties , disrespectful to the judges and '' rough , blustering , overbearing '' ; a rival once wrote to him saying '' in your pleadings you were wont to insult over misery and to inveigh bitterly at the persons , which bred you many enemies '' francis watt , writing in the juridical review , portrays this as coke 's strongest characteristic as a lawyer : that he was a man who '' having once taken up a point or become engaged in a case , believes in it with all his heart and soul , whilst all the time conscious of its weakness , as well as ready to resort to every device to bolster it up '' '' the story goes that coke requested the king 's permission to just '' add one acre more '' to his holdings , and upon approval proceeded to purchase the fine estate of castle acre priory in norfolk , one of the most expensive '' acres '' in the land
