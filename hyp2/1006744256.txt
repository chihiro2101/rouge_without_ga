on cars and trucks , several senses of the word axle occur in casual usage , referring to the shaft itself , its housing , or simply any transverse pair of wheels strictly speaking , a shaft which rotates with the wheel , being either bolted or splined in fixed relation to it , is called an axle or axle shaft this very loose definition of '' axle '' is often used in assessing toll roads or excise taxes , and is taken as a rough proxy for the overall weight-bearing capacity of a vehicle , and its potential for causing wear or damage to roadway surfaces in a live-axle suspension system , the axles serve to transmit driving torque to the wheel , as well as to maintain the position of the wheels relative to each other and to the vehicle body a straight axle is a single rigid shaft connecting a wheel on the left side of the vehicle to a wheel on the right side even when the suspension is not independent , split axles permit the use of a differential , allowing the left and right drive wheels to be driven at different speeds as the automobile turns , improving traction and extending tire life in rear-wheel drive cars and trucks , the engine turns a driveshaft ( also called a propellor shaft or tailshaft ) which transmits rotational force to a drive axle at the rear of the vehicle the drive axle may be a live axle , but modern rear wheel drive automobiles generally use a split axle with a differential in this case , one half-axle or half-shaft connects the differential with the left rear wheel , a second half-shaft does the same with the right rear wheel ; thus the two half-axles and the differential constitute the rear axle some simple vehicle designs , such as leisure go-karts , may have a single driven wheel where the drive axle is a split axle with only one of the two shafts driven by the engine , or else have both wheels connected to one shaft without a differential ( kart racing ) the axle is lowered to increase the weight capacity , or to distribute the weight of the cargo over more wheels , for example to cross a weight restricted bridge when not needed , the axle is lifted off the ground to save wear on the tires and axle , and to increase traction in the remaining wheels a full-floating axle carries the vehicle 's weight on the axle casing , not the halfshafts ; they serve only to transmit torque from the differential to the wheels in contrast , a semi-floating design carries the weight of the vehicle on the axle shaft itself ; there is a single bearing at the end of the axle housing that carries the load from the axle and that the axle rotates through to remove the semi-floating axle , one has to remove a wheel first ; if such axle breaks , the wheel is most likely to come off the vehicle a benefit of a full-floating axle is that even if an axle shaft ( used to transmit torque or power ) breaks , the wheel will not come off , preventing serious accidents .
