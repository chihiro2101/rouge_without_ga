progress always docked to the aft port of the station it was resupplying ( the aft being where the main rocket engines of the station and their tankage , for refueling by the progress , are located ) for iss missions , the progress m1 variant is used , which moves the water tanks from the propellant and refueling module to the pressurized section , and as a result is able to carry more propellant between 1 february 2003 and 26 july 2005 , they were the only spacecraft available to transport large quantities of supplies to the station , as the space shuttle fleet was grounded after the breakup of columbia at the end of sts-107 atvs can carry up to 8.85 tonnes of cargo into space , roughly three times as much as the progress , and were launched annually by ariane 5 rockets from 2011-2014 as part of esa contribution to iss upkeep a new modification of the progress spacecraft , with new tsvm-101 digital flight computer and mbits digital telemetry system , was first launched on 26 november 2008 , at 12:38 utc from the kazakhstan 's baikonur cosmodrome spaceport aboard a russian soyuz rocket the spacecraft belongs to the so-called 400 series ( grau : 11f615a60 ) , and all modifications applied to it were subsequently used in the production of new soyuz tma-01m crewed spacecraft the m2 variant would have a larger service module for larger cargo or space station modules and would have been launched on a zenit rocket as the spacecraft is bigger the propulsion module , at the rear of the spacecraft , remained unchanged from the soyuz and contains the orientation engines used for the automatic docking the first 43 flights all went to mir ; following mir 's re-entry , progress was used as the resupply vehicle for the international space station this carries the supplies for the crew such as scientific equipment , clothes , prepackaged and fresh food , and letters from home progress m2 was a planned variant , which was a proposed design for the proposed mir-2 space station , but was dropped due to financial issues progress m-27m was launched on 28 april 2015 , but communication with the vessel was lost soon after , and it was destroyed as it re-entered the atmosphere on 8 may 2015 progress spacecraft are used to resupply the international space station ( iss ) as of 2021 it uses the same space rendezvous as the soyuz , and it features solar panels for the first time the reentry module of the soyuz was replaced with an unpressurized propellant and refueling compartment with ducting along the outside of the spacecraft
