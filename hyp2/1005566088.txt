the main emphasis in carnatic music is on vocal music ; most compositions are written to be sung , and even when played on instruments , they are meant to be performed in a singing style ( known as gāyaki ) for example , all songs by tyagaraja ( who composed in telugu ) have the word tyagaraja in them , all songs by muthuswami dikshitar ( who composed in sanskrit ) have the words guruguha in them ; songs by syama sastri ( who composed in telugu ) have the words syama krishna in them ; all songs by purandaradasa ( who composed in kannada ) have the words purandara vittala ; while gopalakrishna bharathi ( who composed in tamil ) used the signature gopalakrishnan in his compositions the contemporaries tyagaraja ( 1767– 1847 ) , muthuswami dikshitar , ( 1776–1835 ) and syama sastri , ( 1762–1827 ) are regarded as the trinity of carnatic music because of the quality of syama sastri 's compositions , the varieties of compositions of muthuswami dikshitar , and tyagaraja 's prolific output in composing kritis it specifies rules for movements up ( aarohanam ) and down ( avarohanam ) , the scale of which notes should figure more and which notes should be used more sparingly , which notes may be sung with gamaka ( ornamentation ) , which phrases should be used or avoided , and so on purandara dasa ( 1484–1564 ) is referred to as the pitamaha ( the father or grandfather ) of carnatic music as he formulated the basic lessons in teaching carnatic music , and in honour of his significant contribution to carnatic music the exceptions are the drone notes , shadja and panchama ( also known as the tonic and the dominant ) , which have only one form ; and madhyama ( the subdominant ) , which has two forms this poses a special challenge for the musicians because rendering this music does not involve just playing or singing the correct musical notes ; the musicians are expected to understand what was conveyed by the composer in various languages , and sing musical phrases that act to create the effect that was intended by the composer in his/her composition nettl2005 , p189 the features and rules of the raga ( also known as the sanchaaraas of a raga ) include how each note of the raga should be stressed , the scale of the raga , and so on some of the royalty of the kingdoms of mysore and travancore were themselves noted composers and proficient in playing musical instruments , such as the veena , rudra veena , violin , ghatam , flute , mridangam , nagaswara and swarabhat theoretically , this ought to be the easiest type of improvisation , since the rules are so few , but in fact , it takes much skill to sing a pleasing , comprehensive ( in the sense of giving a '' feel for the ragam '' ) and , most importantly , original raga alapana instruments , such as the saraswati veena and/or venu flute , can be occasionally found as an accompaniment , but usually , a vocalist is supported by a violin player ( who sits on his/her left ) while there are an infinite number of sounds falling within a scale ( or raga ) in carnatic music , the number that can be distinguished by auditory perception is twenty-two ( although over the years , several of them have converged ) unlike hindustani music concerts , where an accompanying tabla player can keep beats without following the musical phrases at times , in carnatic music , the accompanists have to follow the intricacies of the composition since there are percussion elements such as eduppu in several compositions since its inception , other festivals were started in a similar manner throughout india and abroad , such as the chembai sangeetholsavam in the indian city of guruvayur , and the aradhana in the us city of cleveland in carnatic music concerts , varnams are often performed by musicians as the opening item – acting as a warm up for the musicians , gupta2006 , p68 and as a means of grabbing the attention of the audience carnatic music is based as it is today on musical concepts ( including swara , raga , and tala ) that were described in detail in several ancient works , particularly the bharata 's natya shastra and silappadhikaram by ilango adigal in contrast to hindustani music of the northern part of india , carnatic music is taught and learned through compositions , which encode many intricate musical details , also providing scope for free improvisation the sama veda , which is believed to have laid the foundation for indian classical music , consists of hymns from the rigveda , set to musical tunes which would be sung using three to seven musical notes during vedic yajnas like all art forms in indian culture , indian classical music is believed to be a divine art form which originated from the devas and devis ( hindu gods and goddesses ) , moorthy2001 , p17 and is venerated as symbolic of purandara dasa , who is known as the '' father ( pitamaha ) of carnatic music '' , formulated the system that is commonly used for the teaching of carnatic music in this , the accompaniment ( usually violin , sometimes veena ) performs along with the main performer and the percussion ( such as a mridangam ) the karnataka ganakala parishat is an annual conference of carnatic music , held in february every year , which has lectures and demonstrations in the morning , and performances in the afternoons and evenings the exceptions exist in '' light '' ragas , in which , for artistic effect , there may be two , one ascending ( in the arohanam ) and another descending ( in the avarohanam ) in carnatic music , the sampoorna ragas ( those with all seven notes in their scales ) are classified into a system called the melakarta , which groups them according to the kinds of notes that they have the disadvantage with this system was that if one wanted to learn about a kriti composed , for example , by purandara dasa , it involved the difficult task of finding a person from purandara dasa 's lineage of students there are seventy-two melakarta ragas , thirty six of whose madhyama ( subdominant ) is shuddha ( perfect fourth from the tonic ) , the remaining thirty-six of whose madhyama ( subdominant ) is prati ( an augmented fourth from the tonic ) in very long strings of swara , the performers must calculate their notes accurately to ensure that they stick to the raga , have no awkward pauses or lapses in the beat of the song , and create a complex pattern of notes that a knowledgeable audience can follow it is the approximate equivalent of a tonic ( or less precisely a key ) in western music ; it is the note from which all the others are derived owing to persian and islamic influences in north india from the 12th century onwards , indian classical music began to diverge into two distinct styles — hindustani music and carnatic music with the city of chennai ( then known as madras ) emerging as the locus for carnatic music during the 19th century , its musicians founded the tyagaraja aradhana festival in 1846 swara refers to a type of musical sound that is a single note , which defines a relative ( higher or lower ) position of a note , rather than a defined frequency the performer will explore the ragam and touch on its various nuances , singing in the lower octaves first , then gradually moving up to higher octaves , while giving a hint of the song to be performed ancient treatises also describe the connection of the origin of the swaras , or notes , to the sounds of animals and birds and man 's effort to simulate these sounds through a keen sense of observation and perception the performer must improvise a string of swaras in any octave according to the rules of the raga and return to beginning of the cycle of beats smoothly , joining the swaras with a phrase selected from the kriti with the dissolution of the erstwhile princely states and the indian independence movement reaching its conclusion in 1947 , carnatic music went through a radical shift in patronage into an art of the masses with ticketed performances organised by private institutions called sabhās prominent composers prior to the trinity of carnatic music include sripadaraja , vyasatirtha , kanakadasa , vadiraja tirtha , arunachala kavi , annamacharya , narayana teertha , vijaya dasa , jagannatha dasa , gopala dasa , bhadrachala ramadas , sadasiva brahmendra and oottukkadu venkata kavi like hindustani music , carnatic music rests on two main elements : , the modes or melodic formulæ , and , the rhythmic cycles moorthy2001 , p18 by the 16th and 17th centuries , there was a clear demarcation between carnatic and hindustani music ; carnatic music remained relatively unaffected by persian and arabic influences an alapana , sometimes also called ragam , is the exposition of a raga or tone – a slow improvisation with no rhythm , where the raga acts as the basis of embellishment the notions of key and absolute pitch are deeply rooted in western music , whereas the carnatic notation does not specify the key and prefers to use scale degrees ( relative pitch ) to denote notes though these forms consist of lyric-based verses , musicians improvise raga phrases in free rhythm , like an alapana , so both the sound value , and the meaning of the text , guide the musician through elaborate melodic improvisations this usually consists of , at least , a principal performer , a melodic accompaniment , a rhythm accompaniment , and a drone the yajnavalkya smriti mentions वीणावादन तत्त्वज्ञः श्रुतीजातिविशारदः ताळज्ञश्चाप्रयासेन मोक्षमार्गं नियच्छति ( vīṇāvādana tattvajñaḥ śrutijātiviśāradaḥ tālajñaścāprayāsena mokṣamārgaṃ niyacchati , '' the one who is well versed in veena , one who has the knowledge of srutis and one who is adept in tala , attains liberation ( moksha ) without doubt '' ) papanasam sivan , who has been hailed as the tamil tyagaraja of carnatic music , composed in tamil and sanskrit , and used the signature ramadasan in his compositions tani avartanam refers to the extended solo that is played by the percussionists in a concert , arnold2000 , 158 and is usually played after the main composition in a concert if the duration of note is to be doubled , the letter is either capitalized ( if using roman script ) or lengthened by a diacritic ( in indian languages )
