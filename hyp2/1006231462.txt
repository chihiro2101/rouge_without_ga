as to the actual identity of the builders of great zimbabwe , de barros writes : additionally , with regard to the purpose of the great zimbabwe ruins , de barros asserted that : '' in the opinion of the moors who saw it great zimbabwe it is very ancient and was built to keep possessions of the mines , which are very old , and no gold has been extracted from them for years , because of the wars the mutapa state arose in the fifteenth century from the northward expansion of the great zimbabwe tradition , having been founded by nyatsimba mutota from great zimbabwe after he was sent to find new sources of salt in the north ; ( this supports the belief that great zimbabwe 's decline was due to a shortage of resources ) in 1506 , the explorer diogo de alcáçova described the edifices in a letter to the then king of portugal , writing that they were part of the larger kingdom of ucalanga ( presumably karanga , a dialect of the shona people spoken mainly in masvingo and midlands provinces of zimbabwe ) another source of damage to the ruins has been due to the site being open to visitors with many cases of people climbing the walls , walking over archaeological deposits , and the over-use of certain paths all have had major impacts on the structures at the site garlake ( 2002 ) 24 according to paul sinclair , interviewed for none but ourselves : this suppression of archaeology culminated in the departure from the country of prominent archaeologists of great zimbabwe , including peter garlake , senior inspector of monuments for rhodesia , and roger summers of the national museum flinders petrie examined it and identified a cartouche on its chest as belonging to the 18th dynasty egyptian pharaoh thutmose iii and suggested that it was a statuette of the king and cited it as proof of commercial ties between rulers in the area and the ancient egyptians during the new kingdom ( c jpg the conical tower file : zimbabwe wall.jpg the great enclosure file : wall of the great enclosure , great zimbabwe.jpg the great enclosure ( close ) file : wall of the great enclosure ( far ) , great zimbabwe.jpg the great enclosure ( far ) file : great-zimbabwe-3.jpg the hill complex from the valley file : zimbabwe stone lintel.jpg wooden lintel in doorway isichei , elizabeth allo , a history of african societies to 1870 cambridge university press , 1997 , page 435 gokomere peoples were probably also related to certain nearby early bantu groups like the mapungubwe civilisation of neighbouring north eastern south africa , which is believed to have been an early venda-speaking culture , and to the nearby sotho in 1980 the new internationally recognised independent country was renamed for the site , and its famous zimbabwe bird were retained from the rhodesian flag and coat of arms as a national symbol and depicted in the new zimbabwean flag the ruins were rediscovered during a hunting trip in 1867 by adam render , a german-american hunter , prospector and trader in southern africa , who in 1871 showed the ruins to karl mauch , a german explorer and geographer of africa notable features of the hill complex include the eastern enclosure , in which it is thought the zimbabwe birds stood , a high balcony enclosure overlooking the eastern enclosure , and a huge boulder in a shape similar to that of the zimbabwe bird zimbabwe is the shona name of the ruins , first recorded in 1531 by vicente pegado , captain of the portuguese garrison of sofala david beach believes that the city and its state , the kingdom of zimbabwe , flourished from 1200 to 1500 , although a somewhat earlier date for its demise is implied by a description transmitted in the early 1500s to joão de barros the first european visit may have been made by the portuguese traveler antónio fernandes in 1513-1515 , who crossed twice and reported in detail the region of present-day zimbabwe ( including the shona kingdoms ) and also fortified centers in stone without mortar the first proposes that the word is derived from , translated from the karanga dialect of shona as '' large houses of stone '' plural of , '' house '' ; plural of , '' stone '' ) causes for the decline and ultimate abandonment of the site around 1450 have been suggested as due to a decline in trade compared to sites further north , the exhaustion of the gold mines , political instability and famine and water shortages induced by climatic change garlake ( 2002 ) 158 slots in a platform in the eastern enclosure of the hill complex appear designed to hold the monoliths with the zimbabwe birds , but as they were not found in situ it can not be determined which monolith and bird were where thumb martin hall writes that the history of iron age research south of the zambezi shows the prevalent influence of colonial ideologies , both in the earliest speculations about the nature of the african past and in the adaptations that have been made to contemporary archaeological methodologies its most formidable edifice , commonly referred to as the great enclosure , has walls as high as extending approximately , making it the largest ancient structure south of the sahara desert garlake ( 1973 ) 119 other artefacts include soapstone figurines ( one of which is in the british museum ) , pottery , iron gongs , elaborately worked ivory , iron and copper wire , iron hoes , bronze spearheads , copper ingots and crucibles , and gold beads , bracelets , pendants and sheaths at first it was argued that it represented a form of pre-colonial '' african socialism '' and later the focus shifted to stressing the natural evolution of an accumulation of wealth and power within a ruling elite 738 portuguese traders heard about the remains of the ancient city in the early 16th century , and records survive of interviews and notes made by some of them , linking great zimbabwe to gold production and long-distance trade artefacts and radiocarbon dating indicate settlement in at least the fifth century , with continuous settlement of great zimbabwe between the twelfth and fifteenth centuries garlake ( 2002 ) 146 and the bulk of the finds from the fifteenth century bent stated in the first edition of his book the ruined cities of mashonaland ( 1892 ) that the ruins revealed either the phoenicians or the arabs as builders , and he favoured the possibility of great antiquity for the fortress the radiocarbon evidence is a suite of 28 measurements , for which all but the first four , from the early days of the use of that method and now viewed as inaccurate , support the twelfth to fifteenth centuries chronology the ruins at great zimbabwe are some of the oldest and largest structures located in southern africa , and are the second oldest after nearby mapungubwe in south africa the alternative '' structuralist '' interpretation holds that the different complexes had different functions : the hill complex as a temple , the valley complex was for the citizens , and the great enclosure was used by the king it would seem that some prince who has possession of these mines ordered it to be built as a sign thereof , which he afterwards lost in the course of time and through their being so remote from his kingdom karl mauch recorded the ruins 3 september 1871 , and immediately speculated about a possible biblical association with king solomon and the queen of sheba , an explanation which had been suggested by earlier writers such as the portuguese joão dos santos mauch went so far as to favour a legend that the structures were built to replicate the palace of the queen of sheba in jerusalem , and claimed a wooden lintel at the site must be cedrus libani , brought by phoenicians the focus of power moved from the hill complex in the twelfth century , to the great enclosure , the upper valley and finally the lower valley in the early sixteenth century by the third edition of his book ( 1902 ) he was more specific , with his primary theory being '' a semitic race and of arabian origin '' of '' strongly commercial '' traders living within a client african city summers ( 1970 ) p35 the gokomere culture likely gave rise to both the modern mashona people , an ethnic cluster comprising distinct sub-ethnic groups such as the local karanga clan and the rozwi culture , which originated as several shona states examples of such popular history include alexander wilmot 's monomotapa ( rhodesia ) and ken mufuka 's dzimbahwe : life and politics in the golden age ;
