a slightly different framework for natural history , covering a similar range of themes , is also implied in the scope of work encompassed by many leading natural history museums , which often include elements of anthropology , geology , paleontology , and astronomy along with botany and zoology , american museum of natural history , mission statement field museum , mission statement or include both cultural and natural components of the world examples of these societies in britain include the natural history society of northumbria founded in 1829 , london natural history society ( 1858 ) , birmingham natural history society ( 1859 ) , british entomological and natural history society founded in 1872 , glasgow natural history society , manchester microscopical and natural history society established in 1880 , whitby naturalists ' club founded in 1913 , scarborough field naturalists ' society and the sorby natural history society , sheffield , founded in 1918 in antiquity , '' natural history '' covered essentially anything connected with nature , or used materials drawn from nature , such as pliny the elder 's natural history ( pliny ) , published circa 77 to 79 ad , which covers astronomy , geography , humans and their technology , medicine , and superstition , as well as animals and plants for example , while natural history is most often defined as a type of observation and a subject of study , it can also be defined as a body of knowledge , and as a craft or a practice , in which the emphasis is placed more on the observer than on the observed three of the greatest english naturalists of the 19th century , henry walter bates , charles darwin , and alfred russel wallace—who all knew each other—each made natural history travels that took years , collected thousands of specimens , many of them new to science , and by their writings both advanced knowledge of '' remote '' parts of the world—the amazon basin , the galápagos islands , and the malay archipelago , among others—and in so doing helped to transform biology from a descriptive to a theory-based science i like to think , then , of natural history as the study of life at the level of the individual—of what plants and animals do , how they react to each other and their environment , how they are organized into larger groupings like populations and communities '' marston bates , the nature of natural history , scribners , 1954 from the ancient greeks until the work of carl linnaeus and other 18th-century naturalists , a major concept of natural history was the scala naturae or great chain of being , an arrangement of minerals , vegetables , more primitive forms of animals , and more complex life forms on a linear scale of supposedly increasing perfection , culminating in our species the term '' natural history '' alone , or sometimes together with archaeology , forms the name of many national , regional , and local natural history societies that maintain records for animals ( including birds ( ornithology ) , insects ( entomology ) and mammals ( mammalogy ) ) , fungi ( mycology ) , plants ( botany ) , and other organisms still , the traditions of natural history continue to play a part in the study of biology , especially ecology ( the study of natural systems involving living organisms and the inorganic components of the earth 's biosphere that support them ) , ethology ( the scientific study of animal behavior ) , and evolutionary biology ( the study of the relationships between life forms over very long periods of time ) , and re-emerges today as integrative organismal biology the study of nature revived in the renaissance , and quickly became a third branch of academic knowledge , itself divided into descriptive natural history and natural philosophy , the analytical study of nature definitions from biologists often focus on the scientific study of individual organisms in their environment , as seen in this definition by marston bates : '' natural history is the study of animals and plants—of organisms bartholomew , '' the role of natural history in contemporary biology '' , bioscience 36 ( 1986 ) : 324–329 a common thread in many definitions of natural history is the inclusion of a descriptive component , as seen in a recent definition by h.w amateur collectors and natural history entrepreneurs played an important role in building the world 's large natural history collections , such as the natural history museum , london , and the national museum of natural history in washington , dc because organisms are functionally inseparable from the environment in which they live and because their structure and function can not be adequately interpreted without knowing some of their evolutionary history , the study of natural history embraces the study of fossils as well as physiographic and other aspects of the physical environment '' modern definitions of natural history come from a variety of fields and sources , and many of the modern definitions emphasize a particular aspect of the field , creating a plurality of definitions with a number of common themes among them the meaning of the english term '' natural history '' ( a calque of the latin historia naturalis ) has narrowed progressively with time , while , by contrast , the meaning of the related term '' nature '' has widened ( see also history below ) the natural history museum , mission statement the plurality of definitions for this field has been recognized as both a weakness and a strength , and a range of definitions has recently been offered by practitioners in a recent collection of views on natural history
