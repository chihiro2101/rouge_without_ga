in 1740 , ireland had a population of 2.4 million people , most of whom depended on grains ( oats , wheat , barley and rye ) and potatoes as their staple foods an extraordinary climatic shock , known as the '' great frost '' , struck ireland and the rest of europe between december 1739 and september 1741 following a decade of relatively mild winters this kind of weather was '' quite outside the irish experience , '' notes david dickson , author of arctic ireland : the extraordinary story of the great frost and forgotten famine of 1740–41 people who lived in the country were probably better off than city-dwellers , because , in ireland , country people had cabins sheltered by sod stacks , while the latter , especially the poor , dwelt in freezing basements and garrets thumb the municipal leaders ( mostly protestant merchants and members of the landed gentry ) , however , paid closer attention to the state of urban and rural artisans and tradespeople because of their contributions to the commercial economy on which the landowners depended this action was in response to cork corporation ( city of cork ) , which remembered vividly the city events of eleven years earlier when serious food riots erupted and four people died in celbridge , county kildare , katherine , the widow of william conolly , commissioned the construction of the conolly folly in 1740 to give employment to local workers the great frost affected the potato , which was one of the two main staples ( the other was oatmeal ) in rural ireland '' richard purcell , one of the best rural witnesses of the unfolding crisis , reported in late february 1740 that had the frost not occurred , there would have been enough potatoes in his district to have kept the country ireland fed until august 1740 , indicating a rare local abundance of the crop 'but both root and branch…is destroyed every where ' , except for ' a few which happen 'd to be housed ' , and 'in a very few deep…and turfy moulded gardens where some , perhaps enough for seed for the same ground , are sound by the end of april , it destroyed much of the tillage crops ( wheat and barley ) sown the previous autumn , and grains were more important in the diet than were potatoes the important corn crop also failed , which resulted in greater mortality in ireland than in britain or the continent the potato crisis caused an increase in grain prices , resulting in smaller and smaller loaves of bread for the old price dickson explains that the '' wholesale rise in the price of wheat , oats and barley reflected not just the current supply position , but the dealers ' assessment as to the state of things later in the year 25 by summer 1740 , the frost had decimated the potatoes , and the drought had decimated the grain harvest and herds of cattle and sheep with the soaring cost of food , hungry townspeople '' vented their frustration on grain dealers , meal-mongers and bakers , and when they turned to direct action the most likely flashpoints were markets or warehouses '' where food owners stored bulk food but in the dairying districts , cows had been so weak after the frost that at least a third of them had failed to '' take bull , '' or become impregnated at breeding this resulted in fewer calves , a shortage of milk , which was widely consumed , and a decline in butter production the lord mayor of dublin , samuel cooke , consulted with the lords justices – archbishop boulter ; henry boyle , 1st earl of shannon ; and lord jocelyn , the lord chancellor of ireland – on 15 december 1740 to figure out a way to bring down the price of corn in drogheda , the chief justice of the irish common pleas , henry singleton , a citizen of the town , donated much of his private fortune for famine relief the normal death rate tripled in january and february 1740 , and burials averaged out about 50 % higher during the twenty-one-month crisis than for the years 1737–1739 , according to dickson 97–98 that famine , however , was unique in '' cause , scale and timing , '' persisting over several years as conditions eased , '' the population entered into a period of unprecedented growth , '' although additional famines occurred during the eighteenth century 127 dickson notes that an upsurge in migration out of ireland in the years after the 1740–1741 crisis did not take place , perhaps in part because conditions improved relatively quickly although the most likely primary reason was that a transoceanic voyage was far beyond the means of most of the population at this time 16–31 the year 1741 , during which the famine was at its worst and mortality was greatest , was known in folk memory as the '' year of the slaughter '' ( or bliain an áir in irish ) ) , famine : the irish experience , edinburgh : john donald , 1989 david dickson , arctic ireland ( white row press , dublin 1997 ) 2762 , john scott , cork to thomas dillon & co , 25 jan 1739–40 : “ an express from corke , with an account of a blood battle fought between the mob of that city and the standing army… ( dublin , 1729 ) ( 2012 ) , scurvy in the great irish famine : evidence of vitamin c deficiency from a mid-19th century skeletal population doi:10.1002/ajpa.22066 joe lee , the modernisation of irish society eamonn o ciardha : ireland and the jacobite cause , 1685–1766 : a fatal attachment , four courts press , dublin , 2002
