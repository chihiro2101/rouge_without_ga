1847 he is reputed to have been offered a knighthood on queen victoria 's 1847 cambridge visit but to have declined , either out of modesty , or fear of the financial consequences of such social distinction ; 1847 foreign honorary member of the american academy of arts and sciences ; 1848 copley medal of the royal society ; 1848 adams prize , founded by the members of st john 's college , to be given biennially for the best treatise on a mathematical subject ; 1849 elected fellow of the royal society of london and honorary fellow of the royal society of edinburgh ; 1851 and 1874 president of the royal astronomical society ( 1851–1853 and 1874–1876 ) a catalogue of the portsmouth collection of books and papers written by or belonging to sir isaac newton , the scientific part of which has been presented by the earl of portsmouth to the university of cambridge , drawn up by the syndicate appointed 6 november 1982 , cambridge : cambridge university press , 1888 the post of astronomer royal was offered him in 1881 , but he preferred to pursue his teaching and research in cambridge p56 : london ;

adams nunatak , a nunatak on neptune glacier in alexander island in antarctica , is named after him but it is also notable ( and not included in some of the foregoing discussion references ) that adams himself publicly acknowledged le verrier 's priority and credit ( not forgetting to mention the role of galle ) in the paper that he gave 'on the perturbations of uranus ' to the royal astronomical society in november 1846 : adams held no bitterness towards challis or airy and acknowledged his own failure to convince the astronomical world : sampson ( 1900 ) lectures on the lunar theory , london : cambridge university press a collection , virtually complete , of adams 's papers regarding the discovery of neptune was presented by mrs adams to the library of st john 's college , see : sampson ( 1904 ) , and also : '' the collected papers of prof would please to observe , with due care , the phases of the moon 's eclipses at bagdat , aleppo and alexandria , thereby to determine their longitudes , they could not do the science of astronomy a greater service : for in and near these places were made all the observations by which the mean motions of the sun and moon are limited : and i could then pronounce in what proportion the moon 's motion does accelerate ; which that it does , i think i can demonstrate he was british delegate to the international meridian conference at washington in 1884 , when he also attended the meetings of the british association at montreal and of the american association at philadelphia adams believed , in the face of anything that had been attempted before , that he could use the observed data on uranus , and utilising nothing more than newton 's law of gravitation , deduce the mass , position and orbit of the perturbing body in 1858 adams became professor of mathematics at the university of st andrews , but lectured only for a session , before returning to cambridge for the lowndean professorship of astronomy and geometry after a long illness , adams died at cambridge on 21 january 1892 and was buried near his home in st giles cemetery , now the parish of the ascension burial ground in cambridge in 1820 , at the insistence of the académie des sciences , damoiseau , plana and francesco carlini revisited laplace 's work , investigating quadratic and higher-order perturbing terms , and obtained similar results , again addressing only a radial , and neglecting tangential , gravitational force on the moon using a powerful and elaborate analysis , adams ascertained that this cluster of meteors , which belongs to the solar system , traverses an elongated ellipse in 33.25 years , and is subject to definite perturbations from the larger planets , jupiter , saturn , and uranus in 1836 , his mother inherited a small estate at badharlick and his promise as a mathematician induced his parents to send him to the university of cambridge apparently , adams communicated his work to james challis , director of the cambridge observatory , in mid-september 1845 , but there is some controversy as to how only after the discovery of neptune on 23 september 1846 had been announced in paris did it become apparent that neptune had been observed on 8 and 12 august but because challis lacked an up-to-date star-map it was not recognized as a planet adams '' , journal of the british astronomical association , 7 ( 1896–97 ) monthly notices of the royal astronomical society , 53 184 ;
