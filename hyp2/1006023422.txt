during the first half of the 20th century , photographic observations of nearby galaxies detected some characteristic signatures of agn emission , although there was not yet a physical understanding of the nature of the agn phenomenon some early observations included the first spectroscopic detection of spectral line from the nuclei of ngc 1068 and messier 81 by edward fath ( published in 1909 ) , and the discovery of the jet in messier 87 by heber curtis ( published in 1918 ) in photographic images , some of these objects were nearly point-like or quasi-stellar in appearance , and were classified as quasar ( later abbreviated as '' quasars '' ) schmidt noted that if this object was extragalactic ( outside the milky way , at a cosmological distance ) then its large redshift of 0.158 implied that it was the nuclear region of a galaxy about 100 times more powerful than other radio galaxies that had been identified in 1969 donald lynden-bell proposed that nearby galaxies contain supermassive black holes at their centers as relics of '' dead '' quasars , and that black hole accretion was the power source for the non-stellar emission in nearby seyfert galaxies in the 1960s and 1970s , early x-ray astronomy observations demonstrated that seyfert galaxies and quasars are powerful sources of x-ray emission , which originates from the inner regions of black hole accretion disks agn research encompasses observational surveys to find agn over broad ranges of luminosity and redshift , examination of the cosmic evolution and growth of black holes , studies of the physics of black hole accretion and the emission of electromagnetic radiation from agn , examination of the properties of jets and outflows of matter from agn , and the impact of black hole accretion and quasar activity on galaxy evolution for a long time it has been argued that an agn must be powered by accretion of mass onto massive black holes ( 10 6 to 10 10 times the solar mass ) accretion can potentially give very efficient conversion of potential and kinetic energy to radiation , and a massive black hole has a high eddington luminosity , and as a result , it can provide the observed high persistent luminosity supermassive black holes are now believed to exist in the centres of most if not all massive galaxies since the mass of the black hole correlates well with the velocity dispersion of the galactic bulge ( the m–sigma relation ) or with bulge luminosity the expected spectrum of an accretion disc peaks in the optical-ultraviolet waveband ; in addition , a corona of hot material forms above the accretion disc and can compton scattering photons up to x-ray energies a large fraction of the agn 's radiation may be obscured by interstellar gas and dust close to the accretion disc , but ( in a steady-state situation ) this will be re-radiated at some other waveband , most likely the infrared the jets have their most obvious observational effects in the radio waveband , where very-long-baseline interferometry can be used to study the synchrotron radiation they emit at resolutions of sub-parsec scales however , they radiate in all wavebands from the radio through to the gamma-ray range via the synchrotron and the compton scattering process , and so agn jets are a second potential source of any observed continuum radiation in this type of accretion , which is important for accretion rates well below the eddington limit , the accreting matter does not form a thin disc and consequently does not efficiently radiate away the energy that it acquired as it moved close to the black hole this is a result of illumination of cold heavy elements by the x-ray continuum that causes fluorescence of x-ray emission lines , the best-known of which is the iron feature around 6.4 kev this line may be narrow or broad : broad iron k line can be used to study the dynamics of the accretion disc very close to the nucleus and therefore the nature of the central black hole there is a correlation between the quasar 's luminosity and the mass of its host galaxy , in that the most luminous quasars inhabit the most massive galaxies ( ellipticals ) in seyfert 2s the nucleus is observed through an obscuring structure which prevents a direct view of the optical continuum , broad-line region or ( soft ) x-ray emission outside the torus there is material that can scatter some of the nuclear emission into our line of sight , allowing us to see some optical and x-ray continuum and , in some cases , broad emission lines—which are strongly polarized , showing that they have been scattered and proving that some seyfert 2s really do contain hidden seyfert 1s these can be unified with narrow-line radio galaxies in a manner directly analogous to the seyfert 1/2 unification ( but without the complication of much in the way of a reflection component : narrow-line radio galaxies show no nuclear optical continuum or reflected x-ray component , although they do occasionally show polarized broad-line emission ) x-ray evidence , where available , supports the unified picture : radio galaxies show evidence of obscuration from a torus , while quasars do not , although care must be taken since radio-loud objects also have a soft unabsorbed jet-related component , and high resolution is necessary to separate out thermal emission from the sources ' large-scale hot-gas environment these do not show strong nuclear emission lines—broad or narrow—they have optical continua which appear to be entirely jet-related , and their x-ray emission is also consistent with coming purely from a jet , with no heavily absorbed nuclear component in general these objects can not be unified with quasars , even though they include some high-luminosity objects when looking at radio emission , since the torus can never hide the narrow-line region to the required extent , and since infrared studies show that they have no hidden nuclear component : in fact there is no evidence for a torus in these objects at all in the recent literature on agn , being subject to an intense debate , an increasing set of observations appear to be in conflict with some of the key predictions of the unified model , e.g therefore , one can not know whether the gas in all seyfert 2 galaxies is ionized due to photoionization from a single , non-stellar continuum source in the center or due to shock-ionization from e.g the models also suggest an accretion-rate dependence of the broad-line region and provide a natural evolution from more active engines in seyfert 1s to more “ dead ” seyfert 2s and can explain the observed break-down of the unified model at low luminosities and the evolution of the broad-line region today , having overcome the previous limitations of small sample sizes and anisotropic selection , studies of neighbours of hundreds to thousands of agn have shown that the neighbours of seyfert 2s are intrinsically dustier and more star-forming than seyfert 1s and a connection between agn type , host galaxy morphology and collision history understanding whether it is the same engine driving all seyfert 2s , the connection to radio-loud agn , the mechanisms of the variability of some agn that vary between the two types at very short time scales , and the connection of the agn type to small- and large-scale environment remain important issues to incorporate into any unified model of active galactic nuclei for a long time , active galaxies held all the records for the highest-redshift objects known either in the optical or the radio spectrum , because of their high luminosity they still have a role to play in studies of the early universe , but it is now recognised that an agn gives a highly biased picture of the '' typical '' high-redshift galaxy this suggests that massive black holes formed early on and that the conditions for the formation of luminous agn were more common in the early universe , such as a much higher availability of cold gas near the centre of galaxies than at present
