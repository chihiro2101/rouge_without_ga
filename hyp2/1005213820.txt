differential heat treatment is a method used to alter the properties of various parts of a steel object differently , producing areas that are harder or softer than others this creates greater toughness in the parts of the object where it is needed , such as the tang or spine of a sword , but produces greater hardness at the edge or other areas where greater impact resistance , wear resistance , and strength is needed there are several techniques used to differentially heat treat steel , but they can usually be divided into differential hardening and differential tempering methods quenched-steel is usually heated again , slowly and evenly ( usually between and in a process called tempering , to soften the metal , thereby increasing the toughness it can also be achieved by carefully pouring water ( perhaps already heated ) onto the edge of a blade as is the case with the manufacture of some kukri with flame hardening and induction hardening techniques , the steel is quickly heated to red-hot in a localized area and then quenched differential tempering is obtained by quenching the sword uniformly , then tempering one part of it , such as the spine or the center portion of double edged blades differential hardening ( also called differential quenching , selective quenching , selective hardening , or local hardening ) is most commonly used in bladesmithing to increase the toughness of a blade while keeping very high hardness and strength at the edge when it is heated to red-hot and quenched , the edge cools quickly , becoming very hard , but the rest cools slowly , becoming much softer this allows the edge to cool very quickly , turning it into a very hard microstructure called martensite , but causes the rest of the blade to cool slowly , turning it into a soft microstructure called pearlite the edge , however , will usually be too hard , so after quenching the entire blade is usually tempered to around for a short time , to bring the hardness of the edge down to around hrc60 on the rockwell hardness scale by controlling the thickness of the edge-coating along with the temperature of the water , the cooling rate of each part of the blade can be controlled to produce the proper hardness upon quenching without the need for further tempering after the blade is heated to the proper temperature , which is usually judged by the cherry-red glow ( blackbody radiation ) of the blade , it will change into a phase called austenite both to help prevent cracking and to produce uniformity in the hardness of each area , the smith will need to ensure that the temperature is even , lacking any hot spots from sitting next to the coals care must be taken to plunge the sword quickly and vertically ( edge first ) , for if one side enters the quenching fluid before the other the cooling may be asymmetric and cause the blade to bend sideways ( warp ) the hardened portion of the blade ( yakiba ) and the center portion ( hira ) are often given a matte finish instead , to make the differences in the hardness stand out in japan , from the legendary time of the famous smith amakuni , hamons were originally straight and parallel to the edge , but by the twelfth century ad , smiths such as shintogo kunimitsu began producing hamons with very irregular shapes , which provided both mechanical and decorative benefits by the eighteenth century , decorative hamons were often being combined with decorative folding techniques to produce entire landscapes , complete with specific islands , crashing waves , hills , mountains , rivers , and sometimes low spots were cut in the clay to produce niye far away from the hamon , creating effects such as birds in the sky although differential hardening produces a very hard edge , it also leaves the rest of the sword rather soft , which can make it prone to bending under heavy loads , such as parrying a hard blow flame hardening is often used to harden only a portion of an object , by quickly heating it with a very hot flame in a localized area , and then quenching the steel the gear will usually be quenched and tempered to a specific hardness first , making a majority of the gear tough , and then the teeth are quickly heated and immediately quenched , hardening only the surface when edge turns the proper color temperature , it is quenched , hardening only the edge , but leaving most of the rest of the blade at the lower hardness when combined with the stresses formed , this creates a very brittle zone between the hard and softer metal , which usually makes this method unsuitable for swords or tools that may be subjected to shear and impact stresses with induction heating , the steel can be heated very quickly to red-hot at the surface , before the heat can penetrate any distance into the metal the most common use for differential tempering was for heat treating cutting tools , such as axes and chisels , where an extremely hard edge is desired , but some malleability and springiness is needed in the rest of the tool the steel is then heated in a localized area , such as the hammering-end of a chisel or the handle-end of an axe as the steel is heated , these colors will form , ranging from yellow to brown , purple , and blue , and many shades in between , and will indicate the temperature of the steel as heat is applied , the colors will form near the heat source , and then slowly move across the tool , following the heat as it conducts toward the edge unlike with differential hardening , in differential tempering there is no distinct boundary between the harder and softer metals , but the change from hard to soft is very gradual , forming a continuum , or '' grade '' ( gradient ) , of hardness however , higher heating temperatures cause the colors to spread less , creating a much steeper grade , while lower temperatures can make the change more gradual , using a smaller portion of the entire continuum the tempering colors only represent a fraction of the entire grade , because the metal turns grey above , making it difficult to judge the temperature , but the hardness will continue to decrease as the temperature rises however , with double-edged blades , the heat source will usually need to be more precisely localized because the heat must be applied evenly along the center of the blade , allowing it to conduct to both edges the smith may need to control the temperature by using methods like pouring water along certain parts of the edge , or cooling it with ice , causing the proper temperature to reach the entire edge at the same time when a sword , knife or tool is evenly quenched , the entire object turns into martensite , which is extremely hard , without the formation of soft pearlite tempering reduces the hardness in the steel by gradually changing the martensite into a microstructure of various carbides , such as cementite , and softer ferrite ( iron ) , forming a microstructure called '' tempered martensite '' when tempering high-carbon steel in the blacksmith method , the color provides a general indication of the final hardness , although some trial-and-error is usually required to match the right color to the type of steel to achieve the exact hardness , because the carbon content , the heating speed , and even the type of heat source will affect the outcome this may leave very little difference between the edge and the center , and the benefits of this method , over tempering the sword evenly at a point somewhere in the middle , may not be very substantial
