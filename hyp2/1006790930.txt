to say that p is necessary and sufficient for q is to say two things : that p is necessary for q , p \leftarrow q , and that p is sufficient for q , p \rightarrow q we can write p \leftrightarrow q \equiv q \leftrightarrow p and say that the statements '' p is true if and only if q , is true '' and '' q is true if and only if p is true '' are equivalent secondly , the opposite is proven , q \rightarrow p either directly , assuming q is true and demonstrating that the q circle is located within p , or contrapositively , that is demonstrating that stepping outside circle of p , we fall out the q : assuming not p , not q results for a third facet , identify every mathematical predicate n with the set t ( n ) of objects , events , or statements for which n holds true ; then asserting the necessity of n for s is equivalent to claiming that t ( n ) is a superset of t ( s ) , while asserting the sufficiency of s for n is equivalent to claiming that t ( s ) is a subset of t ( n ) the assertion that q is necessary for p is colloquially equivalent to '' p can not be true unless q is true '' or '' if q is false , then p is false '' ; example 1 : for it to be true that '' john is a bachelor '' , it is necessary that it be also true that he is : unmarried , : male , : adult , : since to state '' john is a bachelor '' implies john has each of those three additional predicates if the conditional statement is true , then if s is true , n must be true ; whereas if the conditional statement is true and n is true , then s may be true or be false one may summarize any , and thus all , of these cases by the statement '' p if and only if q '' , which is denoted by p \leftrightarrow q , whereas cases tell us that p \leftrightarrow q is identical to p \rightarrow q \land q \rightarrow p if p is sufficient for q , then knowing p to be true is adequate grounds to conclude that q is true ; however , knowing p to be false does not meet a minimal need to conclude that q is false in common language , this is equivalent to saying that if the conditional statement is a true statement , then the consequent n must be true—if s is to be true ( see third column of '' truth table '' immediately below ) it may also be expressed as any of '' p only if q '' , '' q , if p '' , '' q whenever p '' , and '' q when p '' for instance , being a mammal ( n ) is necessary but not sufficient to being human ( s ) , and that a number x is rational ( s ) is sufficient but not necessary to x being a real number ( n ) ( since there are real numbers that are not rational ) equivalently , it may be understood to say that p and q is necessary for the other , p \rightarrow q \land q \rightarrow p , which can also be stated as each is sufficient for or implies the other p \leftarrow q is equivalent to q \rightarrow p , if p is necessary and sufficient for q , then q is necessary and sufficient for p the logical relation between p and q is expressed as '' if p , then q '' and denoted '' p ⇒ q '' ( p implies q ) for example , at present , '' today is the fourth of july '' is a necessary and sufficient condition for '' today is independence day in the united states '' this conditional statement may be written in several equivalent ways , such as '' n if s '' , '' s only if n '' , '' s implies n '' , '' n is implied by s '' , , and '' n whenever s ''
