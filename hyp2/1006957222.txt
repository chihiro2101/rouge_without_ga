search on dove 's guide for towers with 13 or more bells , note that christ church cathedral , dublin is listed as having 16 bells , with additional sharp 6 , 9 and 13 ; swan bells , perth , western australia , is again a 16 but with additional flat 3 and 10 when stationary in the down position , the centre of mass of the bell and clapper is appreciably below the centreline of the trunnion supports , giving a pendulum effect to the assembly , and this dynamic is controlled by the ringer 's rope below the bell chamber there may be one or more sound chambers , ( one of which is likely to house the clock mechanism if the church has one ) and through which the rope passes before it drops into the ringing chamber or room a bell that is up is dangerous to be near , and only expert ringers should ever contemplate entering a bell chamber or touching a rope when the bells are up to ring the bell , the ringer first pulls the sally towards the floor , upsetting the bell 's balance and swinging it on its bearings the bell winds the rope back onto the other side of the wheel as it rises and the ringer can slow ( or check ) the rise of the bell if required the rope is attached to one side of the wheel so that a different amount of rope is wound on and off as it swings to and fro the ringer pulls on the sally and when the bell swings up it draws up more rope onto the wheel and the sally rises to , or beyond , the ceiling after a controlled pause with the bell , on or close to its balancing point , the ringer rings the backstroke by pulling the tail-end , causing the bell to swing back towards its starting position in english-style ringing the bell is rung up such that the clapper is resting on the lower edge of the bell when the bell is on the stay in change ringing where the order the bells are struck in is constantly altered , it is necessary to time the swing so that this strike occurs with precise positioning within the overall pattern to ring quickly , the bell must not complete the full 360 degrees before swinging back in the opposite direction ; while ringing slowly , the ringer waits with the bell held at the balance , before allowing it to swing back to achieve this , the ringer must work with the bell 's momentum , applying just the right amount of effort during the pull that the bell swings as far as required and no further p90-93 “ a recent examination of a number of call change ‘ peals ’ still practised at totnes in the south hams …including the ubiquitous ‘ sixty on thirds ’ discloses a remarkable affinity with the seventeenth century plain changes described by duckworth and stedman the avoidance , where possible , of repetition and the use of hunts , half-hunt and extreme changes are all features of their construction , and together suggest a basically uninterrupted descent from the earlier system , unbroken by the intrusion of change ringing '' call change ringing requires one ringer to give commands to change the order of the bells , as distinct from method ringing , where the ringers memorise the course of bells as part of a continuous pattern in call change ringing each different sequence of the bells , known as a '' row '' , is specifically called out by one ringer , the '' conductor '' , who instructs the other ringers how to change their bells ' places from row to row the change is made at the next '' handstroke '' ( when the sally on the bell rope is pulled ) , after the call in calling , the conductor usually has a strategy or plan to achieve the desired progression of rows , rather than remembering each call , and an example of these is shown in the example on eight bells calls are usually of the form '' x to ( or after ) y '' or '' x and y '' ; in which x and y refer to two of the bells by their physical numbers in the tower ( not by their positions in the row ) as an example of calling up and down , consider the following sequence of rows , and the calls a conductor would use to call them : such names are often humorous ; for example , the sequence 14235 on five bells is called weasels because it is the tune of the refrain to the children 's song pop goes the weasel one of the most important aspects of this is good striking — not only should the bells never clash by sounding at the same moment , the bells should sound to a perfect rhythm , tapping out a steady beat these competitions are organized on regional and national levels , being particularly popular among the call-change ringers of devon where it is customary to include the quality of the rise and lower of the bells as part of the judging criteria but the central council of church bell ringers opposed the move , suggesting that it would jeopardise its relationship with church bodies , since bell ringing should be seen as part of christian worship , not exercise her fictional detective , lord peter wimsey , demonstrates his skill at ringing , and the solution to the central puzzle of the book rests in part upon his knowledge of the patterns of change ringing backstroke ( or backstroke home ) – the part of a bell 's cycle started by pulling on the tail end ( rope end ) in the tower , or with the bells raised in hand ; also : the position at which the back bells come into rounds order at backstroke bob – the commonest type of call in most methods or a class of plainmethod ( in which either dodging takes place or some bells are not just hunting or place making ) ; also can mean ( usually called the '' bob place '' ) the appropriate point in the method ( e.g bump the stay – allow the bell to swing over the balance , out of control , so the stay pushes the slider to its limit , stopping the bell clapper – the metal ( usually cast iron ) rod/hammer hung from a pivot below the crown of the bell , that strikes the soundbow of the bell when the bell stops moving extent – a touch where all possible changes are rung exactly once each ; the number of such different rows is n factorial , where n is the number of bells line – the sequence of places a bell rings in a method , or the diagram describing the method ( the convention being that the treble line is shown in red while the others are blue ) slider – a device which allows the bell to go over the balance at each end of its swing , but not to over-rotate up – either : when the bells are raised to the mouth uppermost position , or : moving towards the back ( as in '' hunting up '' ) the craft of bellringing , a dvd documentary about change ringing discover bell ringing – introduction for non-ringers call changes explained ringing.info , a wide-ranging and well-organized compendium of ringing links the central council of church bell ringers central council decisions & mdash ;
