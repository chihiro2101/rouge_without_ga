'' testimony was also entered into the record stating , '' their report relied on conspiracy theorist linda thompson , organizations created or funded by the church of scientology and the unification church '' and a '' long-time cult apologist '' the large award was intended to deter similar conduct in the future ; the court noted that the defendants were unable to appreciate the maliciousness of their conduct towards the deprogrammee , and portrayed themselves , throughout the entire process of litigation , as victims of the alleged agenda of the plaintiff 's attorney , church of scientology attorney kendrick moxon frank oliver , who was until 1993 an operative in the church of scientology 's office of special affairs division ( osa ) , asserted that his last assignment with the osa branch was to assist kendrick moxon in developing a special unit to target the cult awareness network in his criticism of the piece , miscavige asserted that nightline correspondents had only interviewed members of can , stating , '' for instance , something that is n't mentioned in there is that every single detractor on there is part of a religious hate group called cult awareness

drugs by deprogrammers during deprogrammings , and occurrences of sexual intercourse between deprogrammers and deprogrammees the cff was originally in favour of deprogramming , but distanced itself from the practice in the late 1970s , when it changed its name to the cult awareness network according to the ( old ) cult awareness network 's executive director , landmark education and the church of scientology were the two groups for which can received the highest number of inquiries from concerned relatives â€“ twenty-five per month per group while the '' old can '' was set up as a tax-exempt organization serving educational purposes , coercive deprogramming referrals remained an integral part of its economy and response pattern , a contradiction that was concealed , but not resolved by the '' old can '' publicly renouncing deprogramming while covertly engaging in referrals from the resolution of the can board of directors : '' in the interests of settling a dispute and in deference to landmark 's preference , however , can now agrees not to sell the pressman book for at least five years after can emerges from bankruptcy '' in 1996 , can went bankrupt and its assets were bought by a coalition of organizations and individuals , including scientologists can declared bankruptcy after a jury found that can conspired to violate the civil rights and freedom of religion

can '' operated as a money laundering scheme , with coercive deprogrammers expected to '' kick back '' to the '' old can '' part of the fees they charged families , in the form of direct or indirect donations daniel leipold , the attorney who represented can in the suits , believed that the church of scientology did indeed have a role in the financial backing of the suits , stating , '' for every nickel we spent , they spent at least a dollar '' they expressed the view that the '' old can '' could reasonably be described as a criminal organization operating in large part for the profit to certain actors , and that it cultivated a hypocritical and deceptive public persona ted patrick , galen kelly , david clark , '' the cult awareness network and the anticult movement : implications for

and moxon since then , academics who published a joint paper with kendrick moxon and later others referencing their work have stated that the '' old can '' covertly continued to make and derive income from referrals to coercive deprogrammers and to activist members for distribution , while publicly distancing itself from the practice bob minton later hired a private investigator to look into this , and in 1998 discovered that she was actually a '' deep undercover agent '' , who was managed by david lee , a private investigator hired by the church of scientology by 1991 , the cult awareness network had twenty-three chapters dedicated to monitoring two hundred groups that it referred to as : '' mind control cults leipold also stated that when he began to take statements from some of the scientologist plaintiffs in the process of his defense of can , '' several of the plaintiffs said they had not seen or signed the lawsuits , even though the court papers bore their signatures '' they alleged that despite public denials , the '' old can '' operating policy included routine referrals to coercive deprogrammers , citing , among others , fbi wiretap evidence documenting frequent ,

director emphasized that the label '' cult '' with regard to landmark education was not important ; but rather greater scrutiny of its practices was needed when the cult awareness network 's executive director turned down the applications for fear that the new scientologist applicants would overtake control of can , they sued in separate lawsuits claiming religious discrimination
