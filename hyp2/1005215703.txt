an animal chimera is a single organism that is composed of two or more different populations of genetically distinct cells that originated from different zygotes involved in sexual reproduction chimeras can often breed , but the fertility and type of offspring depends on which cell line gave rise to the ovaries or testes ; varying degrees of intersex differences may result if one set of cells is genetically female and another genetically male put another way , the chimera is formed from the merging of two twin ( a similar merging presumably occurs with identical twins , but as their genotypes are not significantly distinct , the resulting individual would not be considered a chimera ) for example , the chimera may have a liver composed of cells with one set of chromosomes and have a kidney composed of cells with a second set of chromosomes chimeras may also show , under a certain spectrum of uv light , distinctive marks on the back resembling that of arrow points pointing downwards from the shoulders down to the lower back ; this is one expression of pigment unevenness called blaschko 's lines affected persons may be identified by the finding of two populations of red cells or , if the zygotes are of opposite sex , ambiguous genitalia and intersex alone or in combination ; such persons sometimes also have patchy skin , hair , or eye pigmentation ( heterochromia ) if the blastocysts are of opposite sex , genitals of both sexes may be formed : either ovary and testis , or combined ovotestes , in one rare form of intersex , a condition previously known as true hermaphroditism most chimeras composed of both male and female cells probably do not have an intersex condition , as might be expected if the two cell populations were evenly blended throughout the body the higher rates of autoimmune diseases due to the presence of maternally-derived cells is why in a 2010 study of a 40-year-old man with scleroderma-like disease ( an autoimmune rheumatic disease ) , the female cells detected in his blood stream via fish ( fluorescence in situ hybridization ) were thought to be maternally-derived the male , less than an inch in length , bites into her skin and releases an enzyme that digests the skin of both his mouth and her body , fusing the pair down to the blood-vessel level germline chimerism occurs when the germ cells ( for example , sperm and egg cells ) of an organism are not genetically identical to its own an individual that falls under this classification possesses two different sets of lineage ( genetic ) : one that was inherited genetically at the time of the formation of the human embryo and the other that was intentionally introduced through a medical procedure known as transplantation specific types of transplants that could induce this condition include bone marrow transplants and organ transplants , as the recipient 's body essentially works to permanently incorporate the new blood stem cells into it by utilizing transplantation and ablation in the chick embryo stage , the neural tube and the neural crest cells of the chick were ablated , and replaced with the same parts from a quail the dutch sprinter foekje dillema was expelled from the 1950 national team after she refused a mandatory sex test in july 1950 ; later investigations revealed a y-chromosome in her body cells , and the analysis showed that she was probably a 46 , xx/46 , xy mosaic female a lawyer for the prosecution heard of a human chimera in new england , karen keegan , and suggested the possibility to the defense , who were able to show that fairchild , too , was a chimera with two sets of dna , and that one of those sets could have been the mother of the children in 2002 , an article in the new england journal of medicine describes a woman in whom tetragametic chimerism was unexpectedly identified after undergoing preparations for kidney transplant that required the patient and her immediate family to undergo histocompatibility testing , the result of which suggested that she was not the biologic mother of two of her three children if a human chimera is formed from a male and female zygote fusing into a single embryo , giving an individual functional gonadal tissue of both types , such a self-fertilization is feasible in 2019 , the blood and seminal fluid of a man in reno , nevada ( who had undergone a vasectomy ) , exhibited only the genetic content of his bone marrow donor the dna content of semen from an assault case in 2004 matched that of a man who had been in prison at the time of the assault , but who had been a bone marrow donor for his brother , who was later determined to have committed the crime by simply undergoing a dna test , which usually consists of either a swift cheek swab or a blood test , the discovery of the once unknown second genome is made , therefore identifying that individual as a chimera on january 22 , 2019 the national society of genetic counselors released an article — chimerism explained : how one person can unknowingly have two sets of dna , where they state “ tetragametic chimerism , where a twin pregnancy evolves into one child , is currently believed to be one of the rarer forms image : chimericmousewithpups.jpg thumb a chimeric mouse with its offspring , which carry the w : agouti gene ; note pink eye chimeric mice are important animals in biological research , as they allow for the investigation of a variety of biological questions in an animal that has two distinct genetic pools within it between the stages of fertilization of the egg and the implantation of a blastocyst into the uterus , different parts of the mouse embryo retain the ability to give rise to a variety of cell lineages two- to eight-cell-stage embryos are competent for making chimeras , since at these stages of development , the cells in the embryos are not yet committed to give rise to any particular cell lineage , and could give rise to the inner cell mass or the trophectoderm in the case where two diploid eight-cell-stage embryos are used to make a chimera , chimerism can be later found in the epiblast , primitive endoderm , and trophectoderm of the mouse blastocyst the inner cell mass of a diploid blastocyst , for example , can be used to make a chimera with another blastocyst of eight-cell diploid embryo ; the cells taken from the inner cell mass will give rise to the primitive endoderm and to the epiblast in the chimera mouse there are a variety of combinations that can give rise to a successful chimera mouse and according to the goal of the experiment an appropriate cell and embryo combination can be picked ; they are generally but not limited to diploid embryo and es cells , diploid embryo and diploid embryo , es cell and tetraploid embryo , diploid embryo and tetraploid embryo , es cells and es cells if embryonic stem cells are to be used for gene targeting to make a chimera , the following procedure is common : a construct for homologous recombination for the gene targeted will be introduced into cultured mouse embryonic stem cells from the donor mouse , by way of electroporation ; cells positive for the recombination event will have antibiotic resistance , provided by the insertion cassette used in the gene targeting ; and be able to be positively selected for then , these injected blastocysts are implanted into a pseudo pregnant female surrogate mouse , which will bring the embryos to term and give birth to a mouse whose germline is derived from the donor mouse 's es cells chimera mouse production by blastocyst injection , wellcome trust sanger institute , this same procedure can be achieved through aggregation of es cells and diploid embryos , diploid embryos are cultured in aggregation plates in wells where single embryos can fit , to these wells es cells are added the aggregates are cultured until a single embryo is formed and has progressed to the blastocyst stage , and can then be transferred to the surrogate mouse well-known examples of a graft-chimera are laburnocytisus 'adamii ' , caused by a fusion of a laburnum and a broom , and '' family '' trees , where multiple varieties of apple or pear are grafted onto the same tree
