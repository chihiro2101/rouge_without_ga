general topology grew out of a number of areas , most importantly the following : the detailed study of subsets of the real line ( once known as the topology of point sets ; this usage is now obsolete ) the introduction of the manifold concept the study of metric spaces , especially normed linear spaces , in the early days of functional analysis in many instances , this is accomplished by specifying when a point is the limit of a sequence , but for some spaces that are too large in some sense , one specifies also when a point is the limit of more general sets of points indexed by a directed set , known as nets both the empty set and x are elements of τ any union of elements of τ is an element of τ any intersection of finitely many elements of τ is an element of τ if τ is a topology on x , then the pair ( x , τ ) is called a topological space a quotient space is defined as follows : if x is a topological space and y is a set , and if f : x→ y is a surjection function , then the quotient topology on y is the collection of subsets of y that have open inverse images under f if γ is an ordinal number , then the set γ [ 0 , & nbsp ; γ ) may be endowed with the order topology generated by the intervals ( a , & nbsp ; b ) , [ 0 , & nbsp ; b ) and ( a , & nbsp ; γ ) where a and b are elements of γ instead of specifying the open subsets of a topological space , the topology can also be determined by a closure operator ( denoted cl ) , which assigns to any subset a ⊆ x its closure , or an interior operator ( denoted int ) , which assigns to any subset a of x its interior every subset of a topological space can be given the subspace topology in which the open sets are the intersections of the open sets of the larger space with the subset on the other hand , if is equipped with the indiscrete topology and the space set is at least t0 space , then the only continuous functions are the constant functions a base ( or basis ) b for a topological space x with topology t is a collection of open sets in t such that every open set in t can be written as a union of elements of b in the former case , preservation of limits is also sufficient ; in the latter , a function may preserve all limits of sequences yet still fail to be continuous , and preservation of nets is a necessary and sufficient condition that is , a topological space ( x , \tau ) is said to be metrizable if there is a metric : d\colon x \times x \to [ 0 , \infty ) such that the topology induced by d is \tau a topological algebra a over a topological field k is a topological vector space together with a continuous multiplication : \cdot : a\times a \longrightarrow a : ( a , b ) \longmapsto a\cdot b that makes it an algebra over k for any indexed family of topological spaces , the product can be given the product topology , which is generated by the inverse images of open sets of the factors under the projection mappings in these terms , a function : f\colon ( x , \mathrm such that for any x , y , z \in m , the following holds : d ( x , y ) \ge 0 & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; ( non-negative ) , d ( x , y ) 0\ , iff x y\ , & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; ( identity of indiscernibles ) , d ( x , y ) d ( y , x ) \ , & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; ( symmetry ) and d ( x , z ) \le d ( x , y ) + d ( y , z ) & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; ( triangle inequality ) note , however , that if the target space is hausdorff , it is still true that f is continuous at a if and only if the limit of f as x approaches a is f ( a ) for infinite products , there is the additional requirement that in a basic open set , all but finitely many of its projections are the entire space also , any set can be given the trivial topology ( also called the indiscrete topology ) , in which only the empty set and the whole space are open every metric space can be given a metric topology , in which the basic open sets are open balls defined by the metric an extreme example : if a set is given the discrete topology , all functions : f\colon x \rightarrow t to any topological space are continuous the set of all open intervals forms a base or basis for the topology , meaning that every open set is a union of some collection of sets from the base the topological characteristics of fractals in fractal geometry , of julia sets and the mandelbrot set arising in complex dynamics , and of attractors in differential equations are often critical to understanding these systems bases are useful because many properties of topologies can be reduced to statements about a base that generates that topology—and because many topologies are most easily defined in terms of a base that generates them this topology on r is strictly finer than the euclidean topology defined above ; a sequence converges to a point in this topology if and only if it converges from above in the euclidean topology in topology and related areas of mathematics , a metrizable space is a topological space that is homeomorphic to a metric space any set can be given the cofinite topology in which the open sets are the empty set and the sets whose complement is finite any set can be given the cocountable topology , in which a set is defined as open if it is either empty or its complement is countable
