pufendorf left jena in 1658 as magister and became a tutor in the family of peter julius coyet , one of the resident ministers of king charles x gustav of sweden , at copenhagen with the help of his brother , a diplomat in the swedish service he occupied himself in meditating upon what he had read in the works of hugo grotius and thomas hobbes , and mentally constructed a system of universal law the work was dedicated to charles louis , elector palatine , who created for pufendorf a new chair at the university of heidelberg , that of the law of nature and nations chances for advancement were few in a germany that still suffered from the ravages of the thirty years ' war ( 1618-1648 ) , so pufendorf went to sweden where that year he was called to the university of lund in 1672 appeared de jure naturae et gentium libri octo , and in 1673 a résumé of it under the title de officio hominis et civis ( '' on the duty of man and citizen '' ) , which , among other topics , gave his analysis of just war theory in de jure naturae et gentium pufendorf took up in great measure the theories of grotius and sought to complete them by means of the doctrines of hobbes and of his own ideas on jus gentium as regards public law pufendorf , while recognizing in the state ( civitas ) a moral person ( persona moralis ) , teaches that the will of the state is but the sum of the individual wills that constitute it , and that this association explains the state in this a priori conception , in which he scarcely gives proof of historical insight , he shows himself as one of the precursors of rousseau and of the contrat social this work propounded for the first time the so-called '' collegial '' theory of church government ( kollegialsystem ) , which , developed later by the learned lutheran theologian , formed the basis of the relations of church and state in germany and more especially in prussia this theory makes a fundamental distinction between the supreme jurisdiction in ecclesiastical matters ( kirchenhoheit or jus circa sacra ) , which it conceives as inherent in the power of the state in respect of every religious communion , and the ecclesiastical power ( kirchengewalt or jus in sacra ) inherent in the church , but in some cases vested in the state by tacit or expressed consent of the ecclesiastical body his son frederick iii fulfilled the promises of his father ; and pufendorf , historiographer and privy councillor , was instructed to write a history of the elector frederick william ( de rebus gestis frederici wilhelmi magni ) in terms of public law , which recognizes the state ( civitas ) as a moral person ( persona moralis ) , pufendorf argues that the will of the state is nevertheless nothing more than the sum of the individual wills that are associated within it ; hence the state needs to submit to a discipline essential for human safety this 'submission ' , in the sense of obedience and mutual respect , is for pufendorf the fundamental law of reason , which is the basis of natural law
