in europe , the term is '' medicinal product '' , and it is defined by eu law as : '' any substance or combination of substances presented as having properties for treating or preventing disease in human beings ; or '' '' any substance or combination of substances which may be used in or administered to human beings either with a view to restoring , correcting or modifying physiological functions by exerting a pharmacological , immunological or metabolic action , or to making a medical diagnosis a substance intended for use as a component of a medicine but not a device or a component , part or accessory of a device drug use among elderly americans has been studied ; in a group of 2377 people with average age of 71 surveyed between 2005 and 2006 , 84 % took at least one prescription drug , 44 % took at least one over-the-counter ( otc ) drug , and 52 % took at least one dietary supplement ; in a group of 2245 elderly americans ( average age of 71 ) surveyed over the period 2010 – 2011 , those percentages were 88 % , 38 % , and 64 % one of the key classifications is between traditional small molecule drugs ; usually derived from chemical synthesis , and biologic medical products ; which include recombinant proteins , vaccines , blood products used therapeutically ( such as ivig ) , gene therapy , and cell therapy ( for instance , stem cell therapies ) pharmaceuticals or drugs or medicines are classified in various other groups besides their origin on the basis of pharmacological properties like mode of action and their pharmacological action or activity , database of prescription pharmaceutical products including drug classifications such as by chemical property , mode or route of administration , biological system affected , or therapeutic effects an elaborate and widely used classification system is the anatomical therapeutic chemical classification system ( atc system ) a sampling of classes of medicine includes : antipyretics : reducing fever ( pyrexia/pyresis ) analgesics : reducing pain ( painkillers ) antimalarial drugs : treating malaria antibiotics : inhibiting germ growth antiseptics : prevention of germ growth near burns , cuts and wounds mood stabilizers : lithium and valpromide hormone replacements : premarin oral contraceptives : enovid , '' biphasic '' pill , and '' triphasic '' pill stimulants : methylphenidate , amphetamine tranquilizers : meprobamate , chlorpromazine , reserpine , chlordiazepoxide , diazepam , and alprazolam statins : lovastatin , pravastatin , and simvastatin pharmaceuticals may also be described as '' specialty '' , independent of other classifications , which is an ill-defined class of drugs that might be difficult to administer , require special handling during administration , require patient monitoring during and immediately after administration , have particular regulatory requirements restricting their use , and are generally expensive relative to other drugs drugs affecting the central nervous system include : psychedelics , hypnotics , anaesthetics , antipsychotics , eugeroics , antidepressants ( including tricyclic antidepressants , monoamine oxidase inhibitors , lithium salts , and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( ssris ) ) , antiemetics , anticonvulsants/antiepileptics , anxiolytics , barbiturates , movement disorder ( e.g , parkinson 's disease ) drugs , stimulants ( including amphetamines ) , benzodiazepines , cyclopyrrolones , dopamine antagonists , antihistamines , cholinergics , anticholinergics , emetics , cannabinoids , and serotonin antagonist androgens , antiandrogens , estrogens , gonadotropin , corticosteroids , human growth hormone , insulin , antidiabetics ( sulfonylureas , biguanides/metformin , thiazolidinediones , insulin ) , thyroid hormones , antithyroid drugs , calcitonin , diphosphonate , vasopressin analogues nsaids , anticholinergics , haemostatic drugs , antifibrinolytics , hormone therapy ( hrt ) , bone regulators , beta-receptor agonists , follicle stimulating hormone , luteinising hormone , lhrh , gamolenic acid , gonadotropin release inhibitor , progestogen , dopamine agonists , estrogen , prostaglandins , gonadorelin , clomiphene , tamoxifen , diethylstilbestrol emollients , antipruritic , antifungals , antiseptics , scabicides , pediculicides , tar products , vitamin a derivatives , vitamin d analogues , keratolytics , abrasives , systemic antibiotics , topical antibiotics , hormones , desloughing agents , exudate absorbents , fibrinolytics , proteolytics , sunscreens , antiperspirants , corticosteroids , immune modulators tonics , electrolytes and mineral preparations ( including iron preparations and magnesium preparations ) , parenteral nutritions , vitamins , anti-obesity drugs , anabolic drugs , haematopoietic drugs , food product drugs there are three major categories of drug administration ; enteral ( via the human gastrointestinal tract ) , injection , and other ( dermis , nasal , ophthalmic , ear , and urogenital ) in the fields of medicine , biotechnology and pharmacology , drug discovery is the process by which new drugs are discovered later chemical library of synthetic small molecules , natural products or extracts were screened in intact cells or whole organisms to identify substances that have a desirable therapeutic effect in a process known as classical pharmacology since sequencing of the human genome which allowed rapid cloning and synthesis of large quantities of purified proteins , it has become common practice to use high throughput screening of large compounds libraries against isolated biological targets which are hypothesized to be disease-modifying in a process known as reverse pharmacology even more recently , scientists have been able to understand the shape of biological molecules at the atomic level , and to use that knowledge to design ( see drug design ) drug candidates modern drug discovery involves the identification of screening hits , medicinal chemistry and optimization of those hits to increase the affinity , selectivity ( to reduce the potential of side effects ) , efficacy/potency , metabolic stability ( to increase the half-life ) , and oral bioavailability despite advances in technology and understanding of biological systems , drug discovery is still a lengthy , '' expensive , difficult , and inefficient process '' with low rate of new therapeutic discovery drug development is the process of bringing a new drug to the market once a lead compound has been identified through the process of drug discovery in other jurisdictions , they are regulated at the state level , or at both state and national levels by various bodies , as is the case in australia depending upon the jurisdiction , drugs may be divided into over-the-counter drugs ( otc ) which may be available without special restrictions , and prescription drugs , which must be prescribed by a licensed medical practitioner in accordance with medical guidelines due to the risk of adverse effects and contraindications these do not require a prescription , but must be kept in the dispensary , not visible to the public , and only be sold by a pharmacist or pharmacy technician many countries , such as the united kingdom have a third category of '' pharmacy medicines '' , which can only be sold in registered pharmacy by or under the supervision of a pharmacist in 2000 the definition of a prescription error was studied using a delphi method conference ; the conference was motivated by ambiguity in the what a prescription error and a need to use a uniform definition in studies the prices are negotiated between the department of health , acting with the authority of northern ireland and the uk government , and the representatives of the pharmaceutical industry brands , the association of the british pharmaceutical industry ( abpi ) furthermore , '' the international therapeutic class comparison test is responsible for comparing the national average transaction price of the patented drug product under review '' different countries that the prices are being compared to are the following : france , germany , italy , sweden , switzerland , the united kingdom , and the united states : : '' in the pharmaceutical industry , a blockbuster drug is one that achieves acceptance by prescribing physicians as a therapeutic standard for , most commonly , a highly prevalent chronic ( rather than acute ) condition streptomycin , found in 1942 , proved to be the first drug effective against the cause of tuberculosis and also came to be the best known of a long series of important antibiotics in 1970 , sales began to decline for valium and librium , but sales of new and improved tranquilizers , such as xanax , introduced in 1981 for the newly created diagnosis of panic disorder , soared the 1991 launch of pravachol ( pravastatin ) , the second available in the united states , and the release of zocor ( simvastatin ) made mevacor no longer the only statin on the market on the indian subcontinent , the atharvaveda , a sacred text of hinduism whose core dates from the 2nd millennium bc , although the hymns recorded in it are believed to be older , is the first indic text dealing with medicine the student of āyurveda was expected to know ten arts that were indispensable in the preparation and application of his medicines : distillation , operative skills , cooking , horticulture , metallurgy , sugar manufacture , pharmacy , analysis and separation of minerals , compounding of metals , and preparation of alkalis theodoric borgognoni , ( 1205–1296 ) , one of the most significant surgeons of the medieval period , responsible for introducing and promoting important surgical advances including basic antiseptic practice and the use of anaesthetics to famously comment in 1842 that '' if all medicines in the world were thrown into the sea , it would be all the better for mankind and all the worse for the fishes '' the second world war saw the introduction of widespread and effective antimicrobial therapy with the development and mass production of penicillin antibiotics , made possible by the pressures of the war and the collaboration of british scientists with the american pharmaceutical industry in the 1950s , other drugs emerged including corticosteroids for inflammation , rauvolfia alkaloids as tranqulizers and antihypertensives , antihistamines for nasal allergies , xanthines for asthma , and typical antipsychotics for psychosis recently , multi-disciplinary approaches have yielded a wealth of new data on the development of novel antibiotics and antibacterials and on the use of biological agents for antibacterial therapy , the elixir sulfanilamide disaster led to the establishment of the food and drug administration , and the 1938 federal food , drug , and cosmetic act required manufacturers to file new drugs with the fda often grouped under the labels of compassionate use , expanded access , or named patient supply , these programs are governed by rules which vary by country defining access criteria , data collection , promotion , and control of drug distribution outside the us , named patient programs provide controlled , pre-approval access to drugs in response to requests by physicians on behalf of specific , or '' named '' , patients before those medicines are licensed in the patient 's home country through these programs , patients are able to access drugs in late-stage clinical trials or approved in other countries for a genuine , unmet medical need , before those drugs have been licensed in the patient 's home country in the united states , act up formed in the 1980s , and eventually formed its treatment action group in part to pressure the us government to put more resources into discovering treatments for aids and then to speed release of drugs that were under development essential medicines as defined by the world health organization ( who ) are '' those drugs that satisfy the health care needs of the majority of the population ; they should therefore be available at all times in adequate amounts and in appropriate dosage forms , at a price the community can afford '' recent studies have found that most of the medicines on the who essential medicines list , outside of the field of hiv drugs , are not patented in the developing world , and that lack of widespread access to medicines arise from issues fundamental to economic development – lack of infrastructure and poverty patent landscape analysis of healthcare innovations médecins sans frontières also runs a campaign for access to essential medicines campaign , which includes advocacy for greater resources to be devoted to currently untreatable diseases that primarily occur in the developing world world trade organization negotiations in the 1990s , including the trips agreement and the doha declaration , have centered on issues at the intersection of international trade in pharmaceuticals and intellectual property rights , with developed world nations seeking strong intellectual property rights to protect investments made to develop new drugs , and developing world nations seeking to promote their generic pharmaceuticals industries and their ability to make medicine available to their people via compulsory licenses some have raised ethical objections specifically with respect to pharmaceutical patents and the high prices for drugs that they enable their proprietors to charge , which poor people in the developed world , and developing world , can not afford other critics claim that patent settlements would be costly for consumers , the health care system , and state and federal governments because it would result in delaying access to lower cost generic medicines
