many period 6 transition metals are very valuable , such as gold , however many period 6 other metals are incredibly toxic , such as thallium after bismuth , which has a half-life or more than 10 19 years , polonium , astatine , and radon are some of the half-life and rarest elements known ; less than a gram of astatine is estimated to exist on earth at any given time : between initial xe and final 6s 2 electronic shells the lanthanide elements are the group of elements with atomic number increasing from 57 ( lanthanum ) to 71 ( lutetium ) in presentations of the periodic table , the lanthanides and the actinides are customarily shown as two additional rows below the main body of the table , with placeholders or else a selected single element of each series ( either lanthanum or lutetium , and either actinium or lawrencium , respectively ) shown in a single cell of the main table , between barium and hafnium , and radium and rutherfordium , respectively this convention is entirely a matter of aesthetics and formatting practicality ; a rarely used wide-formatted periodic table inserts the lanthanide and actinide series in their proper places , as parts of the table 's sixth and seventh rows ( periods ) it is the last element in the lanthanide series , which , along with the lanthanide contraction , explains several important properties of lutetium , such as it having the highest hardness or density among lanthanides unlike other lanthanides , which lie in the f-block of the periodic table , this element lies in the d-block ; however , lanthanum is sometimes placed on the d-block lanthanide position the dispute on the priority of the discovery occurred shortly after , with urbain and von welsbach accusing each other of publishing results influenced by the published research of the other ; the naming honor went to urbain as he published his results earlier in 1909 , the priority was finally granted to urbain and his names were adopted as official ones ; however , the name cassiopeium ( or later cassiopium ) for element 71 proposed by von welsbach was used by many german scientists until the 1950s the chemical inertness of tantalum makes it a valuable substance for laboratory equipment and a substitute for platinum , but its main use today is in tantalum capacitors in electronic equipment such as mobile phones , dvd players , video game systems and computers tantalum , always together with the chemically similar niobium , occurs in the minerals tantalite , columbite and coltan ( a mix of columbite and tantalite ) tungsten , also known as wolfram , is a chemical element with the chemical symbol w and atomic number 74 the free element is remarkable for its robustness , especially the fact that it has the highest melting point of all the non-alloyed metals and the second highest of all the elements after carbon also remarkable is its high density of 19.3 times that of water , comparable to that of uranium and gold , and much higher ( about 1.7 times ) than that of lead tungsten is the only metal from the third transition series that is known to occur in biomolecules , where it is used in a few species of bacteria with an estimated average concentration of 1 part per billion ( ppb ) , rhenium is one of the rarest elements in the earth 's crust nickel-based superalloys of rhenium are used in the combustion chambers , turbine blades , and exhaust nozzles of jet engines , these alloys contain up to 6 % rhenium , making jet engine construction the largest single use for the element , with the chemical industry 's catalytic uses being next-most important because of the low availability relative to demand , rhenium is among the most expensive of metals , with an average price of approximately us 4,575 per kilogram ( us 142.30 per troy ounce ) as of august 2011 ; it is also of critical strategic military importance , for its use in high performance military jet and rocket engines it is a hard , brittle , blue-gray or blue-black transition metal in the platinum family and is the densest naturally occurring element , with a density of ( slightly greater than that of iridium and twice that of lead ) it is found in nature as an alloy , mostly in platinum ores ; its alloys with platinum , iridium , and other platinum group metals are employed in fountain pen tips , electrical contacts , and other applications where extreme durability and hardness are needed a very hard , brittle , silvery-white transition metal of the platinum group , iridium is the second-density element ( after osmium ) and is the most corrosion-resistant metal , even at temperatures as high as 2000 & nbsp ; °c smithson tennant , the primary discoverer , named the iridium for the goddess iris , personification of the rainbow , because of the striking and diverse colors of its salts and are the only two naturally occurring isotopes of iridium as well as the only stable isotopes ; the latter is the more abundant of the two the most important iridium compounds in use are the salts and acids it forms with chlorine , though iridium also forms a number of organometallic compounds used in industrial catalysis , and in research iridium metal is employed when high corrosion resistance at high temperatures is needed , as in high-end spark plugs , crucibles for recrystallization of semiconductors at high temperatures , and electrodes for the production of chlorine in the chloralkali process for this reason the unusually high abundance of iridium in the clay layer at the cretaceous–paleogene boundary gave rise to the alvarez hypothesis that the impact of a massive extraterrestrial object caused the extinction of dinosaurs and many other species 66 & nbsp ; million years ago it is thought that the total amount of iridium in the planet earth is much higher than that observed in crustal rocks , but as with other platinum group metals , the high density and tendency of iridium to bond with iron caused most iridium to descend below the crust when the planet was young and still molten as a member of the platinum group of elements , as well as of the group 10 of the periodic table of elements , platinum is generally non-reactive gold is insoluble in nitric acid , which dissolves silver and base metals , a property that has long been used to confirm the presence of gold in items , giving rise to the term the acid test in europe , most countries left the gold standard with the start of world war i in 1914 and , with huge war debts , failed to return to gold as a medium of exchange its high malleability , ductility , resistance to corrosion and most other chemical reactions , and conductivity of electricity led to many uses of gold , including electric wiring , colored-glass production and even gold leaf eating mercury is used in thermometers , barometers , manometers , sphygmomanometers , float valves , mercury switches , and other devices though concerns about the element 's toxicity have led to mercury thermometers and sphygmomanometers being largely phased out in clinical environments in favor of ethanol-filled , galinstan-filled , digital , or thermistor-based instruments lead is used in building construction , lead–acid battery , bullets and shots , weights , as part of solders , pewters , fusible alloys and as a radiation shield lead has the highest atomic number of all of the stable elements , although the next higher element , bismuth , has a half-life that is so long ( much longer than the age of the universe ) that it can be considered stable recently , however , it has been found to be very slightly radioactive : its only primordial isotope bismuth-209 decays via alpha decay into thallium-205 with a half-life of more than a billion times the estimated age of the universe as the toxicity of lead has become more apparent in recent years , alloy uses for bismuth metal ( presently about a third of bismuth production ) , as a replacement for lead , have become an increasing part of bismuth 's commercial importance it occurs on the earth only as the result of decay of heavier elements , and decays away rapidly , so much less is known about this element than its upper neighbors in the periodic table the main difference between astatine and iodine is that the hat molecule is chemically a hydride rather than a halide ; however , in a fashion similar to the lighter halogens , it is known to form ionic astatides with metals the second longest-living astatine-211 is the only one to find a commercial use , being useful as an alpha decay in medicine ; however , only extremely small quantities are used , and in larger ones it is very hazardous , as it is intensely radioactive three years later , it was found in nature ; however , with an estimated amount of less than 28 & nbsp ; grams ( 1 & nbsp ; oz ) at given time , astatine is the least abundant element in earth 's crust among non-transuranium elements among astatine isotopes , six ( with mass numbers 214 to 219 ) are present in nature as the result of decay of heavier elements ; however , the most stable astatine-210 and the industrially used astatine-211 are not uranium and thorium , radium , and thus radon , will continue to occur for millions of years at about the same concentrations as they do now
