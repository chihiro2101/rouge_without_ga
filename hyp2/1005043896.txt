in order to playback the sound recorded on one of the tinfoil cylinders , the recording process is essentially reversed this vibration comes out of the diaphragm , which is now functioning as a sort of sound amplification device , much like the bell on any wind instrument the biggest of these , and the one that ended up being fixed first , came from the physical contact between the phonograph needle and the tinfoil diaphragm fidelity is the similarity/difference between the original recorded sound , and that same sound after it has been reproduced by a playback device , in this case the phonograph this lack of sound quality is why the phonograph was originally used to record speeches , meetings , and telephone calls , rather than music this machine was vastly different from the gramophone or the phonograph , in that instead of recording sound mechanically , it recorded using a process called magnetic storage poulsen was able to transmit an electrical signal , much like the one that would broadcast over the radio or a telephone , and then capture it on a magnetizable element , in this case a length of steel wire , which was wrapped around a bass drum secondly , steel 's scarcity at the time raised the price of recording ; a single minute of recording would cost a full dollar , and the price was further increased because multiple recordings were necessary in order to capture the best rendition rather than cutting and splicing together multiple takes , as could easily be done with scissors or a computer in future recording devices , this machine required both a welding torch and a soldering tool to modify an inscriber , called the recording head , passes over the electromagnetic paper strip , creating patterns of varying magnetic polarity within it , which can later be played back the pre-magnetized paper , which had come to be known as tape , passed over a coil , creating changes in magnetic flux this is the method all recording studios use to this day , in order to record all of the separate instruments of a song , and get the best possible takes from all of the musicians a wide variety of audio tape recorders and formats were then developed , most significantly reel-to-reel and compact cassette both of which were very widely used throughout most of the late 20th century nowadays , while digital recording to flash memory and hard disk has largely supplanted magnetic tape for most purposes , tape as a verb and as a noun has remained the common parlance for the recording process
