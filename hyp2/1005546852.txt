aflatoxin m1 is present in the fermentation broth of aspergillus parasiticus , but it and aflatoxin m 2 are also produced when an infected liver metabolizes aflatoxin b 1 and b 2 flavus and aspergillus parasiticus aflatoxin m 1 ( afm 1 ) , metabolite of aflatoxin b 1 in humans and animals ( exposure in ng levels may come from a mother 's milk ) aflatoxin m 2 , metabolite of aflatoxin b 2 in milk of cattle fed on contaminated foods aflatoxicol ( afl ) : metabolite produced by breaking down the lactone ring aflatoxin q 1 ( afq 1 ) , major metabolite of afb 1 in in vitro liver preparations of other higher vertebrates afm , afq , and afl retain the possibly to become an epoxide aflatoxins are produced by both aspergillus flavus and aspergillus parasiticus , which are common forms of 'weedy ' molds widespread in nature the native habitat of aspergillus is in soil , decaying vegetation , hay , and grains undergoing microbiological deterioration , but it invades all types of organic substrates whenever conditions are favorable for its growth the staple commodities regularly contaminated with aflatoxins include cassava , chilies , corn , cotton seed , millet , peanuts , rice , sorghum , sunflower seeds , tree nuts , wheat , and a variety of spices intended for human or animal consumption aflatoxin transformation products are sometimes found in eggs , milk products , and meat when animals are fed contaminated grains adult humans have a high tolerance for aflatoxin exposure and rarely succumb to acute aflatoxicosis , but children are particularly affected , and their exposure can lead to stunted growth and delayed development , in addition to all the symptoms mentioned below chronic exposure increases the risk of developing liver and gallbladder cancer , as aflatoxin metabolites may intercalate into dna and alkylate the bases through epoxide moiety as with other dna-alkylating agents , aflatoxin b 1 can cause immune suppression , and exposure to it is associated with an increased viral load in hiv positive individuals symptomatic and supportive care tailored to the severity of the liver disease may include intravenous fluids with dextrose , active vitamin k , b vitamins , and a restricted , but high-quality protein diet with adequate carbohydrate content some studies on pregnant hamsters showed a significant relationship between exposure of aflatoxin b 1 ( 4 & nbsp ; mg/kg , single dose ) and the appearance of teratology in their offspring due to the half-life of this metabolite , the level of afb 1 -guanine measured may vary from day to day , based on diet , it is not ideal for assessing long-term exposure
