this allowed him to reformulate the problem in abstract terms ( laying the foundations of graph theory ) , eliminating all features except the list of land masses and the bridges connecting them in modern terms , one replaces each land mass with an abstract '' vertex '' or node , and each bridge with an abstract connection , an '' edge '' , which only serves to record which pair of vertices ( land masses ) is connected by that bridge next , euler observed that ( except at the endpoints of the walk ) , whenever one enters a vertex by a bridge , one leaves the vertex by a bridge now , if every bridge has been traversed exactly once , it follows that , for each land mass ( except for the ones chosen for the start and finish ) , the number of bridges touching that land mass must be even ( half of them , in the particular traversal , will be traversed '' toward '' the landmass ; the other half , '' away '' from it ) however , all four of the land masses in the original problem are touched by an odd number of bridges ( one is touched by 5 bridges , and each of the other three is touched by 3 ) in modern language , euler shows that the possibility of a walk through a graph , traversing each edge exactly once , depends on the degrees of the nodes petersburg academy on 26 august 1735 , and published as solutio problematis ad geometriam situs pertinentis ( the solution of a problem relating to the geometry of position ) in the journal commentarii academiae scientiarum petropolitanae in 1741 in the history of mathematics , euler 's solution of the königsberg bridge problem is considered to be the first theorem of graph theory and the first true proof in the theory of networks , a subject now generally regarded as a branch of combinatorics in addition , euler 's recognition that the key information was the number of bridges and the list of their endpoints ( rather than their exact positions ) presaged the development of topology the university of canterbury in christchurch has incorporated a model of the bridges into a grass area between the old physical sciences library and the erskine building , housing the departments of mathematics , statistics and computer science kaliningrad and the konigsberg bridge problem at convergence euler 's original publication ( in latin ) the bridges of königsberg how the bridges of königsberg help to understand the brain euler 's königsberg 's bridges problem at math dept
