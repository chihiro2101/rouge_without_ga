plethon is also an archaic translation of the greek γεμιστός gemistós ( '' full , stuffed '' ) some time before 1410 , emperor manuel ii paleologus sent him to mistra in the despotate of morea in the southern peloponnese , which remained his home for the rest of his life in constantinople , he had been a senator , and he continued to fulfil various public functions , such as being a judge , and was regularly consulted by rulers of morea byzantine scholars had been in contact with their counterparts in western europe since the time of the latin empire , and especially since the byzantine empire had begun to ask for western european help against the ottomans in the 14th century byzantine scholarship became more fully available to the west after 1438 , when byzantine emperor john viii palaeologus attended the council of ferrara , later known as the council of florence , to discuss a union of the eastern orthodoxy and catholic church churches few of plato 's writings were studied in the latin west at that time , timaeus in the partial translation of calcidius was available ; henricus aristippus ' 12th century translation of the meno and phaedo was available , but obscure ; leonardo bruni 's translations of the phaedo , apology , crito and phaedrus appeared only shortly before pletho 's visit ( debolt ) and he essentially reintroduced much of plato to the western world , shaking the domination which aristotle had come to exercise over western european thought in the high and later middle ages marsilio ficino 's introduction to the translation of plotinus has traditionally been interpreted to the effect that cosimo de ' medici attended pletho 's lectures and was inspired to found the accademia platonica in florence , where italian students of pletho continued to teach after the conclusion of the council marsilio ficino , the florentine humanism and the first director of the accademia platonica , paid plethon the ultimate honour , calling him 'the second plato ' , while cardinal bessarion speculated as to whether plato 's soul occupied his body believing that the peloponnese were direct descendants of the ancient hellenes , plethon rejected justinian 's idea of a universal empire in favour of recreating the hellenistic civilization , the zenith of greek influence in de differentiis plethon compares aristotle 's and plato 's conceptions of god , arguing that plato credits god with more exalted powers as '' creator of every kind of intelligible and separate substance , and hence of our entire universe '' , while aristotle has god as only the motive force of the universe ; plato 's god is also the end and final cause of existence , while aristotle 's god is only the end of movement and change plethon derides aristotle for discussing unimportant matters such as shellfish and embryos while failing to credit god with creating the universe , for believing the heavens are composed of a fifth element , and for his view that contemplation was the greatest pleasure ; the latter aligned him with epicurus , plethon argued , and he attributed this same pleasure-seeking to monks , whom he accused of laziness later , in response to gennadius ' defence of aristotle , plethon argued in his reply that plato 's god was more consistent with christian doctrine than aristotle 's , and this , according to darien debolt , was probably in part an attempt to escape suspicion of heterodoxy morea was under invasion from sultan mehmet ii , and theodora escaped with demetrios to constantinople where she gave the manuscript back to gennadius , reluctant to destroy the only copy of such a distinguished scholar 's work herself gennadius burnt it in 1460 ; however , in a letter to the exarch joseph ( which still survives ) he details the book , providing chapter headings and brief summaries of the contents this same divine order , he believed , governed the organisation of bees , the foresight of ants and the dexterity of spiders , as well as the growth of plants , magnetic attraction , and the amalgamation of mercury and gold the new state religion was to be founded on a hierarchical pantheon of pagan gods , based largely upon the ideas of humanism prevalent at the time , incorporating themes such as rationalism and logic the political and social elements of his theories covered the creation of communities , government ( he promoted benevolent monarchy as the most stable form ) , land ownership ( land should be shared , rather than individually owned ) , social organisation , families , and divisions of sex and class this summary , titled summary of the doctrines of zoroaster and plato , affirms the existence of a pantheon of gods , with zeus as supreme sovereign , containing within himself all being in an undivided state ; his eldest child , motherless , is poseidon , who created the heavens and rules all below , ordaining order in the universe pound was fascinated by the role that plethon 's conversation must have had on cosimo de medici and his decision to acquire greek manuscripts of plato and neoplatonic philosophers by having manuscripts brought from greece and becoming the patron of '' the young boy , ficino , '' cosimo facilitated the preservation and transmission of greek cultural patrimony into the modern world after the fall of constantinople in 1453
