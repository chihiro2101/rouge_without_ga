mayan languages are the descendants of a proto-language called proto-mayan or , in kʼicheʼ maya , nabʼee mayaʼ tzij ( '' the old maya language '' ) the proto-mayan language is believed to have been spoken in the cuchumatanes highlands of central guatemala in an area corresponding roughly to where qʼanjobalan is spoken today according to an alternative theory by robertson and houston , huastecan stayed in the guatemalan highlands with speakers of chʼolan–tzeltalan , separating from that branch at a much later date than proposed by kaufman this theory was first proposed by in the case of the xincan and lencan languages , on the other hand , mayan languages are more often the source than the receiver of loanwords mayan language specialists such as campbell believe this suggests a period of intense contact between maya and the lencan and xinca people , possibly during the classic period ( 250–900 ) the split between proto-yucatecan ( in the north , that is , the yucatán peninsula ) and proto-chʼolan ( in the south , that is , the chiapas highlands and petén basin ) had already occurred by the classic period , when most extant glyphic writing were written both variants are attested in hieroglyphic inscriptions at the maya sites of the time , and both are commonly referred to as '' classic maya language '' although a single prestige language was by far the most frequently recorded on extant hieroglyphic texts , evidence for at least three different varieties of mayan have been discovered within the hieroglyphic corpus—an eastern chʼolan variety found in texts written in the southern maya area and the highlands , a western chʼolan variety diffused from the usumacinta region from the mid-7th century on , and a yucatecan variety found in the texts from the yucatán peninsula the reason why only few linguistic varieties are found in the glyphic texts is probably that these served as prestige dialects throughout the maya region ; hieroglyphic texts would have been composed in the language of the elite stephen houston , john robertson and david stuart have suggested that the specific variety of chʼolan found in the majority of southern lowland glyphic texts was a language they dub '' classic chʼoltiʼan '' , the ancestor language of the modern chʼortiʼ and chʼoltiʼ languages however , mora-marín has argued that traits shared by classic lowland maya and the chʼoltiʼan languages are retentions rather than innovations , and that the diversification of chʼolan in fact post-dates the classic period grenoble & whaley ( 1998 ) characterized the situation this way : '' mayan languages typically have several hundreds of thousands of speakers , and a majority of mayas speak a mayan language as a first language as maya archaeology advanced during the 20th century and nationalist and ethnic-pride-based ideologies spread , the mayan-speaking peoples began to develop a shared ethnic identity as maya , the heirs of the maya civilization '' the word '' maya '' was likely derived from the postclassical yucatán city of mayapan ; its more restricted meaning in pre-colonial and colonial times points to an origin in a particular region of the yucatán peninsula '' this pride in unity has led to an insistence on the distinctions of different mayan languages , some of which are so closely related that they could easily be referred to as dialects of a single language but , given that the term '' dialect '' has been used by some with racism overtones in the past , as scholars made a spurious distinction between amerindian '' dialects '' and european '' languages '' , the preferred usage in mesoamerica in recent years has been to designate the linguistic varieties spoken by different ethnic group as separate languages in guatemala , matters such as developing standardized orthographies for the mayan languages are governed by the academia de lenguas mayas de guatemala ( almg ; guatemalan academy of mayan languages ) , which was founded by maya organisations in 1986 following the 1996 peace accords , it has been gaining a growing recognition as the regulatory authority on mayan languages both among mayan scholars and the maya peoples writing in 1997 , lyle campbell , an expert in mayan languages and historical linguistics , argued that the most promising proposal is the '' macro-mayan '' hypothesis , which posits links between mayan , the mixe–zoque languages and the totonacan languages , but more research is needed to support or disprove this hypothesis the chʼolan languages were formerly widespread throughout the maya area , but today the language with most speakers is chʼol , spoken by 130,000 in chiapas its closest relative , the chontal maya language , chontal maya is not to be confused with the tequistlatecan languages that are referred to as '' chontal of oaxaca '' it was previously also spoken in the extreme west of honduras and el salvador , but the salvadorian variant is now extinct and the honduran one is considered moribund the closest relatives of the chʼolan languages are the languages of the tzeltalan branch , tzotzil and tzeltal , both spoken in chiapas by large and stable or growing populations ( 265,000 for tzotzil and 215,000 for tzeltal ) the region of qʼanjobalan speakers in guatemala , due to genocidal policies during the civil war and its close proximity to the mexican border , was the source of a number of refugees thus there are now small qʼanjobʼal , jakaltek , and akatek populations in various locations in mexico , the united states ( such as tuscarawas county , ohio and los angeles , california , and , through postwar resettlement , other parts of guatemala ) is spoken by almost 100,000 in several municipalities jakaltek is spoken in the municipios of jacaltenango , la democracia , concepción , san antonio huista and santa ana huista , and in parts of the nentón municipio chuj is spoken by 40,000 people in huehuetenango , and by 9,500 people , primarily refugees , over the border in mexico , in the municipality of la trinitaria , chiapas , and the villages of tziscau and cuauhtémoc qʼeqchiʼ ( sometimes spelled kekchi ) , which constitutes its own sub-branch within quichean–mamean , is spoken by about 800,000 people in the southern petén , izabal and alta verapaz departments of guatemala , and also in belize by 9,000 speakers the uspantek language , which also springs directly from the quichean–mamean node , is native only to the uspantán municipio in the department of el quiché , and has 3,000 speakers within the quichean sub-branch kʼicheʼ language , the mayan language with the largest number of speakers , is spoken by around 1,000,000 kʼicheʼ maya in the guatemalan highlands , around the towns of chichicastenango and quetzaltenango and in the cuchumatán mountains , as well as by urban emigrants in guatemala city yucatec maya ( known simply as '' maya '' to its speakers ) is the most commonly spoken mayan language in mexico the other three yucatecan languages are mopan , spoken by around 10,000 speakers primarily in belize ; itzaʼ , an extinct or moribund language from guatemala 's petén basin ; there were only 12 remaining native speakers in 1986 according to gordon , raymond g it has been suggested that proto-mayan was a tonal language , based on the fact that four different contemporary mayan languages have tone ( yucatec , uspantek , san bartolo tzotzil mistakenly writes tzeltal for tzotzil , states that the reports of a fully developed tone contrast in san bartolome tzotzil are inaccurate and mochoʼ ) , but since these languages each can be shown to have innovated tone in different ways , campbell considers this unlikely the cordemex contains a lengthy introduction on the history , importance , and key resources of written yucatec maya , including a summary of the orthography used by the project ( pp subsequently , the guatemalan academy of mayan languages ( known by its spanish acronym almg ) , founded in 1986 , adapted these standards to 22 mayan languages ( primarily in guatemala ) the script is largely phonemic , but abandoned the distinction between the apostrophe for ejective consonants and the glottal stop , so that ejective and the non-ejective sequence ( previously tʼ and t7 ) are both written tʼ josephe dechicchis , '' revisiting an imperfection in mayan orthography '' , journal of policy studies 37 ( march 2011 ) other major maya languages , primarily in the mexican state of chiapas , such as tzotzil , tzeltal , chʼol , and tojolabʼal , are not generally included in this reformation , and are sometimes written with the conventions standardized by the chiapan '' state center for indigenous language , art , and literature '' ( celali ) , which for instance writes '' ts '' rather than '' tz '' ( thus tseltal and tsotsil ) it is likely that other kinds of literature were written in perishable media such as codices made of bark , only four of which have survived the ravages of time and the campaign of destruction by spanish missionaries because indigenous languages were excluded from the education systems of mexico and guatemala after independence , mayan peoples remained largely illiterate in their native languages , learning to read and write in spanish , if at all however , since the establishment of the cordemex and the guatemalan academy of mayan languages ( 1986 ) , native language literacy has begun to spread and a number of indigenous writers have started a new tradition of writing in mayan languages notable among this new generation is the kʼicheʼ poet humberto akʼabʼal , whose works are often published in dual-language spanish/kʼicheʼ editions , as well as kʼicheʼ scholar luis enrique sam colop ( 1955–2011 ) whose translations of the popol vuh into both spanish and modern kʼicheʼ achieved high acclaim the guatemalan academy of mayan languages – spanish/mayan site , the primary authority on mayan languages corpus of maya hieroglyphic inscriptions program at the peabody museum of archaeology and ethnology , harvard university corpus of maya hieroglyphic inscriptions , volumes 1–9 published by the peabody museum press and distributed by harvard university press swadesh lists for mayan languages ( from wiktionary 's swadesh-list appendix ) mayan languages and linguistics books from cholsamaj online bibliography of mayan languages at the university of texas universidad autonoma de yucatan mayan-spanish dictionary ( spanish )
