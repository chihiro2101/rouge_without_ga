prior to 1892 , the drop was between four and ten feet ( about one to three metres ) , depending on the weight of the body , and was calculated to deliver a force of 1,260 lbf ( 5,600 newtons or 572 kgf ) , which fractured the neck at either the 2nd and 3rd or 4th and 5th cervical vertebrae a type of hanging comparable to full suspension hanging may be obtained by self-strangulation using a ligature around the neck and the partial weight of the body ( partial suspension ) to tighten the ligature the proper , traditional past tense and past participle form of the verb '' hang '' , in this sense , is ( to be ) '' hanged '' before 1850 , the short drop was the standard method of hanging , and is still common in suicides and extrajudicial hangings ( such as lynchings and summary executions ) which do not benefit from the specialised equipment and official table of drops used in the newer methods this method was later also adopted by the successor states , most notably by czechoslovakia ; where the '' pole '' method was used as the single type of execution from 1918 until the abolition of capital punishment in 1990 the short drop is a method of hanging performed by placing the condemned prisoner on a raised support such as a stool , ladder , cart , or other vehicle , with the noose around the neck the decapitation of eva dugan during a botched hanging in 1930 led the state of arizona to switch to the gas chamber as its primary execution method , on the grounds that it was believed more humane a short drop variant is the austro-hungarian '' pole '' method , called würgegalgen ( literally : strangling gallows ) , in which the following steps take place : the condemned is made to stand before a specialized vertical pole or pillar , approximately 3 metres in height those who survive a suicide-via-hanging attempt , whether due to breakage of the cord or ligature point , or being discovered and cut down , face a range of serious injuries , including cerebral anoxia ( which can lead to permanent brain damage ) , laryngeal fracture , cervical spine fracture ( which may cause paralysis ) , tracheal fracture , pharyngeal laceration , and carotid artery injury . the careful placement of the eye or knot of the noose ( so that the head was jerked back as the rope tightened ) contributed to breaking the neck partial suspension or partial weight-bearing on the ligature is sometimes used , particularly in prisons , mental hospitals or other institutions , where full suspension support is difficult to devise , because high ligature points ( e.g the german physician gottlob schober ( 1670–1739 ) , who worked in russia from 1712 , notes that a person could hang from the ribs for about three days prior to expiring , his primary pain being that of extreme thirst
