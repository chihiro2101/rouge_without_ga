in non-photosynthetic eukaryotes such as animals , insects , fungi , and protozoa , as well as the α-proteobacteria group of bacteria , the committed step for porphyrin biosynthesis is the formation of aminolevulinic acid ( δ-ala , 5-ala or dala ) by the reaction of the amino acid glycine with succinyl-coa from the citric acid cycle the inversion of one of the pyrrolic subunits in the macrocyclic ring resulted to face one of the nitrogen atom outside of the core of the macrocycle image : tetratolylporphyrin.jpg thumb right brilliant crystals of meso-tetratolylporphyrin , prepared from 4-methylbenzaldehyde and pyrrole in refluxing propionic acid one of the most common syntheses for porphyrins is the rothemund reaction , first reported in 1936 , which is also the basis for more recent methods described by adler and longo replacement of two of the four pyrrolic subunits with pyrrolinic subunits results in either a bacteriochlorin ( as found in some photosynthetic bacteria ) or an isobacteriochlorin , depending on the relative positions of the reduced rings porphyrins have been evaluated in the context of photodynamic therapy ( pdt ) since they strongly absorb light , which is then converted to energy and heat in the illuminated areas a schematic equation for these syntheses is shown : : h 2 porphyrin + ml n 2+ → m ( porphyrinate ) l n−4 + 4 l + 2 h + , where m metal ion and l a ligand a porphyrin without a metal-ion in its cavity is a free base file : porphyrin.svg porphin is the simplest porphyrin , a rare compound of theoretical interest a benzoporphyrin is a porphyrin with a benzene ring fused to one of the pyrrole units phthalocyanines , which are structurally related to porphyrins , are used in commerce as dyes and catalysts , but porphyrins are not in plants , algae , bacteria ( except for the α-proteobacteria group ) and archaea , it is produced from glutamic acid via glutamyl-trna and glutamate-1-semialdehyde intermediates are used in different species to form particular substances , but , in humans , the main end-product protoporphyrin ix is combined with iron to form heme an example of a host–guest complex that was constructed from a macrocycle composed of four porphyrins complexes with mn , fe , and co catalyze a variety of reactions of potential interest in organic synthesis abelsonite is possibly the only geoporphyrin mineral , as it is rare for porphyrins to occur in isolation and form crystals doi:10.1111/j.1751-1097.2009.00589.x these high reactive oxygen species react with susceptible cellular organic biomolecules such as ; lipids , aromatic amino acids , and nucleic acid heterocyclic bases , to produce oxidative radicals that damage the cell , possibly inducing apoptosis or even necrosis this interaction produces the formation of a highly reactive oxygen species ( ros ) , usually singlet oxygen , as well as superoxide anion , free hydroxyl radical , or hydrogen peroxide a geoporphyrin , also known as a petroporphyrin , is a porphyrin of geologic origin
