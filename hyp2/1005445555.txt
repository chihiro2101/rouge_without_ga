pinch effect , bennet , 1934 ) at the end of the nineteenth century , birkeland proposed ( backed by extensive data ) that electric currents flowing down along the earth 's magnetic fields into the atmosphere caused the aurora and polar magnetic disturbances his theoretical work on field-aligned electric currents in the aurora ( based on earlier work by kristian birkeland ) was confirmed in 1967 , these currents now being known as birkeland currents '' alfvén was also interested in problems in cosmology and all aspects of auroral physics , and used schröder 's well known book on aurora , das phänomen des polarlichts but alfvén himself noted that astrophysical textbooks poorly represented known plasma phenomena : a study of how a number of the most used textbooks in astrophysics treat important concepts such as double layers , critical velocity , pinch effects , and circuits is made alfvén worked in the departments of electrical engineering at both the university of california , san diego and the university of southern california alfvén 's work was disputed for many years by the senior scientist in space physics , the british mathematician and geophysics sydney chapman
