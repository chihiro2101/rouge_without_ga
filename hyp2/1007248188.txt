sinkholes may capture surface drainage from running or standing water , but may also form in high and dry places in specific locations the formation of sinkholes involves natural processes of erosion or gradual removal of slightly soluble bedrock ( such as limestone ) by percolation water , the collapse of a cave roof , or a lowering of the water table for example , groundwater may dissolve the carbonate cement holding the sandstone particles together and then carry away the lax particles , gradually forming a void in the case of exceptionally large sinkholes , such as the minyé sinkhole in papua new guinea or cedar sink at mammoth cave national park in kentucky , an underground stream or river may be visible across its bottom flowing from one side to the other sinkholes are common where the rock below the land surface is limestone or other carbonate rock , halite , or in other soluble rocks , such as gypsum , that can be dissolved naturally by circulating ground water collapses , commonly incorrectly labeled as sinkholes also occur due to human activity , such as the collapse of abandoned mines and salt cavern storage in salt domes in places like louisiana , mississippi and texas some sinkholes form when the land surface is changed , such as when industrial and runoff-storage ponds are created ; the substantial weight of the new material can trigger a collapse of the roof of an existing void or cavity in the subsurface , resulting in development of a sinkhole geological survey notes that '' it is a frightening thought to imagine the ground below your feet or house suddenly collapsing and forming a big hole in the ground soil-collapse sinkholes , which are characterized by the collapse of cavities in soil that have developed where soil falls down into underlying rock cavities , pose the most serious hazards to life and property some induced sinkholes are preceded by warning signs , such as cracks , sagging , jammed doors , or cracking noises , but others develop with little or no warning the most likely locations for sinkhole collapse are areas where there is already a high density of existing sinkholes in karst areas the traditional foundation evaluations ( bearing capacity and settlement ) of the ability of soil to support a structure must be supplemented by geotechnical site investigation for cavities and defects in the underlying rock since the soil/rock surface in karst areas are very irregular the number of subsurface samples ( borings and core samples ) required per unit area is usually much greater than in non-karst areas the greatest amount of karst sinkhole damage in the united states occurs in florida , texas , alabama , missouri , kentucky , tennessee , and pennsylvania the largest recent sinkhole in the usa is possibly one that formed in 1972 in montevallo , alabama as a result of man-made lowering of the water level in a nearby rock quarry their formation is facilitated by high groundwater flow , often caused by high rainfall ; such rainfall causes formation of the giant sinkholes in the nakanaï mountains , on the new britain island in papua new guinea in such conditions , the largest known sinkholes of the world have formed , like the deep xiaozhai tiankeng ( chongqing , china ) , giant sótanos in querétaro and san luis potosí states in mexico and others unusual processes have formed the enormous sinkholes of sistema zacatón in tamaulipas ( mexico ) , where more than 20 sinkholes and other karst formations have been shaped by volcanically heated , acidic groundwater this has produced not only the formation of the deepest water-filled sinkhole in the world—zacatón—but also unique processes of travertine sedimentation in upper parts of sinkholes , leading to sealing of these sinkholes with travertine lids state of florida in north america is known for having frequent sinkhole collapses , especially in the central part of the state the maya civilization sometimes used sinkholes in the yucatán peninsula ( known as cenotes ) as places to deposit precious items and human sacrifices some of the most spectacular are the zacatón cenote in mexico ( the world 's deepest water-filled sinkhole ) , the boesmansgat sinkhole in south africa , sarisariñama tepuy in venezuela , the sótano del barro in mexico , and in the town of mount gambier , south australia sinkholes that form in coral reefs and islands that collapse to enormous depths are known as blue holes and often become popular diving spots the dark color of the water is caused by a layer of phototropic microorganisms concentrated in a dense , purple colored layer at depth ; this layer '' swallows '' the light blue holes – this name was initially given to the deep underwater sinkholes of the bahamas but is often used for any deep water-filled pits formed in carbonate rocks the name originates from the deep blue color of water in these sinkholes , which is created by the high clarity of the water and the great depth of the sinkholes ; only the deep blue color of the visible spectrum can penetrate such depth and return after reflection tiankengs – these are extremely large sinkholes , typically deeper and wider than , with mostly vertical walls , most often created by the collapse of caverns this large vertical hole is not a true sinkhole , as it did not form via the dissolution of limestone , dolomite , marble , or any other water-soluble rock instead , they are examples of '' piping pseudokarst '' , created by the collapse of large cavities that had developed in the weak , crumbly quaternary volcanic deposits underlying the city the baatara gorge sinkhole and the baatara gorge waterfall next to tannourine in lebanon dashiwei tiankeng in guangxi , china , is deep , with vertical walls shaanxi tiankeng cluster , in the daba mountains of southern shaanxi , china , covers an area of nearly 5019 square kilometers with the largest sinkhole being 520 meters in diameter and 320 meters deep teiq sinkhole ( taiq , teeq , tayq ) in oman is one of the largest sinkholes in the world by volume : hranice abyss , moravia , czech republic , is the deepest known underwater cave in the world , the lowest confirmed depth ( as of 27 september 2016 ) is 473 m ( 404 m below the water level ) at the bottom of an conical pit , and approximately deep , it is among the deepest sinkholes in the world ( see sótano del barro below ) the sinkhole , which is located in an area of karst bedrock , is approximately in diameter and deep with many mature trees growing on the floor of the hole the surface entrance is only 80 feet ( 24 m ) in diameter , it expands to a diameter of 130 feet ( 40 m ) at the bottom several sinkholes have formed , the most recent in 2008 with a maximum diameter of and maximum depth of us geological survey water science school page about sinkholes daily telegraph slide show of 31 sinkholes video of sinkhole forming in texas ( 8 may 2008 ) google map of deepest '' hole '' for each state ( andy martin ) tennessee sinkholes 54,000+ sinkholes
