the sponsors of both the banking act of 1933 and the glass–steagall act of 1932 were southern democrats : senator carter glass of virginia ( who by 1932 had served in the house or the senate , or as the secretary of the treasury for the preceding 30 years ) ; and representative henry b between 1930 and 1932 , senator carter glass ( d-va ) introduced several versions of a bill ( known in each version as the glass bill ) to regulate or prohibit the combination of commercial and investment banking and to establish other reforms ( except deposit insurance ) similar to the final provisions of the 1933 banking act although the deposit insurance provisions of the 1933 banking act were very controversial , and drew veto threats from president franklin delano roosevelt , president roosevelt supported the glass–steagall provisions separating commercial and investment banking , and representative steagall included those provisions in his house bill that differed from senator glass 's senate bill primarily in its deposit insurance provisions while supporters of the glass–steagall separation of commercial and investment banking cite the pecora investigation as supporting that separation , perino 2010 glass–steagall critics have argued that the evidence from the pecora investigation did not support the separation of commercial and investment banking the previous glass bills before the final revision all had similar goals and brought up the same objectives , which were to separate commercial from investment banking , bring more banking activities under federal reserve supervision , and to allow branch banking in may 1933 , steagall 's addition of allowing state-chartered banks to receive federal deposit insurance and shortening the time in which banks needed to eliminate securities affiliates to one year was known as the driving force of what helped the glass–steagall act to be signed into law together , they prevented commercial federal reserve member banks from : dealing in non-governmental securities for customers investing in non-investment grade securities for themselves underwriting or distributing non-governmental securities affiliating ( or sharing employees ) with companies involved in such activities conversely , glass–steagall prevented securities firms and investment banks from taking deposits whereas a federal reserve member bank could not buy , sell , underwrite , or deal in any security except as specifically permitted by section 16 , such a bank could affiliate with a company so long as that company was not '' engaged principally '' in such activities starting in 1987 , the federal reserve board interpreted this to mean a member bank could affiliate with a securities firm so long as that firm was not '' engaged principally '' in securities activities prohibited for a bank by section 16 by the time the glba repealed the glass–steagall affiliation restrictions , the federal reserve board had interpreted this '' loophole '' in those restrictions to mean a banking company ( citigroup , as owner of citibank ) could acquire one of the world 's largest securities firms ( salomon smith barney ) by defining commercial banks as banks that take in deposits and make loans and investment banks as banks that underwrite and deal with securities the glass–steagall act explained the separation of banks by stating that commercial banks could not deal with securities and investment banks could not own commercial banks or have close connections with them although most of these interpretations were overturned by court decisions , by the late 1970s bank regulators began issuing glass–steagall interpretations that were upheld by courts and that permitted banks and their affiliates to engage in an increasing variety of securities activities economics nobel memorial laureate joseph stiglitz , for instance , argued that '' when repeal of glass-steagall brought investment and commercial banks together , the investment-bank culture came out on top '' , and banks which had previously been managed conservatively turned to riskier investments to increase their returns white , for instance , noted that '' it was not commercial banks ' investment banking activities , such as underwriting and dealing in securities , that did them in '' glass–steagall act & nbsp ; – further readings on the systematic dismemberment of the act from pbs 's frontline full text of the glass–steagall act followed by new york federal reserve bank explanation glass subcommittee hearings pecora investigation hearings fdic history : 1933-1983 1987 federal reserve bank of kansas city jackson hole symposium on restructuring the financial system public law 73-66 , 73d congress , h.r 5661 : an act to provide for the safer and more effective use of the assets of banks , to regulate interbank control , to prevent the undue diversion of funds into speculative operations the southeast missourian , march 10 , 1933 details legislative debate when passing the bill
