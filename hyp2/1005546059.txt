other special factors that are often considered are : development of the minor pieces , rooks on open files or the seventh rank , doubled rooks , outpost knights ( knights in central locations protected by a pawn and not subject to attack by an opposing pawn ) , possession of the bishop pair , bishops on the long diagonals , pieces occupying or bearing on spaces around the opposing king , and mobility of the kings ( kings should n't be 'cramped ' , hence subject to mate-on-the-move ) not just the absolute value of the material , but also the ratio between white and black material matters : sacrificing a pawn in the opening may confer a positional advantage ( the material ratio is scarcely affected ) , but the plus of a pawn in a king and pawn end game is usually sufficient to win ( ratio of material is large ) the terms composing some factors , like king safety , combine non-linearly - one weakness in king safety , like an open file adjacent to the king , may be penalized for example , by 1/4 pawn , but two weaknesses may need to be penalized one or even two full pawns , and three weaknesses by a piece , a rook or even more because checkmate is becoming a likely possibility the typical pawn-multiple values assigned to the pieces are n't constant either , but depend on context : undeveloped pieces are worth far less as are pieces with reduced mobility for any reason : bishops confined by their own pawns ( '' the bad bishop '' ) ; knights lose value as the position is cleared of pieces , and bishops and rooks gain value ; queens are worth substantially more if the opposing king is n't sheltered against checks evaluation functions in chess consist of a material balance term that dominates the evaluation , plus a set of positional terms usually totaling no more than the value of a pawn , though in some positions the positional terms can get much larger , such as when checkmate is imminent authors of chess programs tend to keep the composition of their piece-square tables , as well as the methods used to create them , secret , because a great deal of time , effort , testing and playing experience go into constructing them , and careful tuning here offers a competitive advantage in monte-carlo tree search , the search space of all variations from a node is sampled by rolling out , or playing the game to the end by alternately choosing a random move for each side the weakness of such a scheme is that the strongest line ( s ) of play for each side may not be part of that opening - they may be narrow opportunities in an opening which is otherwise weak for example , knights are seldom found on left and right edges of the board in master games , so one may assign a penalty value to those spaces of the knight piece-square table proportionate to how seldom a knight is found there in master games ' the mobility score is the number of legal moves available to a player , or alternately the sum of the number of spaces attacked or defended by each piece , including spaces occupied by friendly or opposing pieces in the endgame , it is possible to construct positions where whoever moves , wins , though the position is otherwise in balance ; it is also possible to construct positions where whoever must move , loses ( zugzwang ) toward this end , exemplary positions from master games are employed , and the efficacy of the evaluation function measured by the percentage of moves selected that agree with the choices of the masters
