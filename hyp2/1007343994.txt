it is classically described that there are three sites in the ureter where a kidney stone will commonly become stuck : where the ureter meets the renal pelvis ; where the iliac blood vessels cross the ureters ; and where the ureters enter the urinary bladder , however a retrospective case study , which is a primary source , of where stones lodged based on medical imaging did not show many stones at the place where the iliac blood vessels cross when pain is caused , for example by spasm of the ureters or by a stone , the referred pain to the dermatomes of t11 - l2 , namely the back and sides of the abdomen , the scrotum ( males ) or labia majora ( females ) and upper part of the front of the thigh this plexus is formed from a number of nerve root directly ( t9-12 , l1 , and s2-4 ) , as well as branches from other nerve plexuses and nerves ; specifically , the upper third of the ureter receives nerve branches from the renal plexus and aortic plexus , the middle part receives branches from the upper hypogastric plexus and nerve , and the lower ureter receives branches from the lower hypogastric plexus and nerve if a concerning lesion is seen , a flexible camera may be inserted into the ureters , called ureteroscopy , in order to view the lesion and take a biopsy , and a ct scan will be performed of other body parts ( a full-body ct scan ) to look for additional lesions the word '' ureter '' comes from the ancient greek stem '' uro '' relating to urination , and the first use of the word is seen during the era of hippocrates to refer to the urethra ureteral cancer is most often due to cancer of the cells lining the ureter , called transitional cell carcinoma , although it can more rarely occur as a squamous cell carcinoma if the type of cells lining the urethra have changed due to chronic inflammation , such as due to stones or schistosomiasis a kidney stone can move from the kidney and become lodged inside the ureter , which can block the flow of urine , as well as cause a sharp cramp in the back , side , or lower abdomen if surgery is considered , it generally involves reattaching the ureters to a different spot on the bladder , and extending the part of the ureter that it is within the wall of the bladder , with the most common surgical option being cohen 's cross-trigonal reimplantation it was only in the 1550s that anatomists such as bartolomeo eustacchio and jacques dubois began to use the terms to specifically and consistently refer to what is in modern english called the ureter and the urethra if the ureters have been resited as a result of surgery , for example due to a kidney transplant or due to past surgery for vesicuureteric reflux , that site may also become narrowed dye may also be injected directly into the ureters or renal tract ; an antegrade pyelogram is when contrast is injected directly into the renal pelvis , and a retrograde pyelogram is where dye is injected into the urinary tract via a catheter , and flows backwards into the ureters venous drainage mostly parallels that of the arterial supply ; that is , it begins as a network of smaller veins in the adventitia ; with the renal veins draining the upper ureters , and the vesicular and gonadal veins draining the lower ureters these include partial or total duplication of the ureter ( a duplex ureter ) , or the formation of a second irregularly placed ureter ; or where the junction with the bladder is malformed or a ureterocoele develops ( usually in that location ) a number of forms of medical imaging are available for diagnosis of the condition , with modalities including doppler urinary tract ultrasound , mag 3 nuclear medicine scaning , and a micturition urethrocystogram investigations performed usually include collecting a sample of urine for an inspection for malignant cells under a microscope , called cytology , as well as medical imaging by a ct urogram or ultrasound the urinary tract including the ureters , as well as their function to drain urine from the kidneys , has been described by galen in the second century ad hryntshalk in 1929 pioneered the development of the intravenous urogram , in which contrast is injected into a vein and highlights the kidney and , when excreted , the urinary tract all vertebrates have two kidneys located behind the abdomen that produce urine , and have a way of excreting it , so that waste products within the urine can be removed from the body the ureter is lined by urothelium , a type of transitional epithelium that is capable of responding to stretches in the ureters when cancer is present , the most common symptom in an affected person is blood in the urine ; it may not cause symptoms , and a physical medical examination may be otherwise normal , except in late disease more invasive forms of imaging include ureteroscopy , which is the insertion of a flexible endoscope into the urinary tract to view the ureters this condition can be associated with urinary tract infections , particularly in children , and is present in up to 28â€“36 % of children to some degree the lower third of the ureter , closest to the bladder , is supplied by branches from the internal iliac artery , mainly the superior and inferior vesical arteries the arterial supply can be variable , with arteries that contribute include the middle rectal artery , branches directly from the aorta , and , in women , the uterine and vaginal arteries more useful images were able to be produced when edwin hurry fenwick in 1908 pioneered the use of tubes covered in material visible to x-rays inserted into the ureters , and in the early 20th century when contrasts were injected externally into the urinary tract ( retrograde pyelograms ) after the cancer is staged , treatment may involve open surgery to remove the affected ureter and kidney if it is involved ; or , if the lesion is small , it may be removed via ureteroscopy
