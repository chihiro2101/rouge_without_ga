with the antagonism of the european powers mounting , and smarting from her humiliation by the austrians at the bosnian crisis , russia sought to gain the upper hand by creating a russophile '' slavic block '' in the balkans , directed both against austria-hungary and the ottomans in essence , serbia was forced to exchange macedonia for albania , an issue that would play a key role in the eventual dissolution of the league in the spring of 1913 , when the great powers insisted upon the creation of the albanian state and denied serbia its territorial gains in that direction after the successful coup d'Ã©tat for the incorporation of eastern rumelia , bulgaria had orchestrated a methodical scenario of indirect expansion through the creation , in the multi-ethnic ottoman-held macedonia ( for many centuries an administrative rather than a nationalistic name ) , of a united , liberating and revolutionary organization , the imro , allegedly without national color in fact , it was a bulgarian-backed organization created with the secret agenda of facilitating the incorporation of thrace ( eastern and western ) and macedonia ( aegean and the vardar ) into a new autonomous state , as an intermediate step before unification with bulgaria could take place in the same way as with eastern rumelia in greece , army officers had revolted in august 1909 and secured the appointment of a progressive government under eleftherios venizelos , which they hoped would resolve the cretan issue in greece 's favour and reverse their defeat of 1897 at the hands of the ottomans the entry of greece in the league however was essential for the allies , since greece , alone among the balkan states in possessing a major fleet , could preclude the mass transfer of ottoman reinforcements from asia directly into europe by sea these developments did not go unnoticed by the great powers , but although there was an official consensus between the european powers over the eastern question of the ottoman empire , which led to a stern warning to the balkan states , unofficially each of them took a different diplomatic approach due to their conflicting interests in the area as a result , any possible preventative effect of the common official warning was canceled by the mixed unofficial signals , and failed to prevent the outbreak of hostilities : russia was a prime mover in the establishment of the league and saw it as an essential tool in case of a future war against russia 's rival , the austro-hungarian empire but it was unaware of the bulgarian plans over thrace and constantinople , territories on which russia had long-held ambitions , and on which it had just secured a secret agreement of expansion from its allies france and britain , as a reward in participating in the upcoming world war i against the central powers france , not feeling ready for a war against germany in 1912 , took a totally negative position against the league , firmly informing its ally russia that it would not take part in a potential conflict between russia and austro-hungary if it resulted from the actions of the balkan league germany , already heavily involved in the internal ottoman politics , officially opposed a war against the empire , but in its effort to win bulgaria for the central powers , and seeing the inevitability of ottoman disintegration , was playing with the idea to replace the balkan positions of the ottomans with a friendly greater bulgaria in its san stefano borders , an idea that was based on the german origin of the bulgarian king and his anti-russian sentiments defeat turned bulgaria into its participation in the first world war on the side of the central powers , since its balkan enemies ( serbia , greece and romania ) were involved in the war on the side of the entente with the outbreak of world war i and the entente 's intervention in macedonia , the conflict between king and first minister steadily deteriorated , leading eventually to the national schism , that greatly contributed to the loss of the next war against kemalist turkey in asia minor , and dominated greek politics for over a half of a century
