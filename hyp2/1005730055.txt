the voice coil produces a varying magnetic field , which works against the fixed magnetic field of a magnet around which the cylindrical voice coil is suspended , forcing the voice coil and the diaphragm attached to it to move since the coil is attached to a diaphragm , the vibratory motion of the voice coil transmits to the diaphragm ; the diaphragm in turn vibrates the air , thus creating air motions or audio waves , which is heard as high sounds among the challenges in tweeter design and manufacture are : providing adequate damping , to stop the dome 's motion rapidly when the signal ends ; ensuring suspension linearity , allowing high output at the low end of its frequency range ; ensuring freedom from contact with the magnet assembly , keeping the dome centered as it moves ; and providing adequate power handling without adding excessive mass the separation from the baffle is considered to be optimal under the theory that the smallest baffle possible is optimal for tweeters most tweeters are designed to reproduce frequencies up to the formally defined upper limit of the human hearing range ( typically listed as 20 & nbsp ; khz ) ; some operate at frequencies up to approximately in between 5khz to 20khz tweeters with a greater upper range have been designed for psychoacoustic testing , for extended-range digital audio such as super audio cd intended for audiophiles , for biologists performing research on animal response to sounds , and for ambient sound systems in zoos ribbon tweeters have been made that can reproduce 80 & nbsp ; khz and even 100 & nbsp ; khz ferrofluid is a suspension of very small ( typically 10 & nbsp ; nm ) iron oxide magnetic particles in a very low volatility liquid , typically a synthetic oil the diaphragm is glued to a voice coil former , typically made from a different material from the dome , since it must cope with heat without tearing or significant dimensional change the suspension may be a continuation of the diaphragm and is glued to a mounting ring , which may fit into a groove , over locating pins , or be fastened with machine screws the diaphragm is generally shaped like an inverted dome and loads into a series of tapered channels in a central structure called a phase plug , which equalizes the path length between various areas of the diaphragm and the horn throat , preventing acoustic cancellations between different points on the diaphragm surface , paper , silk or coated fabric ) or both ; a suspension ( or spider ) that is stiffer than for other drivers—less flexibility is needed for high frequency reproduction ; small voice coils ( 3/4 inch is typical ) and light ( thin ) wire , which also helps the tweeter cone move rapidly cone tweeters today are often relatively cheap , but many of those in the past were of high quality , such as those made by audax/polydax , bozak , cts , jbl , tonegen and seas during the 1970s and 1980s , the widespread introduction of higher quality audiophile discs and the advent of the cd caused the cone tweeter to fall out of popularity because cone tweeters seldom extend past 15 & nbsp ; khz a dome tweeter is constructed by attaching a voice coil to a dome ( made of woven fabric , thin metal or other suitable material ) , which is attached to the magnet or the top plate via a low compliance suspension dome tweeters are categorized by their voice coil diameter , and range from 19 & nbsp ; mm ( 0.75 & nbsp ; in ) , through 38 & nbsp ; mm ( 1.5 & nbsp ; in ) the overwhelming majority of dome tweeters presently used in hi-fi speakers are 25 & nbsp ; mm ( 1 & nbsp ; in ) in diameter in addition , a permanently polarized material such as quartz ( sio 2 ) or barium titanate ( batio 3 ) will produce an electric field when the material changes dimensions as a result of an imposed mechanical force piezo tweeters rarely get used in high-end audio because of their low fidelity , although they did feature in some high-end designs of the late ‘ 70s , such as the celef pe1 in which they were utilised as a super tweeter in combination with a conventional dome tweeter a ribbon tweeter uses a very thin diaphragm ( often of aluminum , or perhaps metalized plastic film ) that supports a planar coil frequently made by deposition of aluminium vapor , suspended in a powerful magnetic field ( typically provided by neodymium magnets ) to reproduce high frequencies this type of speaker employs a thin diaphragm ( generally plastic and typically pet film ) , with a thin conductive coating , suspended between two screens or perforated metal sheets , referred to as stators the output of the driving amplifier is applied to the primary of a step-up transformer with a center-tapped secondary , and a very high voltage—several hundred to several thousand volts—is applied between the center tap of the transformer and the diaphragm when an audio signal is applied to the primary of the transformer , the stators are electrically driven 180 degrees out of phase , alternately attracting and repelling the diaphragm an uncommon way of driving an electrostatic speaker without a transformer is to connect the plates of a push-pull vacuum tube amplifier directly to the stators , and the high voltage supply between the diaphragm and ground the design is quite old ( the original patents date to the 1930s ) , but occupies a very small segment of the market because of high costs , low efficiency , large size for full range designs , and fragility the tweeter in either case is usually termed a compression driver and is quite different from more common types of tweeters ( see above ) poorly designed horns , or improperly crossed-over horns , have predictable problems in the accuracy of their output , and the load that they present to the amplifier they are more complex than other tweeters ( plasma generation is not required in other types ) , but offer the advantage that the moving mass is optimally low , and so very responsive to the signal input
