it was first proposed by an illinois attorney , luis kutner , in a speech to the euthanasia society of america in 1967 benzenhöfer , u , hack-molitor , g ( 2009 ) , when no longer available to speak for himself or herself ) and devised a way for an individual to express their health care desires when no longer able to express current healthcare wishes because this form of '' will '' was to be used while an individual was still alive ( but no longer able to make decisions ) it was dubbed the '' living will '' went into effect in december 1991 , and required healthcare providers ( primarily hospitals , nursing homes and home health agencies ) to give patients information about their rights to make advance directives under state law it may also be used to express wishes about the use or foregoing of food and water , if supplied via tubes or other medical devices an example of a statement sometimes found in a living will is : '' if i suffer an incurable , irreversible illness , disease , or condition and my attending physician determines that my condition is terminal , i direct that life-sustaining measures that would serve only to prolong my dying be withheld or discontinued '' more specific living wills may include information regarding an individual 's desire for such services such as analgesia ( pain relief ) , antibiotics , hydration , feeding , and the use of ventilators or cardiopulmonary resuscitation this led to the development of what some have called '' second generation '' advance directives – the '' health care proxy appointment '' or '' medical power of attorney drawing upon these laws , '' durable powers of attorney for health care '' and '' healthcare proxy appointment '' documents were created and codified in law , allowing an individual to appoint someone to make healthcare decisions in their behalf if they should ever be rendered incapable of making their wishes known the appointed healthcare proxy has , in essence , the same rights to request or refuse treatment that the individual would have if still capable of making and communicating health care decisions the primary benefit of second-generation advance directives is that the appointed representative can make real-time decisions in actual circumstances , as opposed to advance decisions framed in hypothetical situations , as recorded in a living will the first of the third-generation advance directives was the values history by doukas and mccullough , created at the georgetown university school of medicine , first published in 1988 , and then more widely cited in an article in 1991 '' the goal of this advance directive is to move away from a focus on specific treatments and medical procedures to a focus on patient values and personal goals one persistent challenge of third generation-based values documents is to show a linkage between the elicited values and goals with medical care wishes , although studies have demonstrated that values regarding financial and psychological burden are strong motivators in not wanting a broad array of end-of-life therapies the scenarios are each associated with a roster of commonly considered medical procedures and interventions , allowing the individual to decide in advance which treatments are wanted or not wanted under the circumstances while some commentators suggest that any recording of one 's wishes is problematic , the preponderance of experts recommend the completion of an advance directive document – especially one that includes both a living will and a proxy designation confusing , and incomplete to adequately capture an individual 's wishes , and that they focus too much on the needs of medical and legal practitioners to the exclusion of the needs of patients in queensland , for example , the concept of an advance health directive is defined in the power of attorney act of 1998 and guardianship and administration act of 2000 much of the current focus in canada is on advance care planning which involves encouraging individuals to reflect on and express their wishes for future care , including end-of-life care , before they become terminally ill or incapable of making decisions for themselves a number of publicly funded initiatives exist to promote advance care planning and to encourage people to appoint '' surrogate decision-maker '' who make medical decisions and can give or withhold consent for medical procedures according to the patient's pre-expressed wishes when the patient becomes incapable of doing so themselves in 2008 , the advance care planning in canada : a national framework and implementation project was founded former federal health minister rona ambrose ( july 15 , 2013 to november 4 , 2015 ) has stated : '' i think the starting point for me is that we still do n't have the best elderly care and palliative care yet… so let 's talk about making sure we have the best end-of-life care before we start talking about assisted suicide and euthanasia this is only for an advance refusal of treatment for when the person lacks mental capacity ; to be legally binding , the advance decision must be specific about the treatment that is being refused and the circumstances in which the refusal will apply any advance refusal is legally binding providing that the patient is an adult , the patient was competent and properly informed when reaching the decision , it is clearly applicable to the present circumstances and there is no reason to believe that the patient has changed their mind if an advance decision does not meet these criteria but appears to set out a clear indication of the patient 's wishes , it will not be legally binding but should be taken into consideration in determining the patient 's best interests in june 2010 , the wealth management solicitors , moore blatch , announced that research showed demand for living wills had trebled in the two years previous , indicating the rising level of people concerned about the way in which their terminal illness will be managed for the official guidance to doctors , see : '' treatment and care towards the end of life : good practice in decision making '' in order to make their advance wishes clear , people can use a living will , which can include general statements about wishes , which are not legally binding , and specific refusals of treatment called '' advance decisions '' or '' advance directives '' such law , based on the principle of the right of self-determination , provides for the assistance of a fiduciary and of the physician in may 2008 , apparently as a result of the recent court of cassation 's holding in the case of englaro , a guardianship judge in modena , italy used relatively new legislation law no faced with a 70-year-old woman with end-stage lou gehrig 's disease who was petitioning the court ( with the support of her family ) to prevent any later use of a respirator , the judge appointed her husband as guardian with the specific duty to refuse any tracheotomy and/or respirator use if/when the patient became unable to refuse such treatment herself according to a 2017 survey by the ministry of health , labor and welfare ( mhlw ) , 66 % of surveyed individuals supported the idea of such directives , but only 8.1 % had prepared their own the private organization nihon songenshi kyōkai ( japan society for dying with dignity ) offers members a semi-standardized '' living will '' ( ribingu uiru ) form that is registered with the organization , though it holds no legal weight he or she may also designate a natural person who in the event that he or she is no longer capable of judgement should discuss the medical procedures with the attending doctor and decide on his or her behalf as more and more americans experienced the burdens and diminishing benefits of invasive and aggressive medical treatment in poor prognosis states – either directly ( themselves ) or through a loved one – pressure began to mount to devise ways to avoid the suffering and costs associated with treatments one did not want in personally untenable situations in the united states , all states recognize some form of living wills or the designation of a health care proxy the term living will is not officially recognized under california law , but an advance health care directive or durable power of attorney may be used for the same purpose as a living will in pennsylvania on november 30 , 2006 , governor edward rendell signed into law act 169 , that provides a comprehensive statutory framework governing advance health care directives and health care decision-making for incompetent patients as a result , health care organizations make available a '' combined living will & health care power of attorney example form from pennsylvania act 169 of 2006 however , in recent years some of these registries , such as the one run by the washington state department of health , have been shuttered by the state government because of low enrollment , lack of funds , or both on july 28 , 2009 , barack obama became the first united states president to announce publicly that he had a living will ,
