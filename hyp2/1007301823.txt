sovereign states that have been able to unilaterally depute certain attributes of sovereignty to larger powers in exchange for benign protection of their political and economic viability against their geographic or demographic constraints however , professor of international law maurice mendelson disputes qualifying vatican city as a state , arguing that it does not meet the '' traditional criteria of statehood '' and that the '' special status of the vatican city is probably best regarded as a means of ensuring that the pope can freely exercise his spiritual functions , and in this respect is loosely analogous to that of the headquarters of international organisations while it is agreed that microstates are the smallest of all states , there is no consensus on what variable ( or variables ) or what cut-off point should be used to determine which political units should be labelled as '' microstates '' ( as opposed to small '' normal '' states ) these types of states , often labelled as '' microstates , '' are usually located on small ( usually disputed ) territorial enclaves , generate limited economic activity founded on tourism and philatelic and numismatic sales , and are tolerated or ignored by the nations from which they claim to have seceded examples of microstates understood as modern protected states include such states as liechtenstein , san marino , monaco , niue , andorra , the cook islands or palau another is couto misto , disputed by spain and portugal , that operated as a sovereign state in its own right until the 1864 treaty of lisbon that partitioned the territory , with the largest part becoming part of spain according to some scholars the quantitative approach to defining microstates suffers from such problems as '' inconsistency , arbitrariness , vagueness and inability to meaningfully isolate qualitatively distinct political units '' some academics have suggested defining microstates according to the unique features that are linked to their geographic or demographic smallness examples of this are microstates that establish a tax haven or sell their support in international committees in exchange for military and economic support some microstates with a history as british colony have implemented some aspects of a consensus political system , to adapt to their geographic features or societal make-up some scholars have taken the statistical correlation between small size and democracy as a sign that smallness is beneficial to the development of a democratic political system , anckar , d according to the definition proposed by dumienski ( 2014 ) : '' microstates are modern protected states , i.e because of the high number of microstates that were british colonies in the past , microstates often have a majoritarian and parliamentary political system similar to the westminster system an alternative approach , that may overcome these challenges , is to define microstates as '' modern protected states ''
