ian walker , author of the most recent scholarly biography of harold godwinson , suggests that it was robert , while in exile after the return of godwin , who testified that king edward had nominated duke william to be edward 's heir 224–225 one is the so-called , actually a sacramentary with thirteen surviving full-page miniatures , which bears an inscription apparently in robert 's own hand recording its donation to jumièges when he was bishop of london , and the other the so-called , actually a pontifical with three remaining full-page miniatures and other decoration ( respectively rouen , bibliothèque municipale , manuscripts y.6 and y.7 ) 225–226 before he came to england , robert had begun the construction of a new abbey church at jumièges , in the new romanesque style which was then becoming popular , and introduced to normandy the westwork from the rhineland 219–222 robert probably influenced edward the confessor 's rebuilding of the church at westminster abbey , the first known building in the romanesque style in england , which is so described by william of malmesbury cowdrey '' robert of jumièges '' oxford dictionary of national biography robert became friendly with edward the confessor , a claimant to the english throne , while edward was living in exile in normandy , probably in the 1030s 59 robert 's treatment was used by william as one of the justifications for his invasion of england , the other being that edward had named william his heir the latter may well have been commissioned by æthelgar , robert 's predecessor as archbishop in 988–90 , although it is possible the '' archbishop robert '' of the traditional name is emma 's brother robert , archbishop of rouen from 990 to 1037 in refusing to consecrate spearhafoc , robert may have been following his own interests against the wishes of both the king and godwin , as he had his own candidate , a norman , in mind the life of saint edward claims that while godwin was in exile robert tried to persuade king edward to divorce edith , godwin 's daughter , but edward refused and instead she was sent to a abbey however , this view is contradicted by david douglas , a historian and biographer of william the conqueror , who believes that robert merely relayed edward 's decision , probably while robert was on his way to rome to receive his pallium modern historians have felt it more likely that edward , at robert 's urging , wished to divorce edith and remarry in order to have children to succeed him on the english throne , walker harold p 47 robert was declared an outlaw and deposed from his archbishopric on 14 & nbsp ; september 1052 at a royal council , mainly because the returning godwin felt that robert , along with a number of other normans , had been the driving force behind his exile 89–92 it was against this backdrop that robert refused to consecrate spearhafoc , although there is no other evidence that robert embraced the reform position , and his claim that the pope forbade the consecration may have had more to do with finding an easy excuse than any true desire for reform several medieval chroniclers , including the author of the life of saint edward , felt that the blame for edward and godwin 's conflict in 1051–1052 lay squarely with robert ; stafford queen emma and queen edith p robert was prior of the monastery of st ouen at rouen before he became abbot of the important jumièges abbey douglas william the conqueror p robert 's election had disrupted godwin 's patronage powers in canterbury , and now robert 's efforts to recover lands godwin had seized from canterbury challenged the earl 's economic rights 214 godwin was attempting to exercise his power of patronage over the archbishopric , but the king 's appointment signalled that the king was willing to contest with the earl over the traditional royal rights at canterbury 37–38 the entire history of the various missions which robert is alleged to have made is confused , and complicated by propaganda claims made by norman chroniclers after the norman conquest in 1066 , bates william the conqueror p though the winchester head remained in place , another one appeared at jumièges ; he '' must have clandestinely removed the head , or at least the greater part of it , and left his monks to venerate the empty or nearly empty capsa '' 124 with bishop ulfus normanus and bishop william of london , probably once again taking wulfnoth and hakon with him as hostages , whether with the permission of king edward or not 111 godwin and his family were exiled ; afterwards robert claimed the office of sheriff of kent , probably on the strength of eadsige , his predecessor as archbishop , having held the office 13–15 it is possible that westminster influenced the building at jumièges , as the arcade there closely resembles westminster 's arcade , both of them in a style that never became common in normandy it may have been partly to appease leo that edward appointed robert instead of æthelric , hoping to signal to the papacy that the english crown was not totally opposed to the growing reform movement but we know of some transfers to jumièges of important english church treasures , the first trickle of what was to become a flood of treasure taken to normandy after the conquest the medieval writer william of poitiers gives the same reason , but also adds that robert took with him as hostages godwin 's son wulfnoth and grandson hakon ( son of sweyn ) some norman chroniclers state that he visited normandy on this trip and informed duke william the bastard that he was the childless king edward 's heir according to these chroniclers , the decision to make william the heir had been decided at the same lenten royal council in 1051 that had declared robert archbishop by september , they were advancing on london , where negotiations between the king and the earl were conducted with the help of stigand , the bishop of winchester
