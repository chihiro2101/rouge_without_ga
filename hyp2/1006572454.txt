the approaches to the bay between the aran islands and the mainland are : north soundan súnda ó thuaidh ( more accurately bealach locha lurgan ) lies between inishmore and lettermullen , county galway little is known about the first inhabitants to cross over to the islands , but they likely came across in search of a safe haven from attack the islands ' geology is mainly karst limestone , related to the burren in county clare ( to the east ) , not the granites of connemara to the north the result is that the aran islands are one of the finest examples of a glacio-karst landscape in the world since grass will grow once the temperature rises above , this means that the island ( like the neighbouring burren ) has one of the longest growing seasons in ireland or britain , and supports diverse and rich plant growth where the surface of the pavement is shattered into gravel , many of the hardier arctic or alpine plants can be found , but when the limestone pavement is covered by a thin layer of soil , patches of grass are seen , interspersed with plants such as gentian and orchids the islands were first populated in larger numbers probably at the time of the cromwellian conquest of ireland in the mid-17th century , when the catholic population of ireland had the choice of going '' to hell or to connacht '' many fled to the numerous islands off the west coast of ireland , where they adapted themselves to the raw climatic conditions , developing a survival system of total self-sufficiency an unusually high rate of irish-language monolingualism was found among senior natives until the end of the 20th century , in large part because of the isolating nature of the traditional trades practised and the natural isolation of the islands in general from mainland ireland over the course of the islands ' history many blame the decline of irish-speaking among young members of the island community on english-language television , available since the 1960s ; furthermore , many younger islanders leave for the mainland when they come of age several bronze age and iron age forts and attractions are on the islands : dun aengus ( dún aonghasa , aran islands dialect : dūn aŋgəs ) is a bronze age and iron age fort on the edge of a cliff overlooking the atlantic ocean on inishmore since 2000 , áras éanna arts centre , inisheer , has been welcoming artists in residence , both local and international , to stay and work on the inspirational aran islands for periods of one month clíodhna lyons , born on the islands , is an irish cartoonist , animator , and printmaker , who has created several comics and 'zines and is now a director for brown bag films sketches by and of clarke exist from these trips , regarded as formative in his upbringing , as they marked the first occasions in which convalescing off the mainland of ireland was necessary for the artist beginning around the late 19th century , many irish writers traveled to the aran islands ; lady gregory , for example , came to aran in the late 19th century to learn irish at the start of the 20th century and throughout his life , one of ireland 's leading artists , seán keating , spent time every year on the islands translating onto canvas all the qualities that make the inhabitants of these atlantic islands so unusual and in many respects remarkable many wrote of their experiences in a personal vein , alternately casting them as narratives about finding , or failing to find , some essential aspect of irish culture that had been lost to the more urban regions of ireland a second , related kind of visitor was those who attempted to collect and catalogue the stories and folklore of the island , treating it as a kind of societal '' time capsule '' of an earlier stage of irish culture one might consider john millington synge 's the aran islands as a work that straddles these first two modes , it being both a personal account and also an attempt at preserving information about the pre- ( or il- ) literate aran culture in literary form they came not necessarily because of the uniquely '' irish '' nature of the island community , but simply because the accidents of geography and history conspired to produce a society that some found intriguing or even beguiling , and they wished to participate in it directly this third mode of being in aran died out in the late 1970s due in part to the increased tourist traffic and in part to technological improvements made to the island , that relegated the above aspects to history ó síocháin , a dublin author and lawyer , learning to speak gaelic to the fluency of an islander , became inextricably linked to the aran knitting and their aran sweaters , extensively promoting their popularity and sale around the world for nearly forty years a fourth kind of visitor to the islands , still prominent today , comes for spiritual reasons often connected to an appreciation for celtic christianity or more modern new age beliefs , the former of which finds sites and landscapes of importance on the islands finally , many thousands of visitors come for broadly tourism , to see the ruins , hear irish spoken ( and irish music played ) in the few pubs on the island , and to experience the often awe-inspiring geology of cliffs tourists and visitors of the fourth kind , however , are under-represented as creators of literature or art directly connected to the island ; few are ordinary '' travelogues '' of note , perhaps because of the small size of the islands , and no personal accounts are written about aran that are primarily concerned with spirituality tim robinson 's stones of aran : pilgrimage ( 1986 ) and stones of aran : labyrinth ( 1995 ) , and his accompanying detailed map of the islands , are another resource on the aran islands robinson 's work is an exhaustive , but not exhausting , survey of the aran geography and its influence on aran culture from the iron age to recent times robinson also has written , and continues to write , about the connemara region that faces the aran islands on the galway mainland the ( modern ) aran version of the lightweight boat called the currach ( aran islands dialect : kørəx , korəx ) is made from canvas stretched over a sparse skeleton of thin laths , then covered in tar more modern versions are still built for racing at the many local regattas , or cruinnithe up and down the west coast of ireland during the summer the aran islands featured in the television comedy father ted from 1995 to 1998 , set on the fictional craggy island , with real local sights such as the shipwreck of the steam trawler mv plassey in the opening sequence the play is the first in the aran islands trilogy , followed in 2001 by the lieutenant of inishmore , and the unpublished the banshees of inisheer the songs from the album man of aran by the group british sea power all relate to the aran islands
