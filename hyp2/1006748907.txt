in the early iron age , maiden castle was generally unexceptional ; it was one of over 100 & nbsp ; hill forts of similar size built around the same time in the area that is now berkshire , dorset , hampshire , and wiltshire early in the iron age , most of the pottery found at maiden castle was produced locally & nbsp ; – within about & nbsp ; – however later on sources further afield became more important , and by the late iron age 95 % of the pottery came from the area around poole harbour , more than away maiden castle had been abandoned by the end of the 1st century , a time when durnovaria ( dorchester ) rose to prominence as the civitas , or regional capital , of the durotriges , a celtic tribe whose territory was in southwest england it has been suggested that maiden castle was occupied as a roman military outpost or fort and the settlement discontinued , as there is no known fort in the area and it was not uncommon for hill forts in the southwest to have been occupied by roman forces this is supported by the possibility that the multiple rings of ditches often employed at developed hill forts ( the technical term for which is '' multivallate '' ) were likely to be not just defensive ; so many ditches and ramparts , such as those at maiden castle , were excessive for defence alone so were likely used as statements of power and authority little evidence has been discovered for houses in maiden castle during the site 's reconstruction in the 5th century & nbsp ; bc ; this is probably because the site has not been fully excavated and a quarry used to provide material for the rampart may have obliterated the evidence on the south of the fort , four ramparts and three ditches were added , but because of the steepness of the northern slope of the hill , the fourth rampart did not extend all the way round , and only three ramparts were built on the northern side good quality iron ore could be found in the surrounding area , but the hill fort does not appear to have been a centre for iron production in this period ; this is not unusual as very few hill forts in berkshire , dorset , hampshire , and wiltshire exhibit traces of iron production such change is not as obvious in dorset as it is in the rest of britain , but there is a trend for abandonment of hill forts in the area and a proliferation of small undefended farmsteads , indicating a migration of the population in addition to the burials , which indicate the site at maiden castle was important for rituals related to death , pottery from the coast and areas to the east and west was found here , indicating that the site was a meeting place that attracted people over long distances around 1,800 & nbsp ; bc , during the early bronze age , the hill was cleared and used to grow crops , but the soil was quickly exhausted and the site abandoned the modern name for the hill fort is first recorded in 1607 as mayden castell ; it is not unique to the site and occurs in several other places in britain and is widely taken to mean a '' fortification that looks impregnable '' or one that has never been taken in battle there are around 31 & nbsp ; hill forts in dorset ; archaeologist sharples , who undertook excavations at maiden castle , proposed that hill forts were used to control agricultural land to support a large community in the middle iron age , maiden castle was expanded and in the process it became the largest hill fort in britain sharples ( 1991a ) , pp as some hill forts were expanded , many of the smaller hill forts that had proliferated in the early iron age fell out of use , as was the case in dorset the only other significant activity on the hill top after the romans was a short period of cultivation in the 17th century , as demonstrated by traces of ridge and furrow caused by ploughing wheeler 's excavations on the cemetery in the eastern gateway revealed 52 & nbsp ; burials , but only part of the cemetery was investigated , so the total number of burials is likely to be at least double this figure it has been suggested that this , and the contemporary change in material culture of the britons ( such as the introduction of coinage and cemeteries and an increase in craft industries ) , was caused by increased interaction with the roman empire it was one of about 80 & nbsp ; hill forts to have been excavated by 1940 , in a period known as '' hill fort mania '' during the 1920s and 1930s not much is known about the material culture and economy of the early iron age , and the paucity of finds from this period at maiden castle makes it difficult to draw conclusions about activity on the site based on the discovery of a group of bodies in the late iron age formal cemetery that had met a violent death , archaeologist mortimer wheeler created a vivid story of the fall of maiden castle to roman forces constructed on a territorial boundary in about 600 & nbsp ; bc , the first hill fort at maiden castle was a area surrounded by a single ditch between 1985 and 1986 further excavations under niall sharples were prompted by the hill fort 's deteriorating condition , partly caused by the large number of visitors to the site the eastern part of the hill fort remained in use for at least the first few decades of the roman occupation , although the duration and nature of habitation is uncertain image : roman temple , maiden castle.jpg thumb left 300px site of the roman temple at maiden castle in ad & nbsp ; 43 , the roman conquest of britain began there is little evidence for burial in the iron age until late on in the period , and it is believed that the prevalent method of disposing of a body was by excarnation although there is a layer of charcoal , it is associated with the iron works , and the main evidence for slighting of defences comes from the collapse of an entranceway to the fort the first widespread investigation of hill forts was carried out in the second half of the 19th century under the direction of augustus pitt-rivers , cunliffe ( 1983 ) , pp also during the late iron age , some of the earthworks around the eastern gateway were filled in and settlement expanded beyond the entrance , and into the areas between the banks archaeologist niall sharples , who was involved in excavating the hill fort in the 1980s , has identified the hilltop views of the surrounding landscape as a likely factor for the enclosure 's position on the industrial site , more than of iron slag was discovered in an area of , and it is believed the site produced around of iron it has been argued that they could have been defensive sites constructed in response to invasion from continental europe , built by invaders , or a military reaction to social tensions caused by an increasing population and resulting pressure on agriculture dating from around 4000 & nbsp ; bc , it was an oval area enclosed by two ditches , sharples ( 1991a ) , p at the same time , the eastern entrance was again made more complex through the addition of further earthworks , lengthening the approach to the site this is supported by cunliffe , who argues that the elaborate earthworks such as those around the entrances to maiden castle and danebury were used to defend the weakest part of the hill fort there is evidence for activity on the site in the form of a few post-roman or anglo saxon burials , some possibly christian , but the hill fort was not reused as a settlement at the same time , the western half of the site was abandoned and occupation was concentrated in the east of the fort this , and the abandonment of the smaller hill forts in the area when the developed hill forts were built , indicates that these developed hill forts were important in 1921 , the english composer john ireland ( 18791962 ) wrote the tone poem mai-dun , a symphonic rhapsody about the place , adopting hardy 's name for it this was a characteristic of vespasian 's campaign in the region ; there was military occupation at cadbury castle in somerset , hembury in devon , and hodd hill in dorset a more recent explanation has been advanced by richard coates suggesting that the name is only of medieval origin , and was applied simultaneously to the considerable number of identically named locations around the country situated on the side of the hill , it would have been visible from several miles away , and when first cut the ditches would have exposed the underlying white chalk and stood out against the green hillside at the same time as the temple was built , the fort 's eastern gateway was refurbished ; there was possibly another shrine inside the gateway the structure was made a scheduled ancient monument in 1981 , giving maiden castle protection against unauthorised change ; it is now maintained by english heritage at the eastern end of the ridge and rising above sea level , the site of the first hill fort was not the highest point along the ridge however , nearby poundbury and chalbury date to the same period , so through comparison it is possible to infer the early iron age activity at maiden castle vespasian 's subsequent campaign to conquer the tribes of the atrebates , dumnonii , and durotriges in the southwest of britain took place in ad & nbsp ; 43–47 although sharples states that developed hill forts such as maiden castle are not towns and can not be considered truly urban because they are so closely related to agriculture and storage , sharples ( 1991a ) , p hill forts developed in the late bronze age and early iron age , roughly the start of the 1st millennium bc across britain , many hill forts fell out of use in the 100 & nbsp ; years around the turn of the millennium according to the ancient geographer ptolemy , writing in the 2nd century & nbsp ; ad , dunium was the main settlement of the durotriges but it was not until the 1930s that maiden castle was methodically investigated , the first large-scale excavation of the interior of a hill fort between 1934 and 1937 , mortimer wheeler and tessa wheeler excavated both the interior and the defences , work that was funded almost entirely by donations from the public
