in summary , the two-source hypothesis proposes that matthew and luke used mark for its narrative material as well as for the basic structural outline of chronology of jesus ' life ; and that matthew and luke use a second source , q ( from german quelle , '' source '' ) , not extant , for the sayings ( logia ) found in both of them but not in mark the minor agreements are also , according to the critics , evidence of the non-existence of , or rather the non-necessity for , q : if matthew and luke have passages which are missing in mark ( the '' who is it that struck you ? '' sentence quoted above is a famous example ) , this demonstrates only that matthew is quoting luke or vice versa the hypothesis is a solution to what is known as the synoptic problem : the question of how best to account for the differences and similarities between the three synoptic gospels , matthew , mark and luke while the 2sh remains the most popular explanation for the origins of the synoptic gospels , two questions - the existence of the so-called '' minor agreements , '' and problems with the hypothesis of q - continue at the centre of discussion over its explanatory power a variant of the augustinian hypothesis , attempting to synchronise matthew and mark on the basis of the mosaic '' two witnesses '' requirement of deuteronomy 19:15 ( matthew + mark → luke ) , was proposed by eta linnemann , following rejection of the view of her teacher rudolf bultmann the '' minor agreements '' —the word '' minor '' here is not intended to be belittling—are those points where matthew and luke agree against mark ( for example , the mocking question at the beating of jesus , '' who is it that struck you ? '' , found in both matthew and luke but not in mark ) in britain , the most influential modern opponents of the 2sh favor the farrer hypothesis , while farmer 's revised griesbach hypothesis , also known as the two gospel hypothesis , is probably the chief rival to the two source hypothesis in america the more sophisticated versions of mark 's pericopes in matthew and luke must be either the result of those two '' cleaning up '' mark , if his is the first gospel , or of mark '' dumbing down '' matthew and/or luke , if he was later by the 18th century the problems with augustine 's idea led johann jakob griesbach to put forward the griesbach hypothesis , which was that luke had revised matthew and that mark had then written a shorter gospel using material on which both matthew and luke agreed ( matthew → luke → mark ) the traditional view is represented by the augustinian hypothesis , which is that the four gospels were written in the order in which they appear in the bible ( matthew → mark → luke ) , with mark a condensed edition of matthew any solution to the synoptic problem needs to account for two features : the '' triple tradition '' : the three gospels frequently share both wording and arrangement of '' pericopes '' ( incidents , stories - this substantial sharing is what led to them being called '' synoptic '' , or seeing-together ) the two-document hypothesis emerged in the 19th century : mark as the earliest gospel , matthew and luke written independently and reliant on both mark and the hypothetical q on a more specific level , marcan priority seems to be indicated due to instances where matthew and luke apparently omit explanatory material from mark , where matthew adds his own theological emphases to mark 's stories , and in the uneven distribution of mark 's stylistic features in matthew accordingly , some scholars ( like helmut koester ) who wish to keep q while acknowledging the force of the minor agreements attribute them to a proto-mark , such as the ur-markus in the markan hypothesis ( mkh ) , adapted by mark independently from its use by matthew and luke the existence of q follows from the conclusion that , as luke and matthew are independent of mark in the double tradition , the connection between them must be explained by their joint but independent use of a missing source or sources streeter further argued that additional sources , referred to as m and l , lie behind the material in matthew and luke respectively
