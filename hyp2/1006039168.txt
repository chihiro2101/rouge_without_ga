this period contains technetium , one of the two elements until lead that has no stable isotopes ( along with promethium ) , as well as molybdenum and iodine , two of the heaviest elements with a known biological role , and niobium has the largest magnetic known penetration depth of all the elements many later transition metals , such as rhodium , are very commonly used in jewelry due to the fact that they are incredibly shiny this period is known to have a large number of exceptions to the madelung rule it is an alkali metal , the most reactive group in the periodic table , having properties and similarities with both other alkali metals and other period 5 elements for example , rubidium has 5 electron shells , a property found in all other period 5 elements , whereas its electron configuration 's ending is similar to all other alkali metals : s 1 rubidium also follows the trend of increasing reactivity as the atomic number increases in the alkali metals , for it is more reactive than potassium , but less so than caesium rubidium is very susceptible to redox in air , similar to most of the other alkali metals , so it readily transforms into rubidium oxide , a yellow solid with the chemical formula rb 2 o like rubidium , it has 5 electron shells or energy levels , and in accordance with the madelung rule it has two electrons in its 5s subshell if it does come in contact with water , though , it will combine with the atoms of both oxygen and hydrogen to form strontium hydroxide and pure hydrogen gas which quickly diffuses in the air the most important use of yttrium is in making phosphors , such as the red ones used in television set cathode ray tube ( crt ) displays and in leds other uses include the production of electrodes , electrolytes , electronic filters , lasers and superconductors ; various medical applications ; and as traces in various materials to enhance their properties niobium , or columbium , is a chemical element with the symbol nb and atomic number 41 it is a soft , grey , ductile transition metal , which is often found in the pyrochlore mineral , the main commercial source for niobium , and columbite niobium has physical and chemical properties similar to those of the element tantalum , and the two are therefore difficult to distinguish in 1864 and 1865 , a series of scientific findings clarified that niobium and columbium were the same element ( as distinguished from tantalum ) , and for a century both names were used interchangeably the name is from neo-latin molybdaenum , from ancient greek , meaning lead , itself proposed as a loanword from anatolian luvian and lydian languages , since its ores were confused with lead ores molybdenum minerals have long been known , but the element was '' discovered '' ( in the sense of differentiating it as a new entity from the mineral salts of other metals ) in 1778 by carl wilhelm scheele in 1937 technetium ( specifically the technetium-97 isotope ) became the first predominantly artificial element to be produced , hence its name ( from the greek , meaning '' artificial '' ) because no isotope of technetium has a half-life longer than 4.2 & nbsp ; million years ( technetium-98 ) , its detection in red giants in 1952 , which are billions of years old , helped bolster the theory that stars can produce heavier elements rhodium is a chemical element that is a rare , silvery-white , hard , and chemically inert transition metal and a member of the platinum group naturally occurring rhodium is found as the free metal , alloyed with similar metals , and never as a chemical compound rhodium is a so-called noble metal , resistant to corrosion , found in platinum- or nickel ores together with the other members of the platinum group metals palladium is a chemical element with the chemical symbol pd and an atomic number of 46 palladium , platinum , rhodium , ruthenium , iridium and osmium form a group of elements referred to as the platinum group metals ( pgms ) ore deposits of palladium and other pgms are rare , and the most extensive deposits have been found in the norite belt of the bushveld igneous complex covering the transvaal basin in south africa , the stillwater complex in montana , united states , the thunder bay district of ontario , canada , and the norilsk in russia silver is a metallic chemical element with the chemical symbol ag , from the indo-european root arg- for '' grey '' or '' shining '' ) and atomic number 47 the metal occurs naturally in its pure , free form ( native silver ) , as an alloy with gold and other metals , and in minerals such as argentite and chlorargyrite silver has long been valued as a precious metal , and it is used to make ornaments , jewelry , high-value tableware , utensils ( hence the term silverware ) , and currency coins today , silver metal is also used in electrical contacts and conductors , in mirrors and in catalysis of chemical reactions indium was discovered in 1863 and named for the indigo blue line in its spectrum that was the first indication of its existence in zinc ores , as a new and unknown element in a similar way to aluminium salts , indium ( iii ) ions can be toxic to the kidney when given by injection , but oral indium compounds do not have the chronic toxicity of salts of heavy metals , probably due to poor absorption in basic conditions radioactive indium-111 ( in very small amounts on a chemical basis ) is used in nuclear medicine tests , as a radiotracer to follow the movement of labeled proteins and white blood cells in the body tin is the 49th most abundant element and has , with 10 stable isotopes , the largest number of stable isotopes in the periodic table its extreme rarity in the earth 's crust , comparable to that of platinum , is partly due to its high atomic number , but also due to its formation of a volatile hydride which caused the element to be lost to space as a gas during the hot nebular formation of the planet although generally unreactive , xenon can undergo a few chemical reactions such as the formation of xenon hexafluoroplatinate , the first noble gas compound to be synthesized the first excimer laser design used a xenon dimer molecule ( xe 2 ) as its lasing medium , and the earliest laser designs used xenon flash lamps as pumps owing to the diverse functions of the remainder of the enzymes , molybdenum is a required element for life in higher organisms ( eukaryotes ) , though not in all bacteria in humans , tellurium is partly metabolized into dimethyl telluride , ( ch 3 ) 2 te , a gas with a garlic-like odor which is exhaled in the breath of victims of tellurium toxicity or exposure iodine is the heaviest essential element utilized widely by life in biological functions ( only tungsten , employed in enzymes by a few species of bacteria , is heavier ) iodine 's rarity in many soils , due to initial low abundance as a crust-element , and also leaching of soluble iodide by rainwater , has led to many deficiency problems in land animals and inland human populations the radioisotope iodine-131 , which has a high fission product yield , concentrates in the thyroid , and is one of the most carcinogenic of nuclear fission products
