in his introduction to an essay concerning human understanding , locke defines idea as '' that term which , i think , serves best to stand for whatsoever is the object of the understanding when a man thinks , i have used it to express whatever is meant by phantasm , notion , species , or whatever it is which the mind can be employed about in thinking ; and i could not avoid frequently using it one view on the nature of ideas is that there exist some ideas ( called innate ideas ) which can be general and abstract that they could not have arisen as a representation of an object of our perception but rather were in some sense always present thus the idea of a centaur is a complex mental picture composed of the ideas of man and horse , that of a mermaid of a woman and a fish that is , as in the example given above of the idea of a chair , a great many objects , differing materially in detail , all call a single idea when a man , for example , has obtained an idea of chairs in general by comparison with which he can say '' this is a chair , that is a stool '' , he has what is known as an '' abstract idea '' distinct from the reproduction in his mind of any particular chair ( see abstraction ) baldwin , in the dictionary of philosophy and psychology , define idea as '' the reproduction with a more or less adequate image , of an object not actually present to the senses plato argued in dialogues such as the phaedo , symposium , republic , and timaeus that there is a realm of ideas or forms ( eidei ) , which exist independently of anyone who may have thoughts on these ideas , and it is the ideas which distinguish mere opinion from knowledge , for unlike material things which are transient and liable to contrary properties , ideas are unchanging and nothing but just what they are protecting ideas : can ideas be protected or patented ?
