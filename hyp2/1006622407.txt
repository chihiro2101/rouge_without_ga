a tunnel is relatively long and narrow ; the length is often much greater than twice the diameter , although similar shorter excavations can be constructed , such as cross passages between tunnels for example , the definition of a road tunnel in the united kingdom is defined as '' a subsurface highway structure enclosed for a length of or more '' in the united states , the nfpa definition of a tunnel is '' an underground structure with a design length greater than and a diameter greater than '' in the uk , a pedestrian , cycle or animal tunnel beneath a road or railway is called a subway , while an underground railway system is differently named in different cities , the '' underground '' or the '' tube '' in london , the '' subway '' in glasgow , and the '' metro '' in newcastle the place where a road , railway , canal or watercourse passes under a footpath , cycleway , or another road or railway is most commonly called a bridge or , if passing under a canal , an aqueduct a longer underpass containing a road , canal or railway is normally called a '' tunnel '' , whether or not it passes under another item of infrastructure in the us , the term '' subway '' means an underground rapid transit system , and the term pedestrian underpass is used for a passage beneath a barrier the tunnel of eupalinos is a tunnel aqueduct long running through mount kastro in samos , greece , built in the 6th century bc to serve as an aqueduct it is common practice to locate a tunnel deeper than otherwise would be required , in order to excavate through solid rock or other material that is easier to support during construction conventional desk and preliminary site studies may yield insufficient information to assess such factors as the blocky nature of rocks , the exact location of fault zones , or the stand-up times of softer ground this smaller tunnel is less likely to collapse catastrophically should unexpected conditions be met , and it can be incorporated into the final tunnel or used as a backup or emergency escape passage knowing this parameter allows the engineers to determine how far an excavation can proceed before support is needed , which in turn affects the speed , efficiency , and cost of construction water-crossing tunnels built instead of bridges include the holland tunnel and lincoln tunnel between new jersey and manhattan in new york city ; the queens-midtown tunnel between manhattan and the borough of queens on long island ; the detroit-windsor tunnel between michigan and ontario ; and the elizabeth river tunnels between norfolk and portsmouth , virginia ; the 1934 river mersey road queensway tunnel ; the western scheldt tunnel , zeeland , netherlands ; and the north shore connector tunnel in pittsburgh , pennsylvania other reasons for choosing a tunnel instead of a bridge include avoiding difficulties with tides , weather , and shipping during construction ( as in the channel tunnel ) , aesthetic reasons ( preserving the above-ground view , landscape , and scenery ) , and also for weight capacity reasons ( it may be more feasible to build a tunnel than a sufficiently strong bridge ) some water crossings are a mixture of bridges and tunnels , such as the oresund bridge and the chesapeake bay bridge-tunnel in virginia the method of tunnel construction depends on such factors as the ground conditions , the groundwater conditions , the length and diameter of the tunnel drive , the depth of the tunnel , the logistics of supporting the tunnel excavation , the final use and the shape of the tunnel and appropriate risk management finally , a tube can be sunk into a body of water , which is called an immersed tunnel cut-and-cover is a simple method of construction for shallow tunnels where a trench is excavated and roofed over with an overhead support system strong enough to carry the load of what is to be built above the tunnel shallow tunnels are often of the cut-and-cover type ( if under water , of the immersed-tube type ) , while deep tunnels are excavated , often using a tunnelling shield this , and the availability of electric traction , brought about london underground 's switch to bored tunnels at a deeper level towards the end of the 19th century disadvantages of tbms arise from their usually large size – the difficulty of transporting the large tbm to the site of tunnel construction , or ( alternatively ) the high cost of assembling the tbm on-site , often within the confines of the tunnel being constructed some types of tbms , the bentonite slurry , and earth-pressure balance machines have pressurized compartments at the front end , allowing them to be used in difficult conditions below the water table despite these difficulties , tbms are now preferred over the older method of tunnelling in compressed air , with an airlock/decompression chamber some way back from the tbm , which required operators to work in high pressure and go through decompression procedures at the end of their shifts , much like deep-sea divers in february 2010 , aker wirth delivered a tbm to switzerland , for the expansion of the linth–limmern power stations located south of linthal in the canton of glarus a larger tbm was built to bore the green heart tunnel ( dutch : tunnel groene hart ) as part of the hsl-zuid in the netherlands , with a diameter of used in victorian civil engineering , the method found favor in the renewal of britain 's ancient sewerage systems , by not having to remove all property or infrastructure to create a small tunnel system if a tunnel is going to be long , multiple shafts at various locations may be bored so that entrance to the tunnel is closer to the unexcavated area the main idea of this method is to use the geological stress of the surrounding rock mass to stabilize the tunnel , by allowing a measured relaxation and stress reassignment into the surrounding rock to prevent full loads becoming imposed on the supports during construction of a tunnel it is often convenient to install a temporary railway , particularly to remove spoil tip , often narrow gauge so that it can be double track to allow the operation of empty and loaded trains at the same time the vehicles or traffic using a tunnel can outgrow it , requiring replacement or enlargement : the original single line gib tunnel near mittagong was replaced with a double-track tunnel , with the original tunnel used for growing mushrooms the thirlmere aqueduct in north west england , united kingdom is sometimes considered the longest tunnel , of any type , in the world at , though the aqueduct 's tunnel section is not continuous the dahuofang water tunnel in china , opened in 2009 , is the third longest water tunnel in the world at length the gotthard base tunnel in switzerland , opened in 2016 , is the longest and deepest railway tunnel in the world at length and maximum depth below the gotthard massif the lötschberg base tunnel in switzerland was the longest land rail tunnel , with a length of , from its inauguration in 2007 until the completion of the gotthard base tunnel in 2016 the lærdal tunnel in norway from lærdal to aurland is the world 's longest road tunnel , intended for cars and similar vehicles , at the zhongnanshan tunnel in people 's republic of china opened in january 2007 is the world 's second longest highway tunnel and the longest mountain road tunnel in asia , at the tunnel is long and at above sea level is the highest active railroad tunnel in the us ( the tennessee pass line , currently inactive , and alpine tunnel are higher ) four of the tunnels ( allegheny mountain , tuscarora mountain , kittatinny mountain , and blue mountain ) remain in active use , while the other three ( laurel hill , rays hill , and sideling hill ) were bypassed in the 1960s ; the latter two tunnels are on a bypassed section of the turnpike now commonly known as the abandoned pennsylvania turnpike the central artery road tunnel in boston , massachusetts , is a part of the larger big dig completed around 2007 , and carries approximately 200,000 vehicles/day under the city along interstate 93 , us route 1 , and massachusetts route 3 , which share a concurrency through the tunnels the stormwater management and road tunnel or smart tunnel , is a combined storm drainage and road structure opened in 2007 in kuala lumpur , malaysia gerrards cross tunnel , in england , opened in 2010 , is notable in that it converted an existing railway cutting into a tunnel to create ground to build a supermarket over the tunnel excavation techniques , as well as the construction of underground bunkers and other habitable areas , are often associated with tunnel warfare , or civilian responses to threat of attack secret passage have given entrance to or escape from an area , such as the cu chi tunnels or the gaza strip smuggling tunnels which connect it to egypt some of these tunnels were equipped with lighting , ventilation , telephones , drainage pumps , hydraulic elevators , and in at least one instance , an electrified rail transport system the long , high , and wide tunnel is said to be the hole made by an arrow of the angry troll hestmannen , the hill being the hat of the troll-king of sømna trying to save the beautiful lekamøya the hobby photograph has waited three years for this rare shot of the sun shining through torghatten mount small '' snow tunnels '' , called burrows , are created by voles , chipmunks and other rodents for protection and access to food sources
