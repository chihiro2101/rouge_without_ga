the elder de gray was instrumental in securing the selection of his nephew as lord chancellor , as he was a surety for walter 's payment of a fine of 5000 & nbsp ; marks to acquire the position 149 shortly after john became king , de gray began travelling between england and the continent on royal business , and for the first two years of john 's reign was active in the royal chancery , sealing royal charters de gray was elected bishop of norwich on about 7 september 1200 , although the election was purely pro forma , as acknowledged by a contemporary writer roger of howden , who stated that the new bishop '' succeeded to the bishopric of norwich by the gift of king john '' 261 his consecration took place together with that of the new bishop of hereford giles de braose at westminster , at the conclusion of a provincial church council held by archbishop walter , which de gray had been attending while bishop , de gray often lent the king money , and on one occasion held the regalia as security for the repayment of a loan ; he also served as a royal justice philip had demanded that john 's niece eleanor of brittany or his nephew arthur of brittany be surrendered to him together with all of john 's lands on the continent , none of which john was prepared to concede 162 when john abandoned normandy in late 1203 , effectively relinquishing control of the duchy to philip , de gray was one of his companions on the journey to the port of barfleur , and went on to england with the king john 's attempt to impose de gray 's election as archbishop of canterbury in 1205 was the beginning of the king 's long quarrel with pope innocent & nbsp ; iii the bishops of the province of canterbury claimed the right to a say in who was elected , as whoever was chosen would be their superior , harding england in the thirteenth century p 195–196 while the delegations from the various parties were in rome , the monks of canterbury secretly elected one of their own , reginald , as archbishop , and subsequently sent him to rome to join the delegation 35–37 a further story , from roger of wendover , states that the monks elected reginald before walter was even buried , and that only a few members of the cathedral chapter & nbsp ; – the younger ones & nbsp ; – participated in the election john did not accept langton 's candidacy however , and innocent 's consecration of langton in 1207 led to an eight-year struggle between john and the pope over the rights of the king to secure the election of his choice as archbishop innocent went on to excommunicate john in 1209 , in a dispute that led to the exile of many of the english clergy and john 's imposition of heavy financial demands on the church in england ; by 1209 de gray and peter des roches , the bishop of winchester , were the only living english bishops not in exile but it was not until 1213 , when innocent began to support john 's deposition , that the king became concerned and reached a settlement with the papacy as a bishop , it was de gray 's ecclesiastical duty to enforce the interdict , but by going to ireland , which was not under interdict , he could continue to serve the king without provoking the papacy de gray demanded that marshal surrender de braose to him as a traitor , but marshal refused , claiming that since he held some lands from de braose , it would be an act of treason to surrender his lord to an outside authority in 1212 he led a campaign against áed méith , in the promotion of which he constructed castles at cáel uisce , belleek , and clones , bases for raids against the ua néill territory in the north 108 he continued to hold the office of governor for a time , but by july 1213 he had been replaced by henry de loundres , the archbishop of dublin one of de gray 's final acts as justiciar was to take a force of irish knights to england to help repel a threatened invasion by the french king philip ii 204 in may 1213 , john and innocent finally resolved the dispute over langton 's election to canterbury , and part of the settlement was that john gave ireland and england to innocent and received them back from the pope , making john a papal vassal while in that city the bishop was named as one of the guarantors of a new financial arrangement between the king and the pope dealing with feudal payments from england , which lowered the lump sum that had to be paid before innocent would lift the interdict 58 another clerk employed by de gray , robert de bingham , was in the bishop 's household during the papal interdict on england ; he went on to become a tutor in theology at oxford , and bishop of salisbury in 1228 sidney painter , a historian and biographer of john , said of de gray that he was '' probably the only man whom john trusted absolutely and without reservation for the whole period of their association '' matthew paris , a medieval writer , called him an '' evil counsellor '' , quoted in haines '' gray , john de '' oxford dictionary of national biography and blamed many of the difficulties of john 's later reign on de gray 's failed election to canterbury
