however , these non-regimental units tend to be short-lived ; and regiments have tended to retain their traditional responsibilities for ceremonial duties , the recruitment of volunteers , induction of new recruits , individual morale and esprit de corps , and administrative roles ( such as pay ) the royal australian regiment includes all of the australian army 's regular infantry ( other than reserve and special forces units ) , and the artillery units of the british army are known collectively as the royal regiment of artillery , which is sub-divided for operation purposes into field regiments the french term régiment is considered to have entered military usage in europe at the end of the 16th century , when armies evolved from collections of retinues who followed knights , to formally organised , permanent military forces at that time , regiments were usually named after their commanding colonels , and disbanded at the end of the campaign or war ; the colonel and his regiment might recruit from and serve several monarchs or countries later , it was customary to name the regiment by its precedence in the line of battle , and to recruit from specific places , called cantons the oldest regiments which still exist , and their dates of establishment , include the spain 9th infantry regiment '' soria '' ( originally the tercio de nápoles ) ( 1505 ) , sweden life guards ( 1521 ) , the british honourable artillery company ( 1537 ) and the king 's own immemorial regiment of spain , first established in 1248 during the conquest of seville by king ferdinand the saint 23 by the beginning of the 18th century , regiments in most european continental armies had evolved into permanent units with distinctive titles and uniforms , each under the command of a colonel christopher duffy , pages 110 & 121 the military experience in the age of reason , on campaign , these numbers were soon reduced by casualties and detachments and it was sometimes necessary to amalgamate regiments or to withdraw them to a depot while recruits were obtained and trained prior to world war i , an infantry regiment in the french , german , russian , and other smaller armies would comprise four battalions , each with a full strength on mobilization of about 1,000 men a notable exception to this practice was the british line infantry system where the two regular battalions constituting a regiment alternated between '' home '' and '' foreign '' service and seldom came together as a single unit in the regimental system , each regiment is responsible for recruiting , training , and administration ; each regiment is permanently maintained and therefore the regiment will develop its unique esprit de corps because of its unitary history , traditions , recruitment , and function in the continental system , the division is the functional army unit , and its commander is the administrator of every aspect of the formation : his staff train and administer the soldiers , officers , and commanders of the division 's subordinate units disadvantages of the regimental system are hazardous regimental competition , a lack of interchangeability between units of different regiments , and more pronounced '' old boy networks '' within the military that may hamper efficiency and fairness the aspects that an administrative regiment might have in common include a symbolic colonel-in-chief ( often a member of the royal family ) , a colonel ( united kingdom ) ceremonial usage who protects the traditions and interests of the regimental family and insists on the maintenance of high standards , battle honours ( honours earned by one unit of an administrative regiment are credited to the regiment ) , ceremonial uniforms , cap badges , peculiarities of insignia , stable belts , and regimental marches and songs the system presents difficulties for military planners , who must deal with the problems of trying to keep soldiers of a regiment together throughout their careers and of administering separate garrisons , training and mess facilities this is particularly relevant to british experience during the days of the empire , where the army was virtually continuously engaged in low-intensity conflict with insurgents , and full-scale warfare was the exception rather than the rule further , the regimental system offers the advantage of grouping like units together for centralized administrative , training , and logistical purposes , thereby creating an '' economies of scale '' effect and its ensuing increased efficiency in the british army and armies modeled on it ( such as the australian , the new zealand , the canadian , the pakistani and the indian ) , the term regiment is used confusingly in two different ways : it can mean an administrative identity and grouping , or a tactical unit in the former dominion of newfoundland , '' regiment '' was used to describe the entirety of the fighting armed forces , the royal newfoundland regiment in the case of india , '' large regiments '' of four to five battalions date from 1923 and , since the 1950s , many of these have expanded even further as an example , the punjab regiment of the indian army has expanded from four battalions in 1956 to its present strength of 20 , while , in pakistan , several regiments have over 50 battalions in canada , the regiment is a formation of one or more units ; existing almost exclusively for reasons of heritage , the continuance of battle honors and esprit de corps in australia , there is but one administrative infantry regiment in the regular army : the royal australian regiment , consisting of all seven regular infantry battalions in the army in the british army , for most purposes , the regiment is the largest '' permanent '' organisational unit because of their permanent nature , many regiments have long histories , often going back for centuries : the oldest british regiment still in existence is the royal jersey militia , established in 1337 although historically the jersey militia are referred to as a regiment it is disputed that they are in fact a corps these claims are contested on various points of precedence ; see faq : regiments , in general and especially : faq : oldest regiment in the british army in the united kingdom , there existed until recently a number of administrative '' divisions '' in the infantry that encompassed several regiments , such as the guards division , the former scottish division ( now a single regiment ) , or the light division ( now also compressed into a multi-battalion single regiment ) the reduction and consolidation of british infantry regiments that began in the late 1950s and concluded in 2006 has resulted in a system of administrative regiments each with several battalions , a band , a common badge and uniform etc it should , however , be noted that amalgamations beginning in the late 1950s and ending in 2006 have diluted the british regimental system through the now almost universal adoption of '' large regiments '' for the infantry of the army in britain , every infantry battalion bears a number , even if it is the only remaining battalion in the regiment ( in that case it is the 1st battalion , with the exception of the irish regiment of canada , which has a 2nd battalion only ) traditionally , the regular battalions were the 1st and 2nd battalions , the militia ( later special reserve ) battalion was the 3rd battalion , and the army reserve battalions were the 4th battalion , the 5th battalion and up in practice , it is impossible to exercise all the administrative functions of a true regiment when the regiment consists of a single unit thus in the armoured corps , the traditional administrative '' regiment '' tends to play more of a ceremonial role , while in practice , its members are administered by their corps or '' branch '' as in the artillery during this period the army , or '' legion '' , was organized into four '' sub-legions '' , 18th century forerunners of the modern brigade combat team that combined infantry , rifleman , artillery , and cavalry from colonial times , the regiment consisted of a small regimental headquarters ( regimental headquarters company not existing before 1915 ) and in 1775 ten '' line '' companies , based on the british army model , without any permanent intermediate level of organization , viz ) traditionally , the regiment and battalion were one and the same , with the '' battalion '' simply being the regiment organized for battle regiments were usually commanded by a colonel , assisted by a lieutenant colonel and a major , as well as additional staff officers and enlisted men in the regimental headquarters occasionally , a regimental commander would organize several companies into one , or rarely two , temporary organizations , called battalions , under command of the regiment 's lieutenant colonel , major , or a senior captain , war department , adjutant general 's office , washington , may 4 , 1861 : in 1890 , the number of companies in a regiment was reduced from the traditional ten to only eight , as the end of the indian wars became evident and troop reductions became in order until 1917 , under its traditional triangular organizational plan , infantry regiments were organized into brigades of three regiments , with three infantry brigades ( for a total of nine infantry regiments ) , along with one brigade each of cavalry and field artillery constituting a division in 1917 the army adopted the square division organizational plan , which massively increased the size of units from the company through corps , more than tripling , or nearly quadrupling , the number of troops per unit ) the '' square division '' consisted of two infantry brigades of two infantry regiments each , with each regiment containing a regimental headquarters company , a machinegun company , a supply company , and 12 rifle companies organized into three battalions of four rifle companies each under this plan , divisional brigades were eliminated and the division consisted of three infantry regiments and one artillery regiment , styled as '' division artillery '' ( divarty ) , but usually consisting of battalions with the same regimental affiliation the regiment 's machine gun company was now an anti-tank company , the supply company became the service company , and a cannon company and a medical detachment were added to the regiment army , confirming its elimination as a level of command that had begun in 1942 with the '' combat command '' organization of the armored divisions and furthered by the pentomic experiment in the 1950s in the 20th century , by using modern industrial management techniques , the army was able to draft , assemble , equip , train and then employ huge masses of conscripted civilians in very short order , starting with minimal resources beginning with the first world war , as units became increasingly larger , and weapon systems and equipment became more complex , the regiment , while still filling a role as the immediate headquarters for its organic battalions , began to be replaced by the brigade as the intermediate tactical and operational headquarters for battalions , with the division becoming the senior administrative and logistical headquarters for the battalions , regiments , and brigades under its command the united states army regimental system ( usars ) was established in 1981 to replace the combat arms regimental system , to provide each soldier with continuous identification with a single regiment , and to support that concept with a personnel system that would increase a soldier 's probability of serving recurring assignments with his or her regiment on 1 october 2005 , the word '' regiment '' was formally appended to the name of all active and inactive cars and usars regiments these two regiments , ( currently the 2nd and 1st marines , respectively ) , along with the numerical forbearers of the 3rd and 4th marines , ( formed in 1914 for the short-lived tampico affair with mexico , involving the occupation of veracruz , mexico ) , are the pre-world war i antecedents to the several regiments of the modern u.s each of these two types of regiments contain a headquarters company and varying numbers and types of logistics battalions and separate logistics companies , depending upon whether the regiment 's primary mission is to provide direct support to ( 1 ) a regimental combat team ( rct ) or a marine amphibious unit ( meu ) , or ( 2 ) provide general support across the marine expeditionary force ( mef ) , including intermediate ground logistics support to marine aviation units the regiments the word had common etymology with the scandinavian fólk that in the ancient times meant something akin to a gathering of armed people of the russian army , and armed forces influenced by russia consist of battalions , in the infantry or tank troops , divisions in the artillery troops , and squadrons in aviation troops by the late 1980s , it consisted of a regimental headquarters in command of three motorised rifle battalions , each numbering around five hundred personnel and equipped with either bmp infantry fighting vehicles or btr armoured personnel carriers , and one tank battalion , typically consisting of thirty-one t-64 , t-72 or t-80 tanks , although older models were present in units outside the european theater ( warfare ) these were supported by a battalion of eighteen 122mm artillery pieces , either the self-propelled 2s1 gvozdika in bmp regiments or towed d-30 howitzers in btr regiments , though some btr regiments also used the 2s1 , with additional fire support from the organic mortar battery in each infantry battalion a regimental headquarters oversaw command of three tank battalions of thirty-one tanks each , typically t-64 , t-72 , or t-80 tanks although some units used older models , and an artillery battalion of eighteen 2s1 gvozdika self-propelled howitzers , with some using the older towed d-30 howitzer the artillery regiment of an mrd consisted of three battalions of eighteen 2s3 akatsiyas each and a battalion of eighteen bm-21 grads , numbering just under 1,300 personnel total , while a td artillery regiment had one less battalion of 2s3s and a little over one thousand personnel total numbering a little over five hundred personnel total , the sam regiment consisted of a regimental headquarters in charge of twenty sa-6 gainfuls organised into five missile firing batteries ; most were sa-6a platforms although since 1979 a limited number of sa-6bs were also deployed and some regiments used the sa-8 gecko as an alternative
