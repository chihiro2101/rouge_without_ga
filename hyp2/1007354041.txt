this is in stark contrast to true roan horses and roan cattle , which are roan only in pigmented regions of their coat and may have white markings about 25 % of guinea pigs born to two roans are completely white , having two copies of the '' roan '' allele , and may have a constellation of deformities associated with '' lethal white syndrome '' , although this condition has no relation to overo lethal white syndrome in horses or double merle syndrome in dogs lethal white syndrome symptoms include : partial or complete blindness partial or complete deafness microphthalmia or anophthalmia unpigmented eyes missing or deformed incisors deformed molars elongated tooth roots malabsorption in the small intestine , due in some cases to lack of intestinal villi increased susceptibility to illness roan coloration is not to be confused with the '' magpie '' coloration of guinea pigs , which is a brindle color lacking red pigment due to the '' chinchilla '' allele , an allele also responsible for self white and silver agouti coloration some forms of sabino , which is a pinto pattern , have roaning along the edges of other white spots or markings a roan horse may not fit into any of the traditional categories as there is much still to be learned about the genetics of roan the roan or ticked color is described in many breeds of gundogs such as english cocker spaniels , american cocker spaniels , english springer spaniels , field spaniels and brittanys , german longhaired pointers , german shorthaired pointers , bracco italiano , spinone italiano , lagotto romagnolo , english setters , small münsterländer as well as border collies and many other breeds most breed standards use the terms '' ticked '' and '' roan '' interchangeably , with the former referring to clearly defined flecks on a white background and the latter to flecks so closely spaced that the mixture appears even duns , which are solid-colored horses affected by the dun dilution gene on their bodies but with darker points , are also sometimes confused with roans , but they do not have the intermixed white and colored hairs of a roan rabicano is a white pattern that falls into the category of roaning or scattered white hairs , the genetics of which are not yet fully understood a varnish roan is not a true roan ; it is actually one of the leopard complex coat patterns associated with appaloosa , knabstrupper , noriker horse and related breeds there remains a great deal of ambiguity in terminology regarding mottled dogs , which are called roan , ticked , mottled and belton depending on the context sometimes called ticking , rabicano is common even in breeds that do not have true or classic roan , including arabians and thoroughbreds '' in 2007 , the gene responsible for roan cattle ( kitlg ) was refuted as a possible cause of roan in dogs in 1957 , little suggested that roan and ticking were controlled separately , and postulated that roan may have been homologous to '' silvered '' coat in mice the allele that controls roaning in guinea pigs is incompletely dominant : an animal with one copy of the allele will have varying amounts of white hair scattered through its coat , particularly on the back and sides
