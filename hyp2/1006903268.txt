the idea of an east-to-west waterway link across southern england was first mentioned in elizabethan times , between 1558 and 1603 , to take advantage of the proximity of tributaries of the rivers avon and thames , only apart at their closest the river avon had historically been navigable from bristol to bath , but construction of watermills on the river in the early years of the 13th century had forced its closure the name was changed from western canal to kennet and avon canal to avoid confusion with the grand western canal , which was being proposed at the same time in 1793 a further survey was conducted by john rennie , and the route of the canal was altered to take a more southerly course through great bedwyn , devizes , trowbridge and newbury in 1801 , trade along the canal commenced ; goods initially had to be unloaded at foxhangers at the bottom of what is now caen hill locks , transported up the hill by a wagonway , and reloaded into barges at the top when the flight of locks opened in 1810 , allowing the same vessel to navigate the entire canal , the rate of carriage per ton from london to bath was £2 & nbsp ; 9s & nbsp ; 6d in 1812 , the kennet and avon canal company bought the kennet navigation , which stretched from newbury to the junction with the thames at kennet mouth , near reading at the same time work was undertaken to improve the avon navigation , from bristol to bath , with the kennet and avon canal company purchasing a majority shareholding in the avon navigation in 1816 a link connecting the kennet & avon to the basingstoke canal at its basingstoke terminus was proposed three times between 1793 and 1810 , and a route was even surveyed by john rennie the younger in 1824 , but following opposition from landowners was eventually rejected by parliament in 1824 and 1826 in 1861 a new order prohibited any traffic on the canal at night , and , in 1865 , boats were forced to pass through locks in pairs to reduce water loss in the 1870s water abstraction from the canal near fobney lock followed the regulations introduced in the reading local board waterworks , sewerage , drainage and improvements act of 1870 , and contributed to the silting up of locks and stretches of the canal the somerset coal canal and wilts & berks canal , which each supplied some of the trade from the somerset coalfield to the kennet and avon , closed in 1904 and 1906 respectively in 1926 , following a loss of £18,041 the previous year , the great western railway sought to close the canal by obtaining a ministry of transport order , but the move was resisted and the company charged with improving its maintenance of the canal after the war the transport act of 1947 transferred control of the canal to the british transport commission , but by the 1950s large sections of the canal had been closed because of poor lock maintenance following a breach in the bank west of the avoncliff aqueduct a group supporting the restoration of the canal had been set up in the early 1950s independently of the inland waterways association , with which it was subsequently merged in 1955 john gould , a trader on the eastern section of the waterway , successfully petitioned against the commission 's failure to maintain the waterway and obtained damages for loss of business the committee supported the suspension of the right of navigation , and the bill passed through the house of commons but was amended by the house of lords to include a clause to enforce '' no further deterioration '' the kennet and avon canal trust was formed in 1962 to restore the canal from reading to bristol as a through navigation and as a public amenity in 1963 the newly formed british waterways , which was created by the transport act of the previous year , and replaced the british transport commission as the statutory body for inland waterways , took over the canal and , in partnership with the trust and riparian local authorities , restoration work began the county council in berkshire , supported by local councils , estimated that £1,275,000 was needed for works at the eastern end of the canal and commenced work on replacing some of the bridges in 1983 the manpower services commission , which had a remit to co-ordinate employment and training services in the united kingdom , agreed to employ 50 men on work that included restoration of aldermaston lock , its adjacent wharf , and widmead lock in october 1996 , the kennet & avon canal partnership attracted the largest single national lottery grant awarded by the heritage lottery fund , £25 & nbsp ; million towards a £29 & nbsp ; million project , to complete the restoration and to make it operational , sustainable and accessible for the enjoyment of future generations between 2002 and 2004 the dundas aqueduct , which had been relined with polythene and concrete in 1984 without disturbing a colony of bats living under the aqueduct , was further restored by the replacement of engineering bricks used by the great western railway with bath stone to match the original work the river avon was navigable from bristol to bath during the early years of the 13th century , until the construction of mills on the river forced its closure the modern avon is navigable from its mouth at avonmouth , through the bristol harbour in bristol , as far as pulteney weir in the centre of bath and just beyond the start of the canal beyond pulteney weir the avon is still navigable as far as the weir and site of the old '' flash lock '' at bathampton but the lock at pulteney has been replaced only with a small boat slide for dinghies and canoes the stretch from bristol to bath is made navigable by the use of locks and weirs at hanham , keynsham , swineford , saltford , kelston and weston , which together overcome a rise of within here the a4 crosses close to the newton st loe sssi , which is designated an sssi because it represents the only remaining known exposure of fossiliferous pleistocene gravels containing the remains of mammoths ( mammuthus ) and horses ( equus ) along the river , and has aided the development of a scientific understanding of the history of early glaciation in south west england its construction created an island between the cut and the river weir , which became known as dutch island after the owner of the brass mill established on the riverside in the early 18th century in the avon valley to the east of bath the classic geographical example of a valley with all four forms of ground transport is found : road , rail , river , canal the canal passes the remains of a loading dock , once used for bath stone from the quarries on bathampton down , which was carried down a straight track to the canal over the dry arch rock bridge ( demolished in 1958 to allow double-decker buses to use the a36 ) the canal then crosses over the river and the wessex main line railway at the dundas aqueduct , past conkwell wood , before recrossing the river and railway at the avoncliff aqueduct at the western end of the dundas aqueduct it is joined by the remains of the somerset coal canal , a short stretch of which has been restored to create the brassknocker basin the first sod for the kennet and avon canal was turned in bradford on avon in 1794 , and soon there were wharves above and below bradford lock in the village of semington the wilts & berks canal joined the canal , linking the kennet and avon to the river thames at abingdon in 1977 the wilts & berks canal trust was formed with the aim of fully restoring the canal to re-connect the kennet and avon to the upper reaches of the thames the main flight of 16 locks , which take 5–6 hours & nbsp ; to navigate in a boat , is part of a longer series of 29 locks built in three groups : seven at foxhangers , sixteen at caen hill , and six at the town end of the flight while the locks were under construction in the early 19th century a tramroad provided a link between foxhangers at the bottom of the flight and devizes at the top , the remains of which can be seen in the towpath arches in the road bridges over the canal at the top of the flight is devizes wharf , home to the kennet & avon canal museum , which has a range of exhibits on the conception , design , usage , and eventual commercial decline of the kennet and avon canal , as well as its subsequent restoration at honeystreet is the remains of a wharf that was the home of boat builders robbins , lane and pinnegar , which served as the boat building headquarters of the canal company a number of usable springs were found adjacent to the canal route about east of the summit pound , and about below it , and arrangements were made for them to feed the pound below lock 60 at crofton to the north of the canal are seven separate small areas , four in the kennet valley and three in the river lambourn , which make up the kennet and lambourn floodplain sssi hungerford marsh lock is unique on the kennet and avon canal in that it has a swing bridge directly over the centre of the lock that must be opened before the lock may be used between kintbury lock and newbury , passing to the north of hamstead marshall , the canal is very close to the river kennet , which flows into the canal via several channels a wooden bridge was built over the kennet at newbury in 1726 , replaced in stone between 1769 and 1772 by james clarke , and now known as the town bridge or water bridge the river kennet is navigable from newbury downstream to the confluence with the river thames at kennet mouth , in reading thatcham 's network of gravel pits , reed bed , woodland , hedges and grassland is rich in wildlife and has been made into the nature discovery centre by the royal society for the protection of birds the river kennet itself , from near its sources west of marlborough down to woolhampton , has been designated as a sssi primarily because it has an extensive range of rare plants and animals that are unique to chalk watercourses shortly after passing fobney lock and the associated water treatment works , the kennet flood plain narrows and the river enters a narrow steep-sided gap in the hills forming the southern flank of the thames flood plain originally this short stretch of river , which includes blake 's lock , was under the control of reading abbey , but today it is administered by the environment agency as if it were part of the river thames the annual devizes to westminster international canoe marathon starts from devizes wharf , the site of the kennet & avon canal museum , at first light on good friday each year and the competitors have to negotiate 75 & nbsp ; locks in the route between devizes and the finish at westminster under a partnership arrangement involving british waterways , sustrans , and the riparian local authorities , two main sections of the canal have been improved , and , with a few short diversions , run from reading to marsh benham and from devizes to bath as part of the national cycle network ( ncn ) route 4 fishing for bream , tench , roach , rudd , perch , gudgeon , esox and carp is permitted throughout the year from the towpath of the canal , but almost its whole length is leased to angling associations or fishing clubs
