products not traditionally associated with computer use ( such as tvs or hi-fi equipment ) now provide options to connect to the internet or to a computer using a home network to provide access to digital content the desire for high-definition ( hd ) content has led the industry to develop a number of technologies , such as wirelesshd or itu-t g.hn , which are optimized for distribution of hd content between consumer electronic devices in a home most consumer electronics are built in china , due to maintenance cost , availability of materials , quality , and speed as opposed to other countries such as the united states electronic components are mostly industrial products , available in a singular form and are not to be confused with electrical elements , which are conceptual abstractions representing idealized electronic components some consumer electronics include software that is used on a personal computer in conjunction with electronic devices , such as camcorders and digital cameras , and third-party software for such devices also exists the event , which grew from having 100 exhibitors in its inaugural year to more than 4,500 exhibiting companies in its 2020 edition , features the latest in consumer electronics , speeches by industry experts and innovation awards institute of electrical and electronics engineers ( ieee ) , the world 's largest professional society , has many initiatives to advance the state of the art of consumer electronics in the united states , dedicated consumer electronics stores have mostly given way to big-box retailers such as best buy , the largest consumer electronics retailer in the country , although smaller dedicated stores include apple stores , and specialist stores that serve , for example , audiophiles and exceptions , such as the single-branch b & h photo store in new york city in 2013 , in pittsburgh , pennsylvania , the increased popularity in listening to sound from analog audio devices , such as record players , as opposed to digital sound , has sparked a noticeable increase of business for the electronic repair industry there electronic devices use thousands rare metals and rare-earth element ( 40 on average for a smartphone ) , these material are extracted and refined using water and energy-intensive processes eia.gov the energy consumption of consumer electronics increases – in america and europe – to about 50 % of household consumption , if the term is redefined to include home appliances such as refrigerators , dryers , clothes washers and dishwashers standby power – used by consumer electronics and appliances while they are turned off – accounts for 5–10 % of total household energy consumption , costing 100 annually to the average household in the united states many consumer electronics may contain toxic minerals and elements , and many electronic scrap components , such as crts , may contain contaminants such as lead , cadmium , beryllium , mercury , dioxins , or brominated flame retardants electronic waste recycling may involve significant risk to workers and communities and great care must be taken to avoid unsafe exposure in recycling operations and leaking of materials such as heavy metals from landfills and incinerator ashes however , large amounts of the produced electronic waste from developed countries is exported , and handled by the informal sector in countries like india , despite the fact that exporting electronic waste to them is illegal these include people ’ s mistrust of used equipment in terms of whether it will be functional , safe , and the stigma for some of owning second-hand goods
