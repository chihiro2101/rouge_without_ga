data general developed operating systems for its hardware : dos and rdos for the nova , rdos and aos for the 16-bit eclipse c , m , and s lines , aos/vs and aos/vs ii for the eclipse mv line , and a modified version of unix system v called dg/ux for the eclipse mv and aviion machines most data general software was written specifically for their own terminals ( or the terminal emulation built into the desktop generation dg10 , but the data general one built-in terminal emulator is not often suitable ) , although software using data general business basic could be more flexible in terminal handling , because logging into a business basic system would initiate a process whereby the terminal type would ( usually ) be auto-detected these products also led to the development of a third product , tpms ( transaction processing monitoring system ( announced in 1980 ) ) which could capably run a large number of cobol or pl/i users with a smaller number of processors , a major resource and performance advantage on aos and aos/vs systems other members of the desktop generation range , the dg20 and dg30 , were aimed more at traditional commercial environments , such as multi-user cobol systems , replacing refrigerator-sized minicomputers with toaster-sized modular microcomputers based around the microeclipse cpus and some of the technology developed for the micronova-based '' micro products '' range such as the mp/100 and mp/200 that had struggled to find a market niche although details of the acquisition specified that emc had to take the entire company , and not just the storage line , emc quickly ended all development and production of dg computer hardware and parts , effectively ending data general 's presence in the segment data general also brought out a small-footprint '' desktop generation '' range , starting with the dg10 that included both data general and intel cpus in a patented closely coupled arrangement , able to run ms-dos or cp/m-86 concurrently with dg/rdos , with each benefiting from the hardware acceleration given by other cpu as a co-processor that would handle ( for instance ) screen graphics or disk operations concurrently related system software also in common use at the time included such packages as x.25 , xodiac , and tcp/ip for networking , fortran , cobol , rpg , pl/i , c and data general business basic for programming , infos ii and dg/dbms for databases , and the nascent relational database software dg/sql in 1988 , two company directors put together a report showing that if the company were to continue existing in the future , dg would have to either invest heavily in software to compete with new applications being delivered by ibm and dec on their machines , or alternately exit the proprietary hardware business entirely the eclipse was originally intended to replace the nova outright , evidenced by the fact that the nova 3 series , released at the same time and utilizing virtually the same internal architecture as the eclipse , was phased out the next year data general produced a full range of peripherals , sometimes by rebadging printers for example , but data general 's own series of crt-based and hard-copy terminals were high quality and featured a generous number of function keys , each with the ability to send different codes , with any combination of control and shift keys , which influenced wordperfect design in this market , the question of which machine was the '' best '' changed ; it was no longer the machine with the best price–performance ratio or service contracts , but the one that ran all of the third-party software the customer intended to use at a time when dg invested its last dollar into the dying minicomputer segment , the microcomputer was rapidly making inroads to the lower-end market segment , and the introduction of the first workstations wiped out all 16-bit machines , once dg 's best customer segment clariion was the only product line that saw continued success through the later 1990s after finding a large niche for unix storage systems , and its sales were still strong enough to make dg a takeover target considered genuinely '' portable '' , rather than '' luggable '' , as alternatives often were called , it was a nine-pound battery-powered ms-dos machine equipped with dual 3½-inch diskettes , a 79-key full-stroke keyboard , 128k to 512k of ram , and a monochrome liquid-crystal display ( lcd ) screen capable of either the full-sized standard 80 & times ; 25 characters or full cga graphics ( 640 & times ; 200 ) in the meantime , customers were abandoning data general in droves , driven not only by the delivery problems with the original eclipse , including very serious quality control and customer service problems , but also the power and versatility of digital 's new vax line official website , circa 1996 simulogics ( '' dedicated to preserving the history and legacy of the data general nova , eclipse , mv and compatible computers '' ) carl friend 's computer museum ( has pages for over a dozen dg systems ) data general facebook alumni group designed to be rack-mounted similarly to the later pdp-8 machines , it was packaged on four pcb cards and was thus smaller in height , while also including a number of features that made it run considerably faster data general also targeted the explosion of the internet in the latter 1990s with the formation of the thiin line business unit , led by tom west , which had a focus on creation and sale of so-called '' internet appliances '' data general also offered an office automation suite named ceo ( data general ) ( ceo ) , which included a mail system , a calendar , a folder-based document store , a word processor ( ceowrite ) , a spreadsheet processor , and other assorted tools despite having some good features and having less direct competition from the flood of cheap pc compatibles , the desktop generation range also struggled , partly because they offered an economical way of running what was essentially '' legacy software '' while the future was clearly either slightly cheaper personal computers or slightly more expensive '' super minicomputers '' such as the mv and vax computers the introduction , implementation , and effects of the dg systems in usfs were documented in a series of evaluative reports prepared in the late 1980s by the rand corporation the original nova was soon followed by the faster supernova , which replaced the nova 's 4-bit arithmetic logic unit ( alu ) with a 16-bit version that made the machine roughly four times as fast the model 6053 dasher 2 featured an easily tilted screen , but used many integrated circuits ; the smaller , lighter d100 , d200 and eventually the d210 replaced it as the basic user terminal , while graphics models such as the d460 ( with ansi x3.64 compatibility ) occupied the very high end of the range data general 's introduction of the data general-one ( dg-1 ) in 1984 is one of the few cases of a minicomputer company introducing a truly breakthrough pc product one of data general 's significant customers at this time was the united states forest service , which starting in the mid-1980s used dg systems installed at all levels from headquarters in washington , d.c on the internet , even the old data general domain ( dg.com ) , which contained a few emc webpages that only mentioned the latter company in passing , was sold to the dollar general discount department store chain in october 2009 while dg was still struggling with eclipse , in 1977 , digital announced the vax series , their first 32-bit minicomputer line , described as '' super-minis '' ultimately , fountainhead was cancelled and eagle became the new mv series , with the first model , the data general eclipse mv/8000 , announced in april 1980 the mv series came in various iterations , from the mv/2000 ( later mv/2500 ) , mv/4000 , mv/10000 , mv/15000 , mv/20000 , mv/30000 , mv/40000 and ultimately concluded with the mv/60000ha minicomputer they also outlined a different solution : instead of trying to compete against the much larger ibm and dec , they suggested that since the user no longer cared about the hardware as much as software , dg could deliver the best '' commodity '' machines instead strong demand continued for the nova series , resulting in the nova 4 , perhaps as a result of the continuing problems with the eclipse data general ( dg ) was founded by several engineers from digital equipment corporation who were frustrated with dec 's management and left to form their own company while the mv series did stop the erosion of dg 's customer base , this now smaller base was no longer large enough to allow dg to develop their next generation the eagle project was the subject of tracy kidder 's pulitzer prize-winning book , the soul of a new machine , making the mv line the best-documented computer project in recent history data general would be only one of many new england based computer companies , including the original digital equipment corporation , that collapsed or were sold to larger companies after the 1980s the clariion line was marketed not only to aviion and data general mv series customers , but also to customers running servers from other vendors such as sun microsystems , hewlett packard and silicon graphics the first product was idea ( interactive data entry/access ) , which consisted of a screen design tool ( ifmt ) , tp controller ( imon ) , and a program development language ( ifpl ) the single-processor version of the dg10 , the dg10sp , was the entry-level machine with , like the dg20 and 30 , no ability to run intel software announced as '' the best small computer in the world '' , the nova quickly gained a following , especially in scientific and educational markets , and made the company flush with cash dg did begin a minor shift toward the service industry , training their technicians for the role of implementing a spate of new x86-based servers and the new microsoft windows nt domain-driven , small server world
