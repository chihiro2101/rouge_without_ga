polyphenylene oxide ( ppo ) , which is obtained from the free-radical , step-growth oxidative coupling polymerization of 2,6-xylenol , has many attractive properties such as high heat distortion and impact strength , chemical stability to mineral and organic acids , and low water absorption low-density polyethylene ( ldpe ) is flexible and is used in the manufacture of squeeze bottles , milk jug caps , retail store bags and linear low-density polyethylene ( lldpe ) as stretch wrap in transporting and handling boxes of durable goods , and as the common household food covering polypropylene ( pp ) is useful for such diverse products as reusable plastic food containers , microwave- and dishwasher-safe plastic containers , diaper lining , sanitary pad lining and casing , ropes , carpets , plastic moldings , piping systems , car batteries , insulation for electrical cables and filters for gases and liquids as pvc bends easily and has a tendency to be bent during transit , a method to mitigate this deformation is to heat the plastic until it becomes mobile , then reform the material into the desired shape polylactic acid ( polylactide ) is a compostable thermoplastic aliphatic polyester derived from renewable resources , such as corn starch ( in the united states ) , beet pulp ( in europe ) , tapioca roots , chips or starch ( mostly in asia ) , or sugarcane ppo is difficult to process , and hence the commercial resin ( noryl ) is made by blending ppo with high-impact polystyrene ( hips ) , which serves to reduce the processing temperature the original form is often referred to as unplasticized polyvinyl chloride ( upvc ) , which is the more commonly used type for installations such as water , waste , and sewer conveyance plumbing they are easily worked , molded , and thermoformed for many applications , such as electronic components , construction materials , data storage devices , automotive and aircraft parts , check sockets in prosthetics , and security glazing polyether sulfone ( pes ) or polysulfone is a class of specially engineered thermoplastics with high thermal , oxidative , and hydrolytic stability , and good resistance to aqueous mineral acids , alkalis , salt solutions , oils and greases this increase in elemental chlorine content contributes to cpvc 's increased expression of chlorine-based characteristics , such as chemical durability , resistance to acids , bases , and salts ; susceptibility to ammonia-based compounds , aromatics , esters , ketones ; chemical stability ; heat energy transfer resistance polyoxymethylene ( pom ) , also known as acetal,2 polyacetal and polyformaldehyde , is an engineering thermoplastic used in precision parts requiring high stiffness , low friction , and excellent dimensional stability it is also converted to flexible forms with the addition of plasticizers , thereby making it useful for items such as hoses , tubing , electrical insulation , coats , jackets and upholstery as with many other synthetic polymers , it is produced by different chemical firms with slightly different formulas and sold variously by such names as delrin , celcon , ramtal , duracon , kepital and hostaform polyphenylene sulfide ( pps ) obtained by the condensation polymerization of p-dichlorobenzene and sodium sulfide , has outstanding chemical resistance , good electrical properties , excellent flame retardance , low coefficient of friction and high transparency to microwave radiation today ’ s acrylics industry can be divided into two distinct multibillion-dollar markets : on one hand the polyacrylic acids ( paa ) and its ester derivatives ( pac ) market , on the other hand , the poly ( methyl methacrylate ) ( pmma ) market polyvinyl chloride ( pvc ) is a tough , lightweight material that is durable , fairly rigid and versatile , and is resistant to acids and bases particular grades of pps can be used in injection and compression molding at temperatures ( 300 to 370 & nbsp ; °c ) at which pps particles soften and undergo apparent crosslinking it serves as a sturdy substitute for glass for items such as aquariums , buttons , motorcycle helmet visors , aircraft windows , viewing ports of submersibles , and lenses of exterior lights of automobiles in plasticized polyvinyl chloride ( ppvc ) , plasticizers are added to the raw material before molding to make it more flexible or pliable
