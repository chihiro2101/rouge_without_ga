some common whips such as the bullwhip or stockwhip are able to move faster than sound : the tip of the whip exceeds this speed and causes a sharp crack—literally a sonic boom it is easy to demonstrate that the power needed to improve performance is so great that the weight of the required engine grows faster than the power output of the propeller can compensate this problem was one that led to early research into jet engines , notably by frank whittle in england and hans von ohain in germany , who were led to their research specifically in order to avoid these problems in high-speed flight worse still , a particularly dangerous interaction of the airflow between the wings and tail surfaces of diving lockheed p-38 lightnings made '' pulling out '' of dives difficult ; however , the problem was later solved by the addition of a '' dive flap '' that upset the airflow under these circumstances all of these effects , although unrelated in most ways , led to the concept of a '' barrier '' making it difficult for an aircraft to exceed the speed of sound erroneous news reports caused most people to envision the sound barrier as a physical '' wall '' , which supersonic aircraft needed to '' break '' with a sharp needle nose on the front of the fuselage the typical airspeed indicator ( asi ) uses air pressure differences between two or more points on the aircraft , typically near the nose and at the side of the fuselage , to produce a speed figure at high speed , the various compression effects that lead to the sound barrier also cause the asi to go non-linear and produce inaccurately high or low readings , depending on the specifics of the installation further , a series of tests made by karl doetsch at the behest of willy messerschmitt found that the plane became uncontrollable above mach 0.86 , and at mach 0.9 would nose over into a dive that could not be recovered from in his 1990 book me-163 , former messerschmitt me 163 pilot mano ziegler claims that his friend , test pilot heini dittmar , broke the sound barrier while diving the rocket plane , and that several people on the ground heard the sonic booms he claims that on 6 july 1944 , dittmar , flying me 163b v18 , bearing the alphabetic code va+sp , was measured traveling at a speed of 1,130 & nbsp ; km/h ( 702 & nbsp ; mph ) '' historical footnote : on march 1st 1945 , did lothar sieber become the first person to break the sound barrier ? '' doug 's darkworld : war , science , and philosophy in a fractured world , november 25 , 2008 by september 1944 , v-2s routinely achieved mach 4 ( 1,200 & nbsp ; m/s , or 3044 & nbsp ; mph ) during terminal descent in 1942 , the united kingdom 's ministry of aviation began a top-secret project with miles aircraft to develop the world 's first aircraft capable of breaking the sound barrier the project resulted in the development of the prototype miles m.52 turbojet-powered aircraft , which was designed to reach 1,000 & nbsp ; mph ( 417 & nbsp ; m/s ; 1,600 & nbsp ; km/h ) ( over twice the existing speed record ) in level flight , and to climb to an altitude of 36,000 & nbsp ; ft ( 11 & nbsp ; km ) in 1 & nbsp ; minute 30 & nbsp ; seconds image : m52 model.jpg thumb left one of the vickers models undergoing supersonic wind-tunnel testing at the royal aircraft establishment ( rae ) around 1946 another critical addition was the use of a power-operated stabilator , also known as the all-moving tail or flying tail , a key to supersonic flight control , which contrasted with traditional hinged tailplanes ( horizontal stabilizers ) connected mechanically to the pilots control column conventional control surfaces became ineffective at the high subsonic speeds then being achieved by fighters in dives , due to the aerodynamic forces caused by the formation of shockwaves at the hinge and the rearward movement of the centre of pressure , which together could override the control forces that could be applied mechanically by the pilot , hindering recovery from the dive a major impediment to early transonic flight was control reversal , the phenomenon which caused flight inputs ( stick , rudder ) to switch direction at high speed ; it was the cause of many accidents and near-accidents finally , the design included another critical element the use of a inlet cone in the nose to slow the incoming air to the subsonic speeds needed by the engine although the project was eventually cancelled , the research was used to construct an unmanned missile that went on to achieve a speed of mach 1.38 in a successful , controlled transonic and supersonic level test flight ;

ft ( 13.7 & nbsp ; km ) on 14 october 1947 , just under a month after the united states air force had been created as a separate service , the tests culminated in the first manned supersonic flight , piloted by air force captain chuck yeager in aircraft 46-062 , which he had christened glamorous glennis xs-1 flight number 50 is the first one where the x-1 recorded supersonic flight , at mach 1.06 ( 361 & nbsp ; m/s , 1,299 & nbsp ; km/h , 807.2 & nbsp ; mph ) peak speed ; however , yeager and many other personnel believe that flight 49 ( also with yeager piloting ) , which reached a top recorded speed of mach 0.997 ( 339 & nbsp ; m/s , 1,221 & nbsp ; km/h ) , may have , in fact , exceeded mach 1 on 21 august 1961 , a douglas dc-8 ( registration n9604z ) unofficially exceeded mach 1 in a controlled dive during a test flight at edwards air force base , as observed and reported by the flight crew ;
