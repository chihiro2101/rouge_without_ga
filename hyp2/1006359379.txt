machine vision as a systems engineering discipline can be considered distinct from computer vision , a form of basic computer science ; machine vision attempts to integrate existing technologies in new ways and apply them to solve real world problems in a way that meets the requirements of industrial automation and similar application areas machine vision is practically the only term used for these functions in industrial automation applications ; the term is less universal for these functions in other environments such as security and vehicle guidance the information can be used for such applications as automatic inspection and robot and process guidance in industry , for security monitoring and vehicle guidance definitions of the term '' machine vision '' vary , but all include the technology and methods used to extract information from an image on an automated basis , as opposed to image processing , where the output is another image the overall process includes planning the details of the requirements and project , and then creating a solution the overall process includes planning the details of the requirements and project , and then creating a solution however , the editor-in-chief of an mv trade magazine asserted that '' machine vision is not an industry per se '' but rather '' the integration of technologies and products that provide services or applications that benefit true industries such as automotive or consumer goods manufacturing , agriculture , and defense additionally , output types include numerical measurement data , data read from codes and characters , counts and classification of objects , displays of the process or results , stored images , alarms from automated space monitoring mv systems , and process control signals the term is also used in a broader sense by trade shows and trade groups such as the automated imaging association and the european machine vision association hybrid structured light for scalable depth sensing yueyi zhang , zhiwei xiong , feng wu university of science and technology of china , hefei , china microsoft research asia , beijing , china r.morano , c.ozturk , r.conn , s.dubin , s.zietz , j.nissano , '' structured light using pseudorandom codes '' , ieee transactions on pattern analysis and machine intelligence 20 ( 3 ) ( 1998 ) 322â€“327 this field encompasses a large number of technologies , software and hardware products , integrated systems , actions , methods and expertise mv software packages and programs developed in them then employ various digital image processing techniques to extract the required information , and often make decisions ( such as pass/fail ) based on the extracted information the first step in the automatic inspection sequence of operation is digital imaging , typically using cameras , lenses , and lighting that has been designed to provide the differentiation required by subsequent processing the value is then used to separate portions of the image , and sometimes to transform each portion of the image to simply black and white based on whether it is below or above that grayscale value west , perry high speed , real-time machine vision cyberoptics , pages 1-38 though the vast majority of machine vision applications are solved using two-dimensional imaging , machine vision applications utilizing 3d imaging are a growing niche within the industry
