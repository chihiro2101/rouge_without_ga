on the city side it reads , '' spql '' and is framed by the years 1477 and 1871 , the former being the supposed date of construction ( the correct date is , however , now known to be 1478 ) , the latter being the date of the gate 's restoration and the founding of the german reich the current guinness world record for the fastest marathon dressed as a landmark building was achieved by a richard mietz wearing a holstentor costume at the 2018 berlin marathon the amphicar ( a mass-produced amphibious automobile ) built in lübeck in the 1960s , sports a golden image of the holstentor on the horn button in the center of the steering wheel relics from historic lübeck were presented , the development of medieval lübeck was shown by using models and pictures , and models of the ships of the hanseatic league and the flagship '' eagle of lübeck '' were exhibited the gate now known as the holsten gate is the former middle holsten gate ; there was also an ( older ) inner holsten gate , an outer holsten gate , and even a fourth gate , known as the second outer holsten gate three gates gave access to the city : the citadel gate in the north , mill gate in the south , and the holsten gate in the west the designations '' holsten bridge '' ( and '' holsten gate '' ) are simply a consequence of the fact that the city 's western exit was in the direction of holstein on the other side there is the brick expressionist holsten gate hall ( '' holstentorhalle '' ) between the historic salt warehouses and the dgb 's house of trade unions ( '' gewerkschaftshaus '' ) this inscription is also from 1871 and is a shortened form of the text which had previously been on the ( not preserved ) foregate : '' concordia domi et pax foris sane res est omnium pulcherrima '' ( '' harmony within and peace without are indeed the greatest good of all '' ; see '' outer holsten gate '' below ) since 1926 there has been a stylization of the holsten gate in the emblem of the german association of cities ( deutscher städtetag dst ) although this is a city view from the eastern , wakenitz side of the old inner city hill , the artist has folded out essential parts of the gate 's west side , so that they too become visible the holsten gate square ( '' holstentorplatz '' ) is enclosed on one side by a branch of the deutsche bundesbank ; with new construction extending the original reichsbank building to the rear the half-timbered gate was replaced by a simple iron gate in 1794 , which in turn was demolished in 1828 , together with the tollkeeper 's house and the city wall along the trave river the side facing west ( away from the city ) is called the '' field side '' , the side facing the city the '' city side '' there is good evidence for the appearance of the gate erected at that time in a woodcut of a view of the city of lübeck produced by elias diebel the gate now known as the citadel gate is the former interior citadel gate ; the middle and outer citadel gates no longer exist at an unknown date in the 17th century , the inner holsten gate was replaced by a smaller , simple half-timbered gate—possibly because no point was seen in having a strong inner gate in light of the strong outer fortifications which had been erected in the meantime but since this picture shows the holstentor gate in the middle of a fantasy landscape of mountains and forests the credibility of the representation is disputed indeed , in 1855 , lübeck citizens petitioned the senate to finally demolish the remaining gate , since it hindered the extension of the railway facilities the rich and wealthy hanseatic city of lübeck felt the need in the course of the centuries to protect itself from outside threats with ever stronger walls and fortifications it was then considered to be only as a matter of time before the middle holsten gate , the only remaining of the four gates , would be torn down as of 2006 , the museum has been managed by the cultural foundation of the hanseatic city of lübeck the archways bore the inscriptions '' si deus pro nobis , quis contra nos '' ( '' if god be for us , who can be against us ? '' on the city side and '' sub alis altissimi ( '' under the protection of the most high '' on the field side the pediment was also not faithfully restored , but this is not the fault of the restorers , since in the 19th century it had long been gone and its original appearance was unknown so the history of the holsten gate is actually the history of four consecutive gates , although only one of them is left it was decided to build another gate—the outer holsten gate , later known as the middle holsten gate and today only as the holsten gate the holsten gate is located in the lübeck city wall complex on the main access road connecting the main railway station with the suburb of st in 1948 it appeared on the four highest denominations ( dm 1 , dm 2 , dm 3 and dm 5 ) of the first long-term series of postage stamps in german mark currency , which featured buildings it would also have been pointless , since the view of the lower parts of the holsten gate from the city side was obscured by high walls this building was altered with funds from the possehl foundation to create a rehearsal and teaching facility for lübeck 's university of music ( '' musikhochschule lübeck '' ) was rebuilt thus august reichensperger wrote in 1852 , '' even lübeck , once the proud head of the hanseatic league , does not seem able to endure the reflection of its former glory the restoration was estimated to cost around one million euros , with 498,000 euros ( the originally planned cost ) being provided by the german foundation for monument protection and the possehl foundation it has four floors , except for the ground floor of the central block , where the gate 's passageway is located in 1808 the second outer holsten gate was demolished , in 1828 the inner holsten gate , and in 1853 the outer holsten gate at the beginning of the 17th century new city walls were built in front of the city moat , under the supervision of military engineer johhann von brüssel the exterior holsten gate was also known as the renaissance gate , the foregate or the crooked gate in 1873 they were placed in front of the hotel stadt hamburg am klingenberg until its destruction in 1942 during world war ii , and only later in front of the holsten gate connected to the gate was the home of the wall master , who was responsible for the maintenance of the fortifications the reasoning during construction may have been to be able to quickly destroy the gate from the city side in an emergency , so that it would not fall into enemy hands as a bulwark
