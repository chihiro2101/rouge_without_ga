) diabetes intravenous drug users regular contact with someone who used drugs in the past year users of quinolone antibiotics elderly people school children sharing sports and other equipment college students living in dormitories people staying or working in a health-care facility for an extended period of time people who spend time in coastal waters where mrsa is present , such as some beaches in florida and the west coast of the united states people who spend time in confined spaces with other people , including occupants of homeless shelters , prison inmates , and military recruits in basic training veterinarians , livestock handlers , and pet owners people who ingest unpasteurized milk people who are immunocompromised and also colonized people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease people who have had thoracic surgery as many as 22 % of people infected with mrsa do not have any discernable risk factors to prevent the spread of mrsa in the home , health departments recommend laundering materials that have come into contact with infected persons separately and with a dilute bleach solution ; to reduce the bacterial load in one 's nose and skin ; and to clean and disinfect those things in the house that people regularly touch , such as sinks , tubs , kitchen counters , cell phones , light switches , doorknobs , phones , toilets , and computer keyboards guidance on how many toilets to provide and what sort of washing facilities should be provided alongside them is given in the workplace ( health , safety and welfare ) approved code of practice and guidance l24 , available from health and safety executive books , but no legal obligations exist on local authorities in the united kingdom to provide public toilets , and although in 2008 , the house of commons communities and local government committee called for a duty on local authorities to develop a public toilet strategy , this was rejected by the government the estimated incidence is 4.5 nosocomial infections per 100 admissions , with direct costs ( at 2004 prices ) ranging from 10,500 ( £5300 , €8000 at 2006 rates ) per case ( for bloodstream , urinary tract , or respiratory infections in immunocompetent people ) to 111,000 ( £57,000 , €85,000 ) per case for antibiotic-resistant infections in the bloodstream in people with transplants owing to the size of the sccmec element and the constraints of horizontal gene transfer , a minimum of five clones are thought to be responsible for the spread of mrsa infections , with clonal complex ( cc ) 8 most prevalent a mrsa strain , cc398 , is found in intensively reared production animals ( primarily pigs , but also cattle and poultry ) , where it can be transmitted to humans as la-mrsa ( livestock-associated mrsa ) across europe , based mostly on data from 2013 , seven countries ( iceland , norway , sweden , the netherlands , denmark , finland , and estonia , from lowest to highest ) had low levels of hospital-acquired mrsa infections compared to the others , and among countries with higher levels , significant improvements had been made only in bulgaria , poland , and the british isles the meca gene , which confers resistance to a number of antibiotics , is always present in mrsa and usually absent in mssa ; however , in some instances , the meca gene is present in mssa but is not expressed a select few of the populations at risk include : people with indwelling implants , prostheses , drains , and catheters people who are frequently in crowded places , especially with shared equipment and skin-to-skin contact people with weak immune systems ( hiv/aids , lupus , or cancer sufferers ; transplant recipients ; severe asthmatics ; etc people who are hospitalized , including the elderly , are often immunocompromised and susceptible to infection of all kinds , including mrsa ; an infection by mrsa is called healthcare-associated or hospital-acquired methicillin-resistant s a population-based study of the incidence of mrsa infections in san francisco during 2004–05 demonstrated that nearly one in 300 residents suffered from such an infection in the course of a year and that greater than 85 % of these infections occurred outside of the healthcare setting still , because no quick and easy method exists to diagnose mrsa , initial treatment of the infection is often based upon '' strong suspicion '' and techniques by the treating physician ; these include quantitative pcr procedures , which are employed in clinical laboratories for quickly detecting and identifying mrsa strains in the '' search and destroy '' strategy that was employed by all uk hospitals until the mid-1990s , all hospitalized people with mrsa were immediately isolated , and all staff were screened for mrsa and were prevented from working until they had completed a course of eradication therapy that was proven to work many of these infections are less serious , but the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) estimate that there are 80,461 invasive mrsa infections and 11,285 deaths due to mrsa annually children and adults who come in contact with day-care centers , playgrounds , locker rooms , camps , dormitories , classrooms and other school settings , and gyms and workout facilities are at higher risk of contracting mrsa in taiwan , st59 strains , some of which are resistant to many non-beta-lactam antibiotics , have arisen as common causes of skin and soft tissue infections in the community ca-mrsa has a greater spectrum of antimicrobial susceptibility to sulfa drugs ( like co-trimoxazole ( trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole ) , tetracyclines ( like doxycycline and minocycline ) and clindamycin ( for osteomyelitis ) according to the cdc , the most recent estimates of the incidence of healthcare-associated infections that are attributable to mrsa in the united states indicate a decline in such infection rates combined with extra sanitary measures for those in contact with infected people , swab screening people admitted to hospitals has been found to be effective in minimizing the spread of mrsa in hospitals in the united states , denmark , finland , and the netherlands specialized culture media have been developed to better differentiate between mssa and mrsa and , in some cases , such media can be used to identify specific strains that are resistant to different antibiotics as a consequence of the inability of pbp2a to interact with β-lactam moieties , acquisition of meca confers resistance to all β-lactam antibiotics in addition to methicillin as shown in an animal study with diabetic mice , the topical application of a mixture of sugar ( 70 % ) and 3 % povidone-iodine paste is an effective agent for the treatment of diabetic ulcers with mrsa infection there are concerns that the presence of mrsa in the environment may allow resistance to be transferred to other bacteria through phages ( viruses that infect bacteria ) in 1961 , the first known mrsa isolates were reported in a british study , and from 1961 to 1967 , infrequent hospital outbreaks occurred in western europe and australia , with methicillin then being licensed in england to treat resistant infections additional recommendations are to keep wounds clean and covered , avoid contact with other people 's wounds , avoid sharing personal items such as razors or towels , shower after exercising at athletic facilities , and shower before using swimming pools or whirlpools the first report of community-associated mrsa ( ca-mrsa ) occurred in 1981 , and in 1982 , a large outbreak of ca-mrsa occurred among intravenous drug users in detroit , michigan as of 2013 , no randomized clinical trials had been conducted to understand how to treat nonsurgical wounds that had been colonized , but not infected , with mrsa , and insufficient studies had been conducted to understand how to treat surgical wounds that had been colonized with mrsa the review authors concluded that there is a need for randomized controlled trials to be conducted to help determine if the use of gloves , gowns , and masks reduces the transmission of mrsa in hospitals . this is due to a resistance gene , meca , which stops β-lactam antibiotics from inactivating the enzymes ( transpeptidases ) critical for cell wall synthesis blai and blar1 are homologous to meci and mecr1 , respectively , and normally function as regulators of blaz , which is responsible for penicillin resistance ceftaroline , a fifth-generation cephalosporin , is the first beta-lactam antibiotic approved in the us to treat mrsa infections in skin and soft tissue or community-acquired pneumonia the centers for disease control and prevention offers suggestions for preventing the contraction and spread of mrsa infection which are applicable to those in community settings , including incarcerated populations , childcare center employees , and athletes in the united kingdom , the workplace ( health , safety and welfare ) regulations 1992 require businesses to provide toilets for their employees , along with washing facilities including soap or other suitable means of cleaning historically , major mrsa clones st2470-mrsa-i , st239-mrsa-iii , st5-mrsa-ii , and st5-mrsa-iv were responsible for causing hospital-acquired mrsa ( ha-mrsa ) infections aureus ( mssa ) , mrsa is slow-growing on a variety of media and has been found to exist in mixed colonies of mssa in the united states , most cases of ca-mrsa are caused by a cc8 strain designated st8 : usa300 , which carries sccmec type iv , panton–valentine leukocidin , psm-alpha and enterotoxins q and k , and st1 : usa400 livestock associated mrsa ( la-mrsa ) has been observed in korea , brazil , switzerland , malaysia , india , great britain , denmark , and china treatment varies for mrsa infections related to : subperiosteal abscesses , necrotizing pneumonia , cellulitis , pyomyositis , necrotizing fasciitis , mediastinitis , myocardial , perinephric , hepatic , and splenic abscesses , septic thrombophlebitis , and severe ocular infections , including endophthalmitis a 2015 cochrane systematic review aimed to assess the effectiveness of wearing gloves , gowns and masks to help stop the spread of mrsa in hospitals , however no eligible studies were identified for inclusion emrsa16 has been found to be identical to the st36 : usa200 strain , which circulates in the united states , and to carry the sccmec type ii , enterotoxin a and toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 genes carriage of large plasmids , such as sccmeci–iii , is costly to the bacteria , resulting in a compensatory decrease in virulence expression in humans , staphylococcus aureus is part of the normal microbiota present in the upper respiratory tract , and on skin and in the gut mucosa furthermore , with mrsa 's high contagion rate , a common risk factor is individuals who are in constant contact with someone who has injected drugs in the past year meca is a biomarker gene responsible for resistance to methicillin and other β-lactam antibiotics mrsa is able to thrive in hospital settings with increased antibiotic resistance but decreased virulence – ha-mrsa targets immunocompromised , hospitalized hosts , thus a decrease in virulence is not maladaptive in many nations of the world , mrsa strains with different genetic background types have come to predominate among ca-mrsa strains ; usa300 easily tops the list in the u.s however , in 2011 , a variant of vancomycin was tested that binds to the lactate variation and also binds well to the original target , thus reinstating potent antimicrobial activity as of early 2005 , the number of deaths in the united kingdom attributed to mrsa has been estimated by various sources to lie in the area of 3,000 per year this is further proven by molecular typing of ca-mrsa strains and genome comparison between ca-mrsa and ha-mrsa , which indicate that novel mrsa strains integrated sccmec into mssa separately on its own glycopeptides , cephalosporins , and in particular , quinolones are associated with an increased risk of colonisation of mrsa moreover , the efficacy of vancomycin against mrsa is inferior to that of anti-staphylococcal beta-lactam antibiotics against methicillin-susceptible s a report released by the university of chicago children 's hospital comparing two periods ( 1993–1995 and 1995–1997 ) found a 25-fold increase in the rate of hospitalizations due to mrsa among children in the united states people in nursing homes are at risk for all the reasons above , further complicated by their generally weaker immune systems a 1,000-year-old collyrium recipe found in the medieval bald 's leechbook at the british library , one of the earliest known medical textbooks , was found to have activity against mrsa in vitro and in skin wounds in mice examples of such elements include plasmids , transposable element , and genomic islands , which can be transferred between bacteria through horizontal gene transfer antibiotic use in livestock increases the risk that mrsa will develop among the livestock ; strains mrsa st 398 and cc398 are transmissible to humans community-acquired mrsa ( ca-mrsa ) strains emerged in late 1990 to 2000 , infecting healthy people who had not been in contact with healthcare facilities for example , in australia , st93 strains are common , while in continental europe st80 strains , which carry sccmec type iv , predominate , usa300 was found only rarely in a study of mrsa strains from outbreaks in 1996 and 2000 as well as in surveillance from 2004–06 linezolid , quinupristin/dalfopristin , daptomycin , ceftaroline , and tigecycline are used to treat more severe infections that do not respond to glycopeptides such as vancomycin however , along with similar bacterial species that can colonize and act symbiotically , they can cause disease if they begin to take over the tissues they have colonized or invade other tissues ; the resultant infection has been called a '' pathobiont '' normally , a bacterium must be cultured from blood , urine , sputum , or other body-fluid samples , and in sufficient quantities to perform confirmatory tests early-on specifically , these are : cinnamic acid , cinnamyl cinnamate , ethyl cinnamate , benzyl cinnamate , styrene , vanillin , cinnamyl alcohol , 2-phenylpropyl alcohol , and 3-phenylpropyl cinnamate several studies , however , including one by blot and colleagues , that have adjusted for underlying disease still found mrsa bacteremia to have a higher attributable mortality than methicillin-susceptible s
