an example of the breadth and types of agriculture policy concerns can be found in the australian bureau of agricultural and resource economics article '' agricultural economies of australia and new zealand '' which says that the major challenges and issues faced by their industrial agriculture industry are : marketing challenges and consumer tastes international trading environment ( world market conditions , barriers to trade , quarantine and technical barriers , maintenance of global competitiveness and market image , and management of biosecurity issues affecting imports and the disease status of exports ) biosecurity ( pests and diseases such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( bse ) , avian influenza , foot and mouth disease , citrus canker , and sugarcane smut ) infrastructure ( such as transport , ports , telecommunications , energy and irrigation facilities ) management skills and labor supply ( with increasing requirements for business planning , enhanced market awareness , the use of modern technology such as computers and global positioning systems and better agronomic management , modern farm managers will need to become increasingly skilled examples : training of skilled workers , the development of labor hire systems that provide continuity of work in industries with strong seasonal peaks , modern communication tools , investigating market opportunities , researching customer requirements , business planning including financial management , researching the latest farming techniques , risk management skills ) coordination ( a more consistent national strategic agenda for agricultural research and development ; more active involvement of research investors in collaboration with research providers developing programs of work ; greater coordination of research activities across industries , research organisations and issues ; and investment in human capital to ensure a skilled pool of research personnel in the future ) technology ( research , adoption , productivity , genetically modified ( gm ) crops , investments ) water ( access rights , water trade , providing water for environmental outcomes , assignment of risk in response to the reallocation of water from consumptive to environmental use , accounting for the sourcing and allocation of water ) resource access issues ( management of native vegetation , the protection and enhancement of biodiversity , sustainability of productive agricultural resources , landholder responsibilities ) in addition , a recent natural resource perspective paper by the overseas development institute found that good infrastructure , education and effective information services in rural areas were necessary to improve the chances of making agriculture work for the poor the biosecurity concerns facing industrial agriculture can be illustrated by : the threat to poultry and humans from h5n1 ; possibly caused by the use of animal vaccines the threat to cattle and humans from bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( bse ) ; possibly caused by the unnatural feeding of cattle to cattle to minimize costs the threat to industry profits from diseases like foot-and-mouth disease and citrus canker which increasing globalization makes harder to contain in fact , the root cause of the continuing h5n1 pandemic threat may be the way the pathogenicity of h5n1 viruses is masked by co-circulating influenza viruses or bad agricultural vaccines wendy barclay , a virologist at the university of reading , uk said : '' the chinese have made a vaccine based on reverse genetics made with h5n1 antigens , and they have been using it there has been a lot of criticism of what they have done because they have protected their chickens against death from this virus but the chickens still get infected , and then you get the drift - the virus mutates in response to the antibodies - and now we have a situation where we have five or six 'flavours ' of h5n1 out there bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( bse ) , commonly known as '' mad cow disease '' , is a fatal , neurodegenerative disease of cattle , which infects by a mechanism that surprised biologists upon its discovery in the late 20th century in humans , it is known as new variant creutzfeldt–jakob disease ( vcjd or nvcjd ) , and by june 2007 , it had killed 165 people in britain , and six elsewhere '' variant creutzfeldt–jakob disease , june 2007 '' , the national creutzfeldt–jakob disease surveillance unit , university of edinburgh a british inquiry into bse concluded that the epidemic was caused by feeding cattle , who are normally herbivores , the remains of other cattle in the form of meat and bone meal ( mbm ) , which caused the infectious agent to spread the current scientific view is that infectious proteins called prions developed through spontaneous mutation , probably in the 1970s , and there is a possibility that the use of organophosphate increased the susceptibility of cattle to the disease it can also infect deer , goats , sheep , and other bovids with cloven-hoof , as well as elephants , rats , and hedgehogs the clothes and skin of animal handlers such as farmers , standing water , and uncooked food scraps and feed supplements containing infected animal products can harbor the virus as well there is no cross-protection between serotypes ( meaning that a vaccine for one serotype wo n't protect against any others ) and in addition , two strains within a given serotype may have dna sequences that differ by as much as 30 % for a given gene the disease , which is believed to have originated in south east asia , is extremely persistent when it becomes established in an area , making it necessary for all citrus orchards to be destroyed for the successful eradication of the disease the united nations food and agriculture organization ( fao ) defines food security as existing when '' all people , at all times , have physical and economic access to sufficient safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life '' the four qualifications that must be met for a food secure system include physical availability , economic and physical access , appropriate utilization , and stability of the prior three elements over time as the global population grows to 9 billion by 2050 , and as diets shift to emphasize higher energy products and greater overall consumption , food systems will be subjected to even greater pressure climate change presents additional threats to food security , affecting crop yields , distribution of pests and diseases , weather patterns , and growing seasons around the world food security has thus become an increasingly important topic in agricultural policy as decision makers attempt to reduce poverty and malnutrition while augmenting adaptive capacity to climate change the commission on sustainable agriculture and climate change listed high-priority policy actions to address food security , including integrating food security and sustainable agriculture into global and national policies , significantly raising the level of global investment in food systems , and developing specific programs and policies to support the most vulnerable populations ( namely , those that are already subject to food insecurity ) 'food sovereignty ' , a term coined by members of via campesina in 1996 , '' global small-scale farmers ' movement developing new trade regimes '' , food first news & views , volume 28 , number 97 spring/summer 2005 , p.2 advocates of food sovereignty put the people who produce , distribute , and consume food at the centre of decisions on food systems and policies , rather than the demands of markets and corporations that they believe have come to dominate the global food system an agricultural subsidy is a governmental subsidy paid to farmers and agribusinesses to manage the agricultural industry as one part of the various methods a government uses in a mixed economy the conditions for payment and the reasons for the individual specific subsidies vary with farm product , size of the farm , nature of ownership , and country among other factors enriching peanut farmers for political purposes , keeping the price of a staple low to keep the poor from rebelling , stabilizing the production of a crop to avoid famine years , encouraging diversification and many other purposes have been suggested as the reason for specific subsidies a government can erect trade barriers to limit the number of goods imported ( in the case of a quota share ) or enact tariffs to raise the domestic price of imported products some argue that nations have an interest in assuring there is sufficient domestic production capability to meet domestic needs in the event of a global supply disruption in the united states , 65 % of the approximately 16.5 billion in annual subsidies went to the top 10 % of farmers in 2002 because subsidies are linked to certain commodities the heritage foundation ( 2004 ) the heritage foundation on the other hand , organic farming received 5 million for help in certification and 15 million for research over a 5-year time period some advocate fair trade rules to ensure that poor farmers in developing nations that produce crops primarily for export are not exploited or negatively impacted by trade policies , practices , tariffs , and agreements which benefit one competitor at the expense of another - which advocates consider a dangerous '' race to the bottom '' in agricultural labor and safety standards opponents point out that most agriculture in developed nations is produced by industrial corporations ( agribusiness ) which are hardly deserving of sympathy , and that the alternative to exploitation is poverty therefore , the biggest impediment to the growth of small farming and therefore of fare trade in sectors beyond coffee and bananas , is these quality demands from the rich world '' ( lyle vanclief , former canadian minister of agriculture 1997-2003 ) according to the institute for agriculture and trade policy , corn , soybeans , cotton , wheat and rice are sold below the cost of production , or dumped dumping rates are approximately forty percent for wheat , between twenty-five and thirty percent for corn ( maize ) , approximately thirty percent for soybeans , fifty-seven percent for cotton , and approximately twenty percent for rice according to oxfam , '' if developed nations eliminated subsidy programs , the export value of agriculture in lesser developed nations would increase by 24 % , plus a further 5.5 % from tariff equilibrium '' free trade advocates desire the elimination of all market distorting mechanisms ( subsidies , tariffs , regulations ) and argue that , as with free trade in all areas , this will result in aggregate benefit for all new greenhouse methods , hydroponics , fertilizers , r/o water processors , hybrid crops , fast-growing hybrid trees for quick shade , interior temperature control , greenhouse or tent insulation , autonomous building gardens , sun lamps , mylar , fans , and other cheap tech can be used to grow crops on previously unarable land , such as rocky , mountainous , desert , and even arctic lands instead of buying the sugar from polynesia , a nation can make sugar from sugar beets , maple sap , or sweetener from stevia plant , keeping the profits circulating within the nation 's economy market interventions may increase the cost to consumers for agricultural products , either via hidden wealth-transfers via the government , or increased prices at the consumer level , such as for sugar and peanuts in the us while this has diminished the distortions created by the common agricultural policy , many critics argue that a greater focus on the provision of public goods , such as biodiversity and clean water , is needed the wto has extracted commitments from the philippines government , making it lower import barriers to half their present levels over a span of six years , and allowing in drastically increased competition from the industrialised and heavily subsidised farming systems of north america and europe a recent oxfam report estimated that average household incomes of maize farmers will be reduced by as much as 30 % over the six years as cheap imports from the us drive down prices in the local markets the report estimates that in the absence of trade restrictions , us subsidised maize could be marketed at less than half the price of maize grown on the philippine island of mindanao ; and that the livelihoods of up to half a million filipino maize farmers ( out of the total 1.2 million ) are under immediate threat .
