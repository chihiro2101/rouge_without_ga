according to the nippon kyūdō federation the supreme goal of kyūdō is the state of shin-zen-bi , roughly '' truth-goodness-beauty '' , kyudo manual , volume 1 , all nippon kyudo federation ( revised edition ) which can be approximated as : when archers shoot correctly ( i.e the all nippon kyudo federation ( ankf ) , the main governing body of kyūdō in japan , has codified the hassetsu ( or '' eight stages of shooting '' ) in the kyūdō kyohon ( '' kyūdō manual '' ) lidin , nordic institute of asian studies , nias press , 2002 p.1-14 the japanese soon started to manufacture their own version of the matchlock called tanegashima and eventually it and the yari ( spear ) became the weapons of choice over the yumi during the draw , the thumb of the archer is typically placed on the last gloved finger of the drawing hand , with the first ( or , in the case of a yotsugake , the first and index fingers ) being placed gently on either the thumb or the arrow shaft itself tōshiya - the tōshiya , '' passing arrow '' , or '' the arrows which hit the target '' , was an archery exhibition contest held on the west veranda of sanjūsangen-dō temple in kyoto , japan using a system which is common to modern budō ( martial art ) practices , most western kyūdō schools periodically hold examinations , which , if the archer passes , results in the conveying of a grade , which can be kyū or dan level in kyūdō there are three kinds of practice ( geiko ) : mitori geiko & nbsp ; – receiving with the eyes the style and technique of an advanced archer , kufū geiko & nbsp ; – learning and keeping in mind the details of the technique and spiritual effort to realize it and kazu geiko & nbsp ; – repetition through which the technique is personified in one 's own shooting when many of the japanese were interned in camps , during the world war , all of the groups ( except the hawaii kyudo kai ) disbanded ; the hawaii kyudo kai simply quietly practiced almost in secret in the latter part of the 15th century heki danjō masatsugu revolutionized archery with his new and accurate approach called hi , kan , chū ( fly , pierce , center ) , and his footman 's archery spread rapidly to give oneself completely to the shooting is the spiritual goal , achieved by perfection of both the spirit and shooting technique leading to munen musō , '' no thoughts , no illusions '' this popular view is likely the result of a single book zen in the art of archery ( 1948 ) by the german author eugen herrigel the changing of society and the military class ( samurai ) taking power at the end of the first millennium created a requirement for education in archery to harmonize practice and ceremonial shooting ( sharei ) in 1953 the all nippon kyūdō federation ( ankf ) formed an establishing committee from the main schools to take the best elements of each school and form the ankf style that is used today throughout japan and in most kyūdō federations in the west earlier archery had been called kyūjutsu , the skill of bow , but monks acting even as martial arts teachers led to creation of a new concept : kyūdō during the changes to japan brought by opening up to the outside world at the beginning of the meiji era ( 1868–1912 ) , the samurai lost their status hirokazu kosaka ; by 1976 ( at the request of an original member of the los angeles kyudo kai , who belonged to the group in the 1920s ) they had renamed their fledgling group 'the los angeles kai ' with the exception of the ippongake , the yugake is worn with an underglove called a shitagake made of cotton or synthetic cloth , mainly to protect the yugake from sweat which would degrade the deerskin of the glove over time this led to the birth of the first kyujutsu ryūha ( style ) , the henmi-ryū , founded by henmi kiyomitsu in the 12th century judo , karate ) , kyūdō is one of the japanese martial arts that has not seen large amounts of mainstream interest in the west in japan , most dōjōs have roughly the same layout ; an entrance , a large dōjō area , typically with a wooden floor and a high ceiling , a position for practice targets ( called makiwara ) , and a large open wall with sliding doors , which , when opened , overlooks an open grassy area and a separate building , the matoba which houses a sand hillock and the targets , placed 28 metres from the dōjō floor the archer steps onto the line from where arrows are shot ( known as the shai ) and turns to face the kamiza , so that the left side of the archer 's body faces the target kasagake - a type of japanese mounted archery ; in contrast to yabusame , the types of targets are various and the archer shoots without stopping the horse yamada shōji , the myth of zen in the art of archery , japanese journal of religious studies 2001 28/1–2 zen , archery , enlightenment 2002 pp4-7 in the 1980s , shibata sensei xx was invited by chögyam trungpa to the karmê chöling tibetan buddhist monastery in vermont , where he demonstrated kyūdō for the first time in the united states genishiro inagaki , 1980 in bagge 2001 , kyudo - japanilainen jousiammunta , in this respect , many kyūdō practitioners believe that competition , examination , and any opportunity that places the archer in this uncompromising situation is important , while other practitioners will avoid competitions or examinations of any kind with a soft glove , the thumb area is very flexible and is without a pre-made groove , allowing the practitioners to create their own , based on their own shooting habits in japan , generally the kyū ranks are only really tested for and achieved in high schools and colleges , with adults skipping the kyū ranks and moving straight on to the first dan resulting from the technique to release the shot , the bow will ( for a practised archer ) spin in the hand so that the string stops in front of the archer 's outer forearm in addition to the hassetsu , the archer must also perform an elaborate entering procedure whereby the archer will join up to four other archers to enter the dōjō , bow to the adjudicators , step up to the back line known as the honza and then kneel in a form of sitting known as kiza yumi shafts are traditionally made of bamboo , wood and leather using techniques which have not changed for centuries , although some archers ( particularly , those new to the art ) may use synthetic ( i.e the extra finger allows for a stronger hold on the thumb , as it is then placed on the third finger of the hand instead of the second first in hawaii with the hawaii kyudo kai , and then on the mainland of the u.s the archers then bow to the mato in unison , stand , and take three steps forward to the shai line ( shooting line ) , and kneel again however , on rare occasions a bow hand glove , called an oshidegake , is used , which serves to protect the left thumb from injury from the arrow and fletching thumb because of the unique shooting technique of kyūdō , protection on the left ( bow ) arm is not generally required the archer then sights from the target to the feet and with the feet set apart so that the distance between them is equal to the archer 's yazuka , about half his body height , and equal to the length of an arrow green , martial arts of the world , 2001 the takeda-ryū and the mounted archery school ogasawara-ryū were later founded by his descendants kyūdō is practised in different schools and styles and even between dōjōs of the same style , the form of practice can vary the need for archers grew dramatically during the genpei war ( 1180–1185 ) and as a result the founder of the ogasawara-ryū ( ogasawara nagakiyo ) , began teaching yabusame ( mounted archery ) during the edo period ( 1603–1868 ) japan was turned inward as a hierarchical caste society in which the samurai were at the top however , it took until 1949 before the all japanese kyudo federation ( ankf ; japanese : zen nihon kyūdō renmei ) was formed the bow string , when properly released , will travel around the bow hand , coming to rest on the outside of the arm even so , herrigel 's book , when translated into japanese in 1956 , had a huge impact on perception of kyūdō also in japan the makiwara is shot at from a very close range ( about seven feet , or the length of the archer 's strung yumi when held horizontally from the centerline of the archer 's body ) during this period archery became a '' voluntary '' skill , practised partly in the court in ceremonial form , partly as different kinds of competition kyūdō dōjōs ( training halls , aka '' kyūdōjō '' ) vary in style and design from school to school , and from country to country
