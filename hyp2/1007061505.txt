one of the first examples of bicycles modified specifically for off-road use is the expedition of buffalo soldiers from missoula , montana , to yellowstone in august 1896 a typical bikepacking set-up includes a frame bag , handlebar roll , seat pack , and backpack and typical gear includes lightweight and basic camping gear , and a bike repair kit generally , bikepackers tend to cover anywhere from 25 to 75 miles ( 40 â€“ 120 & nbsp ; km ) in a given day as the riding can be technical injuries are a given factor when mountain biking , especially in the more extreme disciplines like downhill biking , free ride and dirt jumping injuries range from minor wounds , such as cuts and abrasions from falls on gravel or other surfaces , to major injuries such as broken bones , head or spinal injuries resulting from impacts with rocks , trees or the terrain being ridden on to reduce the risk of injury , a rider will also take steps to minimize the risk of accidents , and thus the potential for injury ; by choosing trails which fall within the range of their experience level , ensuring that they are fit enough to deal with the trail they have chosen , and keeping their bike in top mechanical condition since the widespread adoption of hydraulic and mechanical disk brakes on most mountain bikes from the late 1990s , the issues of brake pad wear , misalignment with , or slippage of rim brake pads on rims designed for rim brakes or '' v brakes '' , has become a non-issue examples of the education an advocacy group can provide include : educate local bicycle riders , property managers , and other user groups on the proper development of trails , and on the international mountain bicycling association 's ( imba ) , '' rules of the trail according to a review published by the international mountain bicycling association , the environmental impact of mountain biking , as a relatively new sport , is poorly understood mountain biking can result in both soil and vegetation damage , which can be caused by skidding , but also by the construction of unauthorised features such as jumps and bridges , and trails themselves several studies have reported that a mountain bike 's impact on a given length of trail surface is comparable to that of a hiker , and substantially less than that of an equestrian or motorized off-road vehicle the environmental impacts of mountain biking can be greatly reduced by not riding on wet or sensitive trails , keeping speeds modest so as to minimize cornering forces and braking forces , not skidding , and by staying on the trail to mitigate the accidental dispersal of an unwanted invasive species , the authors of the study proposed the following measures to support conservation : a ) clean the bike between rides in different habitats , before traveling and especially before entering sensitive natural areas and regions mountain bike mountain bike racing downhill mountain biking enduro ( mountain biking ) singletrack list of professional mountain bikers mountain bike hall of fame glossary of cycling
