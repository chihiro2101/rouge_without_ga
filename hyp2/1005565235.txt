a typical high-purity grade of lanolin is composed predominantly of long chain waxy esters ( approximately 97 % by weight ) with the remainder being lanolin alcohols , lanolin acids and lanolin hydrocarbons an estimated 8,000 to 20,000 different types of lanolin esters are present in lanolin , resulting from combinations between the 200 or so different lanolin acids and the 100 or so different lanolin alcohols identified so far lanolin â€™ s complex composition of long-chain esters , hydroxyesters , diesters , lanolin alcohols , and lanolin acids means in addition to it being a valuable product in its own right , it is also the starting point for the production of a whole spectrum of lanolin derivatives , which possess wide-ranging chemical and physical properties lanolin alcohols are a rich source of cholesterol ( an important skin lipid ) and are powerful water-in-oil emulsifiers ; they have been used extensively in skincare products for over 100 years despite only being in force for a short period of time , this ruling did harm both to the lanolin industry and to the reputation of lanolin in general the cosmetics directive ruling only applied to the presence of lanolin in cosmetic products ; it did not apply to the many hundreds of its different uses in dermatological products designed for the treatment of compromised skin conditions modern analytical methods have revealed lanolin possesses a number of important chemical and physical similarities to human stratum corneum lipids ; the lipids which help regulate the rate of water loss across the epidermis and govern the hydration state of the skin skin bioengineering studies have shown the durational effect of the emollient ( skin smoothing ) action produced by lanolin is very significant and lasts for many hours in a small clinical study conducted on volunteer subjects with terribly dry ( xerotic ) hands , lanolin was shown to be superior to petrolatum in reducing the signs and symptoms of dryness and scaling , cracks and abrasions , and pain and itch baseball players often use it to soften and break in their baseball gloves ( shaving cream with lanolin is popularly used for this ) mixed warm 1:12 with highly concentrated ethanol ( usually 99 % ) , the ethanol acts as a carrier which evaporates quickly after application , leaving a fine film of lanolin behind to prevent brass seizing in resizing dies lanolin , when mixed with ingredients such as neatsfoot oil , beeswax and glycerol , is used in various leather treatments , for example in some saddle soaps and in leather care products lanolin is extracted by washing the wool in hot water with a special wool scouring detergent to remove dirt , wool grease ( crude lanolin ) , suint ( sweat salts ) , and anything else stuck to the wool
