vocabulary is commonly defined as '' all the words known and used by a particular person '' a person 's receptive vocabulary is usually the larger of the two for example , although a young child may not yet be able to speak , write , or sign , he or she may be able to follow simple commands and appear to understand a good portion of the language to which they are exposed in this case , the child 's receptive vocabulary is likely tens , if not hundreds of words , but his or her active vocabulary is zero it is also possible for the productive vocabulary to be larger than the receptive vocabulary , for example in a second-language learner who has learned words through study rather than exposure , and can produce them , but has difficulty recognizing them in conversation productive vocabulary , therefore , generally refers to words that can be produced within an appropriate context and match the intended meaning of the speaker or signer as with receptive vocabulary , however , there are many degrees at which a particular word may be considered part of an active vocabulary this simply indicates that a word gradually enters a person 's vocabulary over a period of time as more aspects of word knowledge are learnt brysbaert m , stevens m , mandera p and keuleers e ( 2016 ) how many words do we know ? practical estimates of vocabulary size dependent on word definition , the degree of language input and the participant 's age a person 's speaking vocabulary is all the words they use in speech for example , if there are a number of synonyms , a writer may have a preference as to which of them to use , and they are unlikely to use technical vocabulary relating to a subject in which they have no knowledge or interest the american philosopher richard rorty characterized a person 's '' final vocabulary '' as follows : all human beings carry about a set of words which they employ to justify their actions , their beliefs , and their lives these are the words in which we formulate praise of our friends and contempt for our enemies , our long-term projects , our deepest self-doubts and our highest hopes… i shall call these words a person 's “ final vocabulary ” focal vocabulary is a specialized set of terms and distinctions that is particularly important to a certain group : those with a particular focus of experience or activity a lexicon , or vocabulary , is a language 's dictionary : its set of names for things , events , and ideas this results in a wide range of vocabulary by age five or six , when an english-speaking child will have learned about 1500 words estimating average vocabulary size poses various difficulties and limitations due to the different definitions and methods employed such as what is the word , what is to know a word , what sample dictionaries were used , how tests were conducted , and so on native speakers ' vocabularies also vary widely within a language , and are dependent on the level of the speaker 's education vocabulary learning is one of the first steps in learning a second language , but a learner never finishes vocabulary acquisition whether in one 's native language or a second language , the acquisition of new vocabulary is an ongoing process although memorization can be seen as tedious or boring , associating one word in the native language with the corresponding word in the second language until memorized is considered one of the best methods of vocabulary acquisition it does typically require a large amount of repetition , and spaced repetition with flashcards is an established method for memorization , particularly used for vocabulary acquisition in computer-assisted language learning when a word in the second language is phonologically or visually similar to a word in the native language , one often assumes they also share similar meanings when large amounts of vocabulary must be acquired in a limited amount of time , when the learner needs to recall information quickly , when words represent abstract concepts or are difficult to picture in a mental image , or when discriminating between false friends , rote memorization is the method to use one useful method of building vocabulary in a second language is the keyword method several word lists have been developed to provide people with a limited vocabulary either for the purpose of rapid language proficiency or for effective communication
