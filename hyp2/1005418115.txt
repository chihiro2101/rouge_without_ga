, with three players a , b and c ( starting on that order ) , if b is the first to cross the finish line , c is allowed one more move to complete the a-b-c cycle however , the most common and entertaining rule is that while the line segments are allowed to intersect , a car can not move to or through a grid point that is occupied by another car , as they would collide ) on each turn after that , the player can choose to move the same number of squares in the same direction as on the previous turn ; the grid point reached by this move is called the principal point for this turn before starting to play , the players may go over the track , agreeing in advance about each grid point near the boundaries as to whether that point is inside or outside the track note , however , that the circle of forces strictly applies to an individual tyre rather than an entire vehicle , that a slightly elongated ellipse would be more realistic than a circle , and that the theory of traction involving this circle or ellipse is quite simplified the rules for the game , and a sample track game was published by martin gardner in january 1973 in his '' mathematical games '' column in scientific american ; and it was again described in car and driver magazine , in july 1973 , page 65 , if the previous move was four squares to the right and two squares upwards , then the principal point is found by moving another four squares to the right and two more squares upwards usually , cars are required to stay on the track for the entire length of the move , not just the start and end as will follow from a later section , if the mathematical concept of vectors is known , some of the rules may be stated more briefly , if it runs off the track or collides , it receives 1 damage point for each square of the last movement , and comes to an immediate stand-still letter preprinted with a 1/4 '' square grid , or a4 with a 5 & nbsp ; mm square grid ) , a freehand loop is drawn as the outer boundary of the racetrack on heavily convoluted racetracks , allowing the line segment representing a move to cross the boundary twice ( with start and end points inside the track ) , some unreasonable shortcuts may be allowed it used similar rules to racetrack but on a hexagonal grid and with the spaceships being placed in the center of the grid cells rather than at the vertices it can be more or less parallel with the outer loop , or the track can have wider and narrower spots ( pinch spots ) , with usually at least two squares between the loops a player running off the track may be allowed to continue , but is required to brake and turn around , and re-enter the track again crossing the boundary at a point behind the point where it left each player chooses a color or mark ( such as x and o ) to represent the player 's car
