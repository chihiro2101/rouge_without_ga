4 , april 1996 to host a website on the internet , an individual or company would need their own computer or server as not all companies had the budget or expertise to do this , web hosting services began to offer to host users ' websites on their own servers , without the client needing to own the necessary infrastructure required to operate the website the owners of the websites , also called webmasters , would be able to create a website that would be hosted on the web hosting service 's server and published to the web by the web hosting service as the number of users on the world wide web grew , the pressure for companies , both large and small , to have an online presence grew the most basic is web page and small-scale file hosting , where files can be uploaded via file transfer protocol ( ftp ) or a web interface the company may use the computer as a website host to provide details of their goods and services and facilities for online orders also known as a virtual private server ( vps ) , divides server resources into virtual servers , where resources can be allocated in a way that does not directly reflect the underlying hardware vps will often be allocated resources based on a one server to many vpss relationship , however virtualisation may be done for a number of reasons , including the ability to move a vps container between servers the user gets his or her own web server but is not allowed full control over it ( user is denied root access for linux/administrator access for windows ) ; however , they are allowed to manage their data via ftp or other remote management tools similar to the dedicated web hosting service , but the user owns the colo server ; the hosting company provides physical space that the server takes up and takes care of the server in most cases , the colocation provider may provide little to no support directly for their client 's machine , providing only the electrical , internet access , and storage facilities for the server this is a new type of hosting platform that allows customers powerful , scalable and reliable hosting based on clustered load-balanced servers and utility billing cloud hosting also allows providers to charge users only for resources consumed by the user , rather than a flat fee for the amount the user expects they will use , or a fixed cost upfront hardware investment ( usually web hosts use clustered hosting for their shared hosting plans , as there are multiple benefits to the mass managing of clients ) the host may also provide an interface or control panel for managing the web server and installing scripts , as well as other modules and service applications like e-mail a web server that does not use a control panel for managing the hosting account , is often referred to as a '' headless '' server the availability of a website is measured by the percentage of a year in which the website is publicly accessible and reachable via the internet depending on the wording of an sla , if the availability of a system drops below that in the signed sla , a hosting provider often will provide a partial refund for time lost when a customer agrees to use a web hosting service , they are relinquishing control of the security of their site to the company that is hosting the site the level of security that a web hosting service offers is extremely important to a prospective customer and can be a major consideration when considering which provider a customer may choose
