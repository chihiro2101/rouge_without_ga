in 1693 , jakob ammann , '' together with the ministers and elders , '' sent a general letter to people within the swiss brethren congregations , asking for a meeting in which he wanted clarification about where they stood on three issues : 1 ) shunning those who had been banned , 2 ) whether liars should be excommunicated , and 3 ) if people could be saved who did not follow god â€™ s word another important aspect in the schism was a conference held at ohnenheim , alsace , by several swiss brethren ministers and elders in 1660 , in which they formally adopted the dordrecht confession of faith that had been drawn up by dutch mennonites in february 1700 , jakob ammann and several of his co-ministers removed the ban from the swiss ministers and excommunicated themselves in recognition that they had acted too rashly and had '' grievously erred because of their prominent roles , jakob ammann and hans reist have been used to characterize the two sides of the schism , but the issues were broader than the two most prominent men involved jakob ammann is known because of his prominent involvement in a schism among the swiss brethren that began in 1693 of the nearly 200 surnames among the amish in the 1690s , only a very few were found in the reist side , indicating that the two sides formed mostly around two groups of people with different origins however , official sharing of ministry and communion is rare among the most conservative groups of old order amish and mennonites the civil authorities tended to be more lenient in the new locations , and in some cases welcomed the newcomers as they were looking for people to develop their lands
