sanhedrin 96b in yad harav herzog manuscript ( text : מבני בניו שלסיסרא לימדו תורה בירושלם ומנו ר ' עקיבה ) but not other manuscripts ; nissim gaon , commentary to brachot 27b , quoting sanhedrin 96b ; maimonides , commentary to the mishna , introduction ; yalkut reuveni , vayeshev when akiva married the daughter of ben kalba sabua , a wealthy citizen of jerusalem , akiva was an uneducated shepherd in ben kalba sabua 's employ the fact that eliezer was his first teacher , and the only one whom akiva later designates as '' rabbi '' , is of importance in settling the date of akiva 's birth rabbi tarfon was considered as one of akiva 's masters , babylonian talmud ketubot 84b but the pupil outranked his teacher and he became one of akiva 's greatest admirers according to another source , talmud , avodah zara 20a akiva saw that at some future time he would take in marriage the wife of turnus rufus ( his executioner , also known as quintus tineius rufus ) after she converted to judaism , for which reason he spat on the ground ( for having come from a fetid drop ) , smiled ( at her conversion ) and wept ( at such beauty eventually rotting in the dust after death ) the greatest tannaim of the middle of the second century came from akiva 's school , notably rabbi meir , judah bar ilai , simeon bar yochai , jose ben halafta , eleazar ben shammai , and rabbi nehemiah convinced of the necessity of a central authority for judaism , akiva became a devoted adherent and friend of rabban gamaliel , who aimed at constituting the patriarch the true spiritual chief of the jews rosh hashanah 2:9 however , akiva was just as firmly convinced that the power of the patriarch must be limited both by the written and the oral law , the interpretation of which lay in the hands of the learned ; and he was accordingly brave enough to act in ritual matters in rabban gamaliel 's own house contrary to the decisions of rabban gamaliel himself the only established fact concerning akiva 's connection with bar kochba is that he regarded bar kochba as the promised messiah ; yerushalmi ta'anit , 4 68d ; also sanhedrin 93b in yad harav herzog manuscript this is the only evidence of active participation by akiva in the revolution akiva 's death occurred after several years of imprisonment , sanhedrin 12a which places it at about 132 , before the suppression of the bar kochba revolution ; otherwise the delay of the romans in executing him would be quite inexplicable when turnus rufus , as he is called in jewish sources , ordered akiva 's execution , akiva is said to have recited his prayers calmly , though suffering agonies ; and when rufus asked him whether he was a sorcerer , since he felt no pain , akiva replied , '' i am no sorcerer ; but i rejoice at the opportunity now given to me to love my god 'with all my life , ' seeing that i have hitherto been able to love him only 'with all my means ' and 'with all my might , ' '' and began reciting the shema , with the word '' g-d is one ! '' he expired talmud yerushalmi berachot 9 14b , and somewhat modified in babylonian talmud 61b the version in the babylonian talmud tells it as a response of akiva to his students , who asked him how he could yet offer prayers to god and i said to myself , when will i ever be able to fulfill this command ? and now that i am finally able to fulfill it , i should not ? '' then he said the shema , he extended the final word echad ( '' one '' ) until his life expired with that word annually , on the night of lag baomer , boston chassidim and local residents gather at the tomb of rebbe akiva to light a bonfire , a tradition reinstated by the bostoner rebbe in 1983 akiva 's opinion about the creation of man is recorded in pirkei avot : : how favored is man , for he was created after an image ; as scripture says , '' for in an image , god made man '' pirkei avot 3:14 akiva 's anthropology is based upon the principle that man was created בצלם , that is , not in the image of god—which would be בצלם אלהים—but after an image , after a primordial type ; or , philosophically speaking , after an idea—what philo calls in agreement with judean theology , '' the first heavenly man '' ( see adam ḳadmon ) strict monotheist that akiva was , he protested against any comparison of god with the angels , and declared the plain interpretation of כאחד ממנו genesis 3:22 as meaning '' like one of us '' to be arrant blasphemy mekhilta of rabbi ishmael , beshallaḥ 6 it is quite instructive to read how a christian of akiva 's generation , justin martyr , calls the literal interpretation—thus objected to by akiva—a '' jewish heretical one '' 62 in his earnest endeavors to insist as strongly as possible upon the incomparable nature of god , akiva indeed lowers the angels somewhat to the realms of mortals , and ( alluding to psalms 78:25 ) maintains that manna is the actual food of the angels yoma , 75b this view of akiva 's , in spite of the energetic protests of his colleague rabbi ishmael , became the one generally accepted by his contemporaries , 57 , indicates from his views as to the relation between god and man , he deduces that a murderer is to be considered as committing the crime against the divine archetype ( דמות ) of man '' leviticus 19:18 ; sifra , ḳedoshim , 4 he does not , indeed , maintain thereby that the execution of this command is equivalent to the performance of the whole law ; and in one of his polemic interpretations of scripture he protests strongly against a contrary opinion allegedly held by christians , and other non-jews since the diaspora , according to which judaism is at best '' simply morality but he is far from representing strict justice as the only attribute of god : in agreement with the ancient israel theology of the מדת הדין , '' the attribute of justice '' , and מדת הרחמים , '' the attribute of mercy , '' genesis rabbah 12 , end ; the χαριστική and κολαστική of philo , quis rer cited in as to the question concerning the frequent sufferings of the pious and the prosperity of the wicked—truly a burning one in akiva 's time—this is answered by the explanation that the pious are punished in this life for their few sins , in order that in the next they may receive only reward ; while the wicked obtain in this world all the recompense for the little good they have done , and in the next world will receive only punishment for their misdeeds '' no mercy in civil justice ! '' is his basic principle in the doctrine concerning law , mishna ketubot 9:3 and he does not conceal his opinion that the action of the jews in taking the spoil of the egyptians is to be condemned 49a , and חיצונים according to its aramaic equivalent ברייתא ; so that akiva 's utterance reads , '' he who reads aloud in the synagogue from books not belonging to the canon as if they were canonical , '' etc dor , 2:97 aquila , meanwhile , was a disciple of akiva and , under akiva 's guidance , gave the greek-speaking jews a rabbinical bible 1 59a akiva probably also provided for a revised text of the targums ; certainly , for the essential base of the targum onkelos , which in matters of halakah reflects akiva 's opinions completely the condition of the halakah , that is , of religious praxis , and indeed of judaism in general , was a very precarious one at the turn of the 1st century of the common era according to a tradition ( which has historical confirmation ) , it was akiva who systematized and arranged the '' mishna '' ( the halakhic codex ) ; the '' midrash '' ( the exegesis of the halachah ) , and the '' halachot '' ( the logical amplification of the halachah ) the δευτερώσεις τοῦ καλουμένου ραββὶ ακιβά ( mishnah of the one called '' rabbi akiva '' ) mentioned by epiphanius , panarion , 33:9 , and 15 , end as well as the '' great mishnayot of akiva '' , in the midr at the same time , it is fair to consider the mishnah of judah ha-nasi ( called simply '' the mishnah '' ) , as well as the majority of all halakhic midrashim now extant , as derived from the school of akiva mishnah ) ; ( 2 ) the tosefta , which in its original form contains a concise logical argument for the mishnah , somewhat like the lebush of mordecai jafe on the shulchan aruch ; ( 3 ) the halakhic midrash the following halakhic midrashim originating in akiva 's school : the mekhilta of rabbi shimon on exodus ; sifra on leviticus ; sifre zuṭṭa on numbers ; excerpts in yalkut shimoni , and a manuscript in midrash ha-gadol edited for the first time by b the enormous difference between the halakha before and after akiva may be briefly described as follows : the old halakha was ( as its name indicates ) the religious practice sanctioned as binding by tradition , to which were added extensions and ( in some cases ) limitations of the torah , arrived at by strict logical deduction the opposition offered by the sadducees ( which became especially strenuous in the first century bc ) led to the development the halakhic midrash , whose purpose was to deduce these amplifications of the law , by tradition and logic , out of the law itself buber , 39b akiva made the accumulated treasure of the oral law—which until his time was only a subject of knowledge , and not a science—an inexhaustible mine from which , by the means he provided , new treasures might be continually extracted if the older halakha is to be considered as the product of the internal struggle between phariseeism and sadduceeism , the halacha of akiva must be conceived as the result of an external contest between judaism on the one hand and hellenism and hellenistic christianity on the other mention has already been made of the fact that akiva was the creator of a rabbinical bible version elaborated with the aid of his pupil , aquila ( though this is traditionally debated ) , and designed to become the common property of all jews the example of his colleagues and friends , elisha ben abuyah , ben azzai , and ben zoma strengthened him still more in his conviction of the necessity of providing some counterpoise to the intellectual influence of the non-jewish world akiva sought to apply the system of isolation followed by the pharisees ( פרושים those who '' separate '' themselves ) to doctrine as they did to practice , to the intellectual life as they did to that of daily discourse , and he succeeded in furnishing a firm foundation for his system 4:427 he thus gave the jewish mind not only a new field for its own employment , but , convinced both of the immutability of tanakh and of the necessity for development in judaism , he succeeded in reconciling these two apparently hopeless opposites by means of his remarkable method sifra , meẓora , end ; shabbat 64b the biblical legislation in exodus 21:7 could not be reconciled by akiva with his view of jewish ethics : for him a '' jewish slave '' is a contradiction in terms , for every jew is to be regarded as a prince bava metzia 113b akiva therefore teaches , in opposition to the old halakhah , that the sale of a daughter under age by her father conveys to her purchaser no legal title to marriage with her , but , on the contrary , carries with it the duty to keep the female slave until she is of age , and then to marry her love for the holy land , which he as a genuine nationalist frequently and warmly expressed , avot of rabbi natan 26 was so powerful with him that he would have exempted agriculture from much of the rigor of the law upon his inquiry as to what these might be for , he received the answer , '' there will come a man , named akiva ben yosef , who will deduce halakhot from every little curve and crown of the letters of the law however , moses ' spirit was revived when a student asked akiva the source of a law , and akiva replied '' a law to moses at sinai '' tinnius rufus asked : '' which is the more beautiful—god 's work or man 's ? '' akiva replied : '' undoubtedly man 's work is the better , for while nature at god 's command supplies us only with the raw material , human skill enables us to elaborate the same according to the requirements of art and good taste he then put the question , '' why has god not made man just as he wanted him to be ? '' akiva had an answer ready : '' for the very reason , the duty of man is to perfect himself likely the older of the two goes as follows : '' akiva , noticing a stone at a well that had been hollowed out by drippings from the buckets , said : if these drippings can , by continuous action , penetrate this solid stone , how much more can the persistent word of god penetrate the pliant , fleshly human heart , if that word but be presented with patient insistency akiva ascertained that the royal chamber was adorned with white marble statuary , and , based on the theory that a child is similar in nature to whatever its parents gazed upon while conceiving the child , he exonerated the queen from suspicion numbers rabbah 9:34 it is related that , during his stay in rome , akiva became intimately acquainted with the jewish proselyte ketia bar shalom , a very influential roman ( according to some scholars identical with flavius clemens , domitian 's nephew keti ’ a bar shalom ) , who , before his execution for pleading the cause of the jews , bequeathed to akiva all his possessions it was cast upon the shore close to the house of akiva 's creditor , so that when the matrona went to the shore to demand of the sea the amount she had lent akiva , the ebbing tide left boundless riches at her feet without a murmur he resigned himself to this hardship ; and even when a lion devoured his donkey , and a cat killed the rooster whose crowing was to herald the dawn to him , and the wind extinguished his candle , the only remark he made was , '' all that god does is for the good akiva , however , was not to be turned from his purpose ; he sought the son of the tax-gatherer and labored long and assiduously in teaching him the word of god after fasting 40 days and praying to god to bless his efforts , he heard a heavenly voice ( bat kol ) asking , '' why do you go to so much trouble on behalf of this person ? '' '' because he is just the kind to work for , '' was the prompt answer akiva persevered until his pupil was able to officiate as reader in the synagogue ; and when there for the first time he recited the prayer , '' bless the lord ! '' the father suddenly appeared to akiva and overwhelmed him with thanks for his deliverance from the pains of hell through the merit of his son
