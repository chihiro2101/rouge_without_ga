the semiconductor division , situated in mountain view and palo alto , california , was actually managed by executives from syosset , new york , who visited the california sites once a year , even though the semiconductor division earned most of the profits of the company in 1997 , the reconstituted fairchild semiconductor was reborn as an independent company , based in south portland , maine with kirk pond as ceo in 1960 , fairchild built a circuit with four transistors on a single wafer of silicon , thereby creating the first silicon integrated circuit ( texas instruments ' jack kilby had developed an integrated circuit made of germanium on september 12 , 1958 , and was awarded a u.s on september 6 , 2001 , fairchild semiconductor announced the acquisition of impala linear corporation , based in san jose , california , for approximately 6 million in stock and cash fairchild mos division was slow in understanding the potential of the sgt which promised not only faster , more reliable , and denser circuits , but also new device types that could enlarge the field of solid state electronics & nbsp ; – for example , ccds for image sensors , dynamic rams , and non-volatile memory devices such as eprom and flash memories on march 11 , 1997 , national semiconductor corporation announced the us 550 million sale of a reconstituted fairchild to the management of fairchild with the backing of sterling llc , a unit of citicorp venture capital in the fall of 2016 , the fairchild 'on ' semiconductor international closed the west jordan , utah , manufacturing plant fairchild 's south portland , maine and mountaintop , pennsylvania locations are the longest continuously operating semiconductor manufacturing facilities in the world , both operating since 1960 by 1965 , fairchild 's process improvements had brought low-cost manufacturing to the semiconductor industry & nbsp ; – making fairchild nearly the only profitable semiconductor manufacturer in the united states robert noyce and gordon moore were among the last of the original founders to leave , at which point the brain-drain of talents that had fueled the growth of the company was complete in 1956 , william shockley opened shockley semiconductor laboratory as a division of beckman instruments in mountain view , california ; his plan was to develop a new type of '' 4-layer diode '' that would work faster and have more uses than then-current transistors while the fairchild corporation claims the diné women were chosen to work in the shiprock plant due to their '' 'nimble fingers ' '' as previously noted , the women of the shiprock reservation were actually chosen as the workforce due to a lack of labor rights asserted by the women in addition to '' cheap , plentiful workers and tax benefits '' on january 9 , 2004 , fairchild semiconductor ceo kirk pond was appointed as a director of the federal reserve bank of boston , elected by member banks to serve a three-year term in 1979 , fairchild camera and instrument was purchased by schlumberger limited , an oil field services company , for 425 million by the end of the 1970s they had few new products in the pipeline , and increasingly turned to niche markets with their existing product line , notably '' hardened '' integrated circuits for military and space applications and isoplanar ecl products used in exotic applications like cray computers after intel introduced the 8008 8-bit microprocessor , fairchild developed the fairchild f8 8-bit microprocessor , which was according to the cpu museum '' in 1977 the f8 was the world 's leading microprocessor in terms of cpu sales in 1957 the fairchild semiconductor division was started with plans to make silicon transistors at a time when germanium was still the most common material for semiconductor use national semiconductor founding in the fall of 1967 , fairchild suffered a loss for the first time since 1958 and announced write-offs of 4 million due to excess capacity , which contributed to a total loss of 7.6 million in the shiprock dedication commemorative brochure released by the fairchild company , the diné ( navajo ) women circuit makers were celebrated as '' culture workers who produced circuits as part of the 'reproductive ' labor of expressing navajo culture , rather than merely for wages fairchild research developed the clipper architecture , a 32-bit risc-like computer architecture , in the 1980s , resulting in the shipping of the c100 chip in 1986 ) on september 19 , 2016 , on semiconductor and fairchild semiconductor jointly announced that on semiconductor had completed its announced 2.4 billion cash acquisition of fairchild many of the original founders , otherwise known as the '' fairchildren '' , had left fairchild in the 1960s to form companies that grew to prominence in the 1970s , ; page 260 widlar and talbert had earlier left fairchild to join molectro , which was later acquired by national semiconductor noyce advocated the use of silicon as substrate & nbsp ; – since the material costs would consist of sand and a few fine wires , the major cost would be in the manufacturing process looking for funding on their own project , they turned to sherman fairchild 's fairchild camera and instrument , an eastern u.s sales due to fairchild semiconductor division had doubled each year and by the mid-1960s comprised two-thirds of total sales of the parent company on november 18 , 2015 , on semiconductor made an offer to acquire fairchild semiconductor for 2.4 billion ( or 20 per share ) after a few months of speculation that fairchild was seeking a potential buyer the fairchild semiconductor corporation announced november 27 , 1997 that it would acquire the semiconductor division of the raytheon corporation for about 120 million in cash according to sherman fairchild , noyce 's impassioned presentation of his vision was the reason sherman fairchild had agreed to create the semiconductor division for the traitorous eight on september 1 , 2007 , new jersey-based rf semiconductor supplier anadigics acquired fairchild semiconductor 's rf design team , located in tyngsboro , massachusetts , for 2.4 million
