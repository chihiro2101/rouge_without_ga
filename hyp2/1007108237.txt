'' firehouse , may , 1999 kenney reported that floor plans , but not the fire investigation report , showed air-conditioning condenser units near street level on the other side of a non-structural wall from the melody lounge , and that these units had been serviced since the start of the war ( 2000 ) searching for answers to the cocoanut grove fire of 1942 nfpa journal , may/june 2000 in 2012 , the boston police department released the transcripts of witness interviews following the fire , which are posted online witness roland sousa ( volume 2 ) stated that he was initially unconcerned about the fire because , as a regular customer of the melody lounge , he had seen the palm tree decorations ignite before and they were always quickly put out barney welansky , whose connections had allowed the nightclub to operate while in violation of the loose standards of the day , was convicted on nineteen counts of manslaughter ( nineteen victims were randomly selected to represent the dead ) welansky served nearly four years before being quietly pardoned by tobin , who had been elected governor of massachusetts since the fire in the year that followed the fire , massachusetts and other states enacted laws for public establishments banning flammable decorations and inward-swinging exit doors , and requiring exit signs to be visible at all times ( meaning that the exit signs had to have independent sources of electricity , and be easily readable in even the thickest smoke ) the new laws also required that revolving doors used for egress must either be flanked by at least one normal , outward-swinging door , or retrofitted to permit the individual door leaves to fold flat to permit free-flowing traffic in a panic situation , and further required that no emergency exits be chained or bolted shut in such a way as to bar escape through the doors during a panic or emergency situation legend holds that authorities ruled that no boston establishment could be named '' cocoanut grove '' thereafter , but there is no evidence for this ;
