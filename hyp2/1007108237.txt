gangland boss and bootlegger charles '' king '' solomon , also known as '' boston charlie '' , owned the club from 1931 to tuesday , january 24 , 1933 , when he was gunned down in the men 's room of roxbury 's cotton club nightclub ownership passed to solomon 's lawyer barnet '' barney '' welansky , who sought a more mainstream image for the club while he privately boasted of his ties to the mafia and to boston mayor maurice j p.1 coincidentally , on the night of the fire , welansky was still recovering from a heart attack in a private room at massachusetts general hospital ( mgh ) , where some of the victims would be sent the '' grove '' had become one of boston 's most popular nightspots , featuring a restaurant and dancing in the main area , floor shows , and piano-playing entertainers in the melody lounge since the us entry into the war , air-conditioning systems had been serviced and the freon refrigerant was replaced by a flammable gas called methyl chloride , due to the wartime shortage of freon it is estimated that , on that saturday night , more than 1,000 thanksgiving weekend revelers , wartime servicemen and their sweethearts , football fans , and others were crammed into a space rated for a maximum of 460 people unable to see the bulb , he lit a match to illuminate the area , tightened the bulb , and extinguished the match though the lit match had been close to the same fronds where the fire was seen to have begun , the official report determined that tomaszewski 's actions could not be found to be the source of the fire , which '' will be entered into the records of this department as being of unknown origin '' in a final desperate attempt to separate the burning fronds from the fabric-covered false ceiling , the decoration was pulled away from the corner , taking with it a triangular plywood panel at the ceiling level and opening the enclosed space above the false ceiling a fireball burst through the front entryway and spread through the remaining club areas : through the adjacent caricature bar , down a corridor to the broadway lounge , and across the central restaurant and dance floor as the orchestra was beginning its evening show later , after fire laws had tightened , it would become illegal to have only one revolving door as a main entrance without being flanked by outward opening doors with panic bar openers attached , or have the revolving doors set up so that the doors could fold against themselves in emergency situations those in the employ of the establishment fared better in escaping than customers , owing to their familiarity with service areas , where the fire 's effects were less severe than in the public areas , and which provided access to additional window and door exits although several members of the band , including musical director bernie fazioli , lost their lives , most of them escaped backstage and through a service door that they rammed open that statement has been interpreted literally , with the additional color of lesberg using his bass to create a new opening in a wall , and in the context of the vernacular use of the term '' made '' , which can mean attained or achieved an official report revealed that the cocoanut grove had been inspected by a captain in the boston fire department just ten days before the fire and declared safe its report reached no conclusion as to the initial cause of ignition , but attributed the rapid , gaseous spread of the fire to a buildup of carbon monoxide gas due to oxygen-deprived combustion in the enclosed space above the false ceiling of the melody lounge the gas exuded from enclosed spaces as its temperature rose and ignited rapidly as it mixed with oxygen above the entryway , up the stairway to the main floor and along ceilings the fire accelerated as the stairway created a thermal draft , and the high-temperature gas fire ignited pyroxylene ( leatherette ) wall and ceiling covering in the foyer , which in turn exuded flammable gas during the 1990s , former boston firefighter and researcher charles kenney discovered that a highly flammable gas refrigerant , methyl chloride , had been used as a substitute for freon , which was in short wartime supply kenney , charles , '' did a '' mystery gas '' fuel the cocoanut grove fire ? '' firehouse , may , 1999 kenney reported that floor plans , but not the fire investigation report , showed air-conditioning condenser units near street level on the other side of a non-structural wall from the melody lounge , and that these units had been serviced since the start of the war ( 2000 ) searching for answers to the cocoanut grove fire of 1942 nfpa journal , may/june 2000 in 2012 , the boston police department released the transcripts of witness interviews following the fire , which are posted online witness roland sousa ( volume 2 ) stated that he was initially unconcerned about the fire because , as a regular customer of the melody lounge , he had seen the palm tree decorations ignite before and they were always quickly put out barney welansky , whose connections had allowed the nightclub to operate while in violation of the loose standards of the day , was convicted on nineteen counts of manslaughter ( nineteen victims were randomly selected to represent the dead ) welansky served nearly four years before being quietly pardoned by tobin , who had been elected governor of massachusetts since the fire in the year that followed the fire , massachusetts and other states enacted laws for public establishments banning flammable decorations and inward-swinging exit doors , and requiring exit signs to be visible at all times ( meaning that the exit signs had to have independent sources of electricity , and be easily readable in even the thickest smoke ) the new laws also required that revolving doors used for egress must either be flanked by at least one normal , outward-swinging door , or retrofitted to permit the individual door leaves to fold flat to permit free-flowing traffic in a panic situation , and further required that no emergency exits be chained or bolted shut in such a way as to bar escape through the doors during a panic or emergency situation legend holds that authorities ruled that no boston establishment could be named '' cocoanut grove '' thereafter , but there is no evidence for this ;
