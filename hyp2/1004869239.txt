strong spectral lines in the visible part of the spectrum often have a unique fraunhofer line designation , such as k for a line at 393.366 & nbsp ; nm emerging from singly-ionized ca + , though some of the fraunhofer '' lines '' are blends of multiple lines from several different species image : simple spectroscope.jpg thumb 300px right continuous spectrum of an incandescent lamp ( mid ) and discrete spectrum lines of a fluorescent lamp ( bottom ) spectral lines are the result of interaction between a quantum system ( usually atoms , but sometimes molecules or atomic nuclei ) and a single photon the intensity of light , over a narrow frequency range , is reduced due to absorption by the material and re-emission in random directions ) , the frequency of the involved photons will vary widely , and lines can be observed across the electromagnetic spectrum , from radio waves to gamma rays pressure broadening may also be classified by the nature of the perturbing force as follows : linear stark broadening occurs via the linear stark effect , which results from the interaction of an emitter with an electric field of a charged particle at a distance r , causing a shift in energy that is linear in the field strength since the spectral line is a combination of all of the emitted radiation , the higher the temperature of the gas , the broader the spectral line emitted from that gas spectral lines are highly atom-specific , and can be used to identify the chemical composition of any medium capable of letting light pass through it then it will be spontaneously re-emitted , either in the same frequency as the original or in a cascade , where the sum of the energies of the photons emitted will be equal to the energy of the one absorbed ( assuming the system returns to its original state ) the intensity of light , over a narrow frequency range , is increased due to emission by the material spectral lines also depend on the physical conditions of the gas , so they are widely used to determine the chemical composition of stars and other celestial bodies that can not be analyzed by other means , as well as their physical conditions by contrast , a bright emission line is produced when photons from a hot material are detected in the presence of a broad spectrum from a cold source indeed , the reabsorption near the line center may be so great as to cause a self reversal in which the intensity at the center of the line is less than in the wings without qualification , '' spectral lines '' generally implies that one is talking about lines with wavelengths which fall into the range of the visible spectrum if different parts of the emitting body have different velocities ( along the line of sight ) , the resulting line will be broadened , with the line width proportional to the width of the velocity distribution ( \delta e \sim 1/r^3 ) quadratic stark broadening occurs via the quadratic stark effect , which results from the interaction of an emitter with an electric field , causing a shift in energy that is quadratic in the field strength for example , the collisional effects and the motional doppler shifts can act in a coherent manner , resulting under some conditions even in a collisional narrowing , known as the dicke effect therefore , as intensity rises , absorption in the wings rises faster than absorption in the center , leading to a broadening of the profile there are two limiting cases by which this occurs : impact pressure broadening or collisional broadening : the collision of other particles with the light emitting particle interrupts the emission process , and by shortening the characteristic time for the process , increases the uncertainty in the energy emitted ( as occurs in natural broadening ) other frequencies have atomic spectral lines as well , such as the lyman series , which falls in the ultraviolet range .
