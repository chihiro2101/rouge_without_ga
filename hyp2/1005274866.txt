it occurs in mountainous regions in the pyrenees , the alps , the arabian peninsula , the caucasus region , the zagros mountains , the alborz , the koh-i-baba in bamyan , afghanistan , the altai mountains , the himalayas , ladakh in northern india , western and central china in africa , it is found in the atlas mountains , the ethiopian highlands and south from sudan to northeastern democratic republic of the congo , central kenya and northern tanzania they are typically found around or above the tree line which are often near the tops of the mountains , at up to in europe , in africa and in central asia the total population of bearded vultures in southern africa is calculated as being 408 adult birds and 224 young birds of all age classes therefore giving an estimate of about 632 birds a series of sightings took place in 2020 , when an individual bird was sighted separately over the channel island of alderney after migrating north through france , then in the peak district , derbyshire , cambridgeshire and lincolnshire the bird , nicknamed 'vigo ' by tim birch of the derbyshire wildlife trust , is believed to have originated from the reintroduced population in the alps it is essentially unmistakable with other vultures or indeed other birds in flight due to its long , narrow wings , with the wing chord measuring , and long , wedge-shaped tail , which measures in length file : novitateszoologicae18 532 gypaetus barbatus nestling.png nestlings are covered in dark down feathers file : gypaetus-barbatus-bearded-vulture-0b.jpg the juvenile bird is mostly dark file : bartgeier 0505262.jpg the adult has a buff-yellow body and head file : lammergeier or bearded vulture , gypaetus barbatus a skeleton left on a mountain will dehydrate and become protected from bacterial degradation , and the bearded vulture can return to consume the remainder of a carcass even months after the soft parts have been consumed by other animals , larvae and bacteria the bearded vulture diet comprises mammals ( 93 % ) , birds ( 6 % ) and reptiles ( 1 % ) , with medium-sized ungulates forming a large part of the diet these animals have been killed by being surprised by the large birds and battered with wings until they fall off precipitous rocky edges to their deaths ; although in some cases these may be accidental killings when both the vulture and the mammal surprise each other this is unconfirmed , however , and if it does happen , most biologists who have studied the birds generally agree it would be accidental on the part of the vulture occasionally smaller ground-dwelling birds , such as partridges and pigeons , have been reported eaten , possibly either as fresh carrion ( which is usually ignored by these birds ) or killed with beating wings by the vulture the breeding period is variable , being december through september in eurasia , november to june in the indian subcontinent , october to may in ethiopia , throughout the year in eastern africa and may to january in southern africa the growing availability of firearms , combined with bounties offered for dead vultures , caused a sharp decline in the bearded vulture population around the alps zoologists paul geroudet and gilbert amigues attempted to release vultures that had been captured in afghanistan , but this approach proved unsuccessful : it was too difficult to capture the vultures in the first place , and too many died in transport on their way to france a second attempt was made in 1987 , using a technique called '' hacking , '' by which young individuals ( from 90 to 100 days ) from zoological parks would be taken from the nest and placed in a protected area in the alps this method has proven more successful , with over 200 birds released in the alps from 1987 to 2015 , and a bearded vulture population has reestablished itself in the alps it was largely wiped out in europe , and by the beginning of the 20th century the only substantial population was in the spanish and french pyrenees the increase of infrastructure includes the building of houses , roads and power lines and a major issue with infrastructure and bird species populations is the collision with power lines the declines of the bearded vulture populations have been documented throughout their range resulting from a decrease in habitat space , fatal collisions with energy infrastructure , reduced food availability , poisons left out for carnivores and direct persecution in the form of trophy hunting this species is currently listed as near threatened by the iucn red list last accessed on 1 october 2016 , the population continues to decline as the distribution ranges of this species continues to decline due to human development actions that have been implemented include the mitigation of existing and proposed energy structures to prevent collision risks , the improved management of supplementary feeding sites as well to reduce the populations from being exposed to human persecution and poisoning accidents and to also have outreach programmes that are aimed as reducing poisoning incidents the habit of eating bones and apparently not killing living animals was noted by sa'di in gulistan , written in 1258 , and emperor jahangir had a bird 's crop examined in 1625 to find that it was filled with bones the greek playwright aeschylus was said to have been killed in 456 or 455 bc by a tortoise dropped by an eagle who mistook his bald head for a stone â€“ if this incident did occur , the bearded vulture is a likely candidate for the '' eagle '' in the bible/torah , the bearded vulture , as the ossifrage , is among the birds forbidden to be eaten ( leviticus 11:13 ) more recently , in 1944 , shimon peres ( called shimon persky at the time ) and david ben-gurion found a nest of bearded vultures in the negev desert video of lammergeier shattering bones into smaller pieces on which it then feeds at arkive species text in the atlas of southern african birds facts and characteristics : bearded vulture at vulture territory the lammergeier in spain cine and photo work about the bearded vulture in the alps diet information bone-eating vulture and a snow wolf
