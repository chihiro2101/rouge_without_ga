the camera system had a narrow-angle lens ( 700 & nbsp ; mm ) and a wide-angle lens ( 140 & nbsp ; mm ) , with a 2048×2048 pixel ccd chip the radio antenna along with the rest of the instrument was built by nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory with international contributions by the max planck institute for solar system research ( mps ) , among others rosetta and philae also searched for organic molecules , nucleic acids ( the building blocks of dna and rna ) and amino acids ( the building blocks of proteins ) by sampling and analysing the comet 's nucleus and coma cloud of gas and dust , helping assess the contribution comets made to the abiogenesis on earth ; amino acids upon landing on the comet , philae should have also tested some hypotheses as to why essential amino acids are almost all '' left-handed '' , which refers to how the atoms arrange in orientation in relation to the carbon core of the molecule measurements by the cosac and ptolemy instruments on the philae lander revealed sixteen organic compounds , four of which were seen for the first time on a comet , including acetamide , acetone , methyl isocyanate and propionaldehyde together with observations by hubble space telescope it could be confirmed that p/2010 & nbsp ; a2 is not a comet , but an asteroid , and that the tail most likely consists of particles from an impact by a smaller asteroid at the time of the first deceleration burn rosetta was approximately away from 67p and had a relative velocity of + ; by the end of the last burn , which occurred on 23 july , the distance had been reduced to just over with a relative velocity of + in total eight burns were used to align the trajectories of rosetta 67p with the majority of the deceleration occurring during three burns : delta-v of on 21 may , on 4 june , and on 18 june 4 september – the first science data from rosetta alice instrument was reported , showing that the comet is unusually dark in ultraviolet wavelengths , hydrogen and oxygen are present in the coma , and no significant areas of water-ice have been found on the comet 's surface as part of the european space agency 's media campaign in support of the rosetta mission , both the rosetta and philae spacecraft were given anthropomorphic personalities in an animated web series titled once upon a time the series depicts various stages in the rosetta mission , involving the personified rosetta and philae on '' a classic road trip story into the depths of our universe '' , complemented with various visual gags presented in an educational context after the success of the series , however , the esa commissioned the studio to continue producing new episodes in the series throughout the course of the mission a total of twelve videos in the series were produced from 2013 to 2016 , with a 25-minute compilation of the series released in december 2016 , after the end of the mission in 2019 , design & data adapted the series into a 26-minute planetarium show that was commissioned by the swiss museum of transport , and solicited to eighteen planetariums across europe , with an aim '' to inspire the young generation to explore the universe , designed by esa employee and cartoonist carlo palazzari , became a central part of public image of the rosetta mission , appearing in promotional material for the mission such as posters and merchandise , and often credited as a major factor in the popularity of the mission among the public the script for each episode of the series is written by science communicators at the european space research and technology centre , who kept close with mission operators and the producers at design & data canonically , rosetta and philae are depicted as siblings , with rosetta being the older sister , inspired by the spacecraft 's feminine name , of philae , her younger brother to promote the spacecraft 's arrival at comet 67p/churyumov–gerasimenko and the landing of philae in 2014 , a short film was produced by the european space agency with polish visual effects production company platige image titled ambition , the film , shot in iceland , stars irish actor aidan gillen , known for his roles in game of thrones and the wire , and irish actress aisling franciosi , also of game of thrones fame , and was directed by oscar-nominated polish director tomasz bagiński set in the far future , ambition centers around a discussion between a master , played by gillen , discussing the importance of ambition with his apprentice , played by franciosi , using the rosetta mission as an example of such british science fiction author and former esa employee alastair reynolds spoke about the film 's message at the premiere , stating to the audience that '' our distant descendants may look back to rosetta with the same sense of admiration that we reserve for , say , columbus or magellan '' the film 's conception was the result of the bfi 's inquiry to the esa for a contribution to their celebration of science fiction , with the esa taking the opportunity to promote the rosetta mission through the festival tim reyes of universe today complimented the titular theme of ambition in the film , stating that it '' shows us the forces at work in and around esa '' , and that the it '' might accomplish more in 7 minutes than gravity did in 90 '' ryan wallace of ibt media also gave praise to the film , writing , '' whether you 're a sci-fi fanatic , or simply an interested humble astronomer , the short clip will undoubtedly give you a new view of our solar system , and the research out there in space today the entire mission was featured heavily in social media , with a facebook account for the mission and both the satellite and the lander having an official twitter account portraying a personification of both spacecraft on 23 september 2016 , vangelis released the studio album rosetta in honour of the mission , which was used on 30 september in the '' rosetta 's final hour '' streaming video of the esa livestream event '' rosetta grand finale ''
