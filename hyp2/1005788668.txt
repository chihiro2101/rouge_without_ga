wilson described six types of transform faults : growing length : in situations where a transform fault links a spreading center and the upper block of a subduction zone or where two upper blocks of subduction zones are linked , the transform fault itself will grow in length instead of the ridges moving away from each other , as they do in other strike-slip faults , transform-fault ridges remain in the same , fixed locations , and the new ocean seafloor created at the ridges is pushed away from the ridge both types of fault are strike-slip or side-to-side in movement ; nevertheless , transform faults always end at a junction with another plate boundary , while transcurrent faults may die out without a junction with another fault the san andreas fault links the east pacific rise off the west coast of mexico ( gulf of california ) to the mendocino triple junction ( part of the juan de fuca plate ) off the coast of the northwestern united states , making it a ridge-to-transform-style fault a paper written by geophysicist taras gerya theorizes that the creation of the transform faults between the ridges of the mid-oceanic ridge is attributed to rotated and stretched sections of the mid-oceanic ridge the opposite occurs when a ridge linked to a subducting plate , where all the lithosphere ( new seafloor ) being created by the ridge is subducted , or swallowed up , by the subduction zone the majority of the syncline is found in southland and the catlins in the island 's southeast , but a smaller section is also present in the tasman district in the island 's northwest in his work on transform-fault systems , geologist tuzo wilson said that transform faults must be connected to other faults or tectonic-plate boundaries on both ends ; because of that requirement , transform faults can grow in length , keep a constant length , or decrease in length faults in general are focused areas of deformation or strain , which are the response of built-up stresses in the form of compression , tension , or shear stress in rock at the surface or deep in the earth 's subsurface geophysicist and geologist john tuzo wilson recognized that the offsets of oceanic ridges by faults do not follow the classical pattern of an offset fence or geological marker in reid 's elastic-rebound theory , reid , h.f slip along transform faults does not increase the distance between the ridges it separates ; the distance remains constant in earthquakes because the ridges are spreading centers although separated only by tens of kilometers , this separation between segments of the ridges causes portions of the seafloor to push past each other in opposing directions
