unger ( 1964 ) ch 8 the act had the immediate effect of depressing silver prices , hurting western mining interests , who labeled the act '' the crime of '73 '' , but its effect was offset somewhat by the introduction of a silver trade dollar for use in asia and the discovery of new silver deposits at virginia city , nevada , that resulted in new investment in mining activity a period of economic overexpansion arose from the northern railroad boom before a series of economic setbacks : the black friday ( 1869 ) , the great chicago fire , an outbreak of equine influenza and the boston fire of 1872 , and the coinage act of 1873 despite this , britain did not experience the scale of financial mayhem seen in america and central europe , perhaps forestalled by an expectation that the liquidity-constraining provisions of the bank charter act of 1844 would be suspended as they had been in the crises of 1847 , 1857 , and 1866 the discovery of large quantities of silver in the united states and several european colonies caused the panic of 1873 and thus a decline in the value of silver relative to gold , devaluing india 's standard currency the decision of the german empire to cease minting silver thaler coins in 1871 caused a drop in demand and downward pressure on the value of silver , which , in turn , affected the us since much of the supply of silver was mined there the opening of the suez canal in 1869 was one of the causes of the panic of 1873 because goods from the far east had been carried in sailing vessels around the cape of good hope and were stored in british warehouses for example , germany dramatically increased investment of social overhead capital , such as in the management of electric power transmission lines , roads , and railroads , thereby stimulating industrial demand in that country , but similar investment stagnated or decreased in britain in the cape colony , the panic caused bankruptcies , rising unemployment , a pause in public works , and a major trade slump that lasted until the discovery of gold in 1886 the act moved the united states to a de facto gold standard , which meant it would no longer buy silver at a statutory price or free silver , but it would still mint silver dollars for export in the form of trade dollars in september 1873 , jay cooke & company , a major component of the country 's banking establishment , found itself unable to market several million dollars in northern pacific railway bonds the resulting difference in capital formation accounts for the divergent levels of industrial production in the two countries and the different growth rates during and after the depression 132–133 however there was heavy unemployment in the basic industries of coal , iron and steel , engineering , and shipbuilding , especially in 1873 , 1886 , and 1893 from 1873 to 1896 , a period sometimes referred to as the long depression , most european countries experienced a drastic fall in prices as sailing vessels were not adaptable for use through the suez canal ( because the prevailing winds of the mediterranean sea blow from west to east ) , the british entrepôt trade suffered during the depression , the british ratio of net national capital formation to net national product fell from 11.5 % to 6.0 % , but the german ratio rose from 10.6 % to 15.9 %
