as early as 1915 , a number of b.e.2c aircraft ( the infamous '' fokker fodder '' ) were modified into the first night fighters after lack of success while using darts and small incendiary bombs to attack zeppelins from above , ultimately a lewis gun loaded with novel incendiary ammunition , was mounted at an angle of 45° to fire upwards , to attack the enemy from below after over a year of night zeppelin raids , on the night of 2–3 september 1916 , a be2c flown by captain leefe robinson downed the sl 11 , the first german airship to be shot down over britain because of airships ' limitations , the luftstreitkräfte began to introduce long-range heavy bombers , starting with the gotha g.iv aircraft that gradually took over the offensive while their early daylight raids in may 1917 were able to easily evade the weak defenses of london , the strengthening of the home defence fighter force led to the germans switching to night raids from 3 september 1917 the camels ' vickers guns were replaced by lewis guns mounted over the wings , as the flash from the vickers tended to dazzle the pilot when they were fired , and synchronised guns were considered unsafe for firing incendiary ammunition to provide suitable equipment for home defence squadrons in the north of the uk , avro 504k trainers were converted to night fighters by removing the front cockpit and mounting a lewis gun on the top wing in the meantime , aircraft performance had improved tremendously ; compared to their first world war counterparts , modern bombers could fly about twice as fast , at over twice the altitude , with much greater bomb loads the widespread conclusion was that '' the bomber will always get through '' , and the royal air force invested almost all of their efforts in developing a night bomber force , with the central flying school responsible for one of the most important developments in the period by introducing '' blind flying '' training the only such system to see any sort of widespread operational use was the spanner anlage system used on the dornier do 17z night fighters of the luftwaffe realizing that radar was a far more practical solution to the problem , robert watson-watt handed the task of developing a radar suitable for aircraft use to 'taffy ' bowen in the mid-1930s this naturally led to the use of light bombers as the preferred platform for airborne radars , and in may 1939 , the first experimental flight took place , on a fairey battle these early systems had significant practical problems , and while work was underway to correct these flaw , by the time the blitz opened in august 1940 , the night fighter fleet was still in its infancy through this period , the raf experimented with many other aircraft and interception methods in an effort to get a working night fighter force this coincided with the arrival of the beaufighter , which offered significantly higher performance than the pre-war blenheims ; it was the highest performance aircraft capable of carrying the bulky early airborne interception radars used for night fighter operations , and quickly became invaluable as a night fighter the british also experimented with mounting pilot-operated ai mark 6 radar sets in single-seat fighters , and the hurricane ii c ( nf ) , a dozen of which were produced in 1942 , became the first radar-equipped , single-seat night fighter in the world unlike in britain , where the major targets lay only a few minutes ' flight time from the coast , germany was defence of the reich that gave them long times to deal with intruding bombers instead of airborne radar , they relied on ground-based systems ; the targets would first be picked up by radar assigned to a '' cell '' , the radar would then direct a searchlight to '' paint '' the target , allowing the fighters to attack them without on-board aids by flying all of the bombers over a cell in a short period , the vast majority of the bombers flew right over them without ever having been plotted , let alone attacked in 1942 , the germans first started deploying the initial b/c low uhf-band version of the lichtenstein radar , and in extremely limited numbers , using a 32-dipole element matratze ( mattress ) antenna array this late date , and slow introduction , combined with the capture of a ju 88r-1 night fighter equipped with it in april 1943 when flown to raf dyce , scotland , by a defecting luftwaffe crew , allowed british radio engineers to develop jamming equipment to counter it the low vhf-band sn-2 unit that replaced the c-1 remained relatively secure until july 1944 , but only at the cost of using huge , eight-dipole element hirschgeweih ( stag 's antlers ) antennae that slowed their fighters as much as 25 & nbsp ; mph , making them easy prey for british night fighters that had turned to the offensive role the capture in july 1944 of a ju 88g-1 night fighter of njg 2 equipped with an sn-2 lichtenstein set , flown by mistake into raf woodbridge , revealed the secrets of the later , longer-wavelength replacement for the earlier b/c and c-1 sets the luftwaffe also used single-engined aircraft in the night-fighter role , starting in 1939 with the arado ar 68 and early messerschmitt bf 109 models , which they later referred to as wilde sau ( wild boar ) in this case , the fighters , typically focke-wulf fw 190s , were equipped only with a direction finder and landing lights to allow them to return to base at night for the fighter to find their targets , other aircraft , which were guided from the ground , would drop strings of flares in front of the bombers messerschmitt bf 109 had g6n and similar models fitted with fug 350 naxos '' z '' radar receivers for homing in on the 3-gigahertz band h2s emissions of raf bombers – the april 1944 combat debut of the american-designed h2x bomb-aiming radar , operating at a higher 10 & nbsp ; ghz frequency for both raf pathfinder mosquitos and usaaf b-24 liberators that premiered their use over europe , deployed a bombing radar that could not be detected by the german naxos equipment the bf 109g series aircraft fitted with the naxos radar detectors also were fitted with the low- to mid-vhf band fug 217/218 neptun active search radars , as were focke-wulf fw 190 a-6/r11 aircraft : these served as radar-equipped night-fighters with njgr 10 and njg 11 ledwoch and skupiewski 1994 the effective schräge musik offensive armament fitment was the german name given to installations of upward-firing autocannon mounted in heavy fighter by the luftwaffe and both the imperial japanese navy air service and imperial japanese army air service during world war ii , with the first victories for the luftwaffe and ijnas each occurring in may 1943 heaton and lewis 2008 at the urging of the british , who were looking to purchase us-made aircraft , us day fighters were initially adapted to a night role , including the douglas p-70 and later lockheed p-38 lightning the only purpose-built night fighter design deployed during the war , the american northrop p-61 black widow was introduced first in europe and then saw action in the pacific , but it was given such a low priority that the british had ample supplies of their own designs by the time it was ready for production to counter these raids , the navy fitted microwave-band , compact radar sets to the wings of its single-engined grumman f6f hellcat and vought f4u corsair fighters by the close of the war , operating them successfully in the pacific both the british and germans spent some effort on the topic , but as the germans were on the defensive , their work was given a much higher priority the messerschmitt me 262 , the first operational jet fighter in the world , was adapted to the role , such as the installation of on-board neptun radar high-vhf band radar and hirschgeweih ( '' stag 's antlers '' ) antennae ; intercepts were generally or entirely made using wilde sau methods , rather than ai radar-controlled interception however , the need for new designs was evident , and some low-level work started in the closing stages of the war , including the us contract for the northrop f-89 scorpion when the soviet plans to build an atomic bomb became known in the west in 1948 , this project was still long from being ready to produce even a prototype , and in march 1949 , they started development of both the north american f-86d sabre and lockheed f-94 starfire as stop-gap measures in the korean war , after the starfire proved to be ineffective against the latest soviet-supplied aircraft , marine corps douglas f3d skyknights shot down six aircraft , including five mikoyan-gurevich mig-15s without loss , as the mig-15s lacked radar to shoot down individual fighters , though they were effective against bomber formations at night a similar conversion of the de havilland vampire was also introduced ; this was originally developed by the company as a private venture and initially ordered by egypt , instead the raf took over the order to serve an interim measure between the retirement of the mosquito night fighter and the meteor night fighter 's introduction both the meteor and vampire conversions were rapidly followed by a more capable night fighter in the form of the de havilland venom , the first model of which having been introduced during 1953 during this transition period , the mcdonnell douglas f-4 phantom ii was offered to the us navy ; at the time , the vought f-8 crusader had already been accepted as a '' day '' dogfighter , while the subsonic mcdonnell f3h demon was the navy 's all-weather fighter . however , compared to early air-superiority designs such as the f-100 or f-8 , the massive phantom , nevertheless , had enough raw power from its twin j79 engines to prove adaptable as the preferred platform for tangling with agile mig-17 and mig-21 fighters over the skies of vietnam , dorr and bishop 1996 , pp
