there is no obvious visible source in the form of a spring , but the river originates in the lakes in the diekenbruch near ankershagen , close to and south-east of the watershed between the north and baltic seas the havel 's main tributary is the spree , which joins the havel in spandau , a western borough of berlin , and is longer and delivers more water than the havel itself above the confluence at the southern end of the ruppiner see , weirs can distribute the waters of the rhin either east- or westwards , rejoining the havel in two places apart along a straight line , and more than apart along the course of the river as the course of the elbe has a higher gradient than the havel , the water level of the havel in havelberg can be kept 1.4 meters below the elbe ( at the junction of the traverse communicating canal , protected by a lock ) whilst its upper reaches carry little other than leisure traffic , further downstream it provides an important link in the german commercial waterway network , carrying traffic from the rhine and the north sea to berlin and poland this canal connects to paretz , on the havel downstream , and was built in the 1950s to allow east german vessels to avoid the stretch of the river under the political control of west berlin during the partition of germany , this formed the border between east germany and west berlin , and border control points were established for vessels navigating the river the stretch of the river between the confluence with the spree at spandau and the junction with the elbe–havel canal at plaue is administered as part of the lower havel–waterway , which also includes the stretch of river downstream to the confluence with the elbe between spandau and plaue , the river forms part of the main inland waterway route from the rhine and the west of germany , and from hamburg and the north sea ports , to both berlin and poland the teltow canal joins the river from the east via the griebnitzsee just before the city reaches the city of potsdam , providing an alternative route to the oder–spree canal avoiding central berlin the havel , here known as the potsdamer havel , takes a route south-west through potsdam and the templiner see to the schwielowsee , then north-west to paretz , whilst the sacrow–paretz canal takes a shorter route due east to paretz , saving some compared to the potsdamer havel leisure craft pass through the centre of the city , using the short brandenburg city canal , a smaller lock , and a stretch of the river whilst the lower reaches of the havel provide the most direct route to hamburg and the north sea ports , variable water levels in the elbe affect those in the lower havel , and together these can restrict navigation
