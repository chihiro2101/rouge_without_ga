this move away from the practice of ijtihād was made by the hanafi and maliki law schools , and the majority of shafiis , but not by hanbalis or a number of prominent shafīʿi jurists who believed that '' true consensus '' ( ijma اجماع ) , apart from that of muhammad 's companions , did not exist '' and that '' the constant continuous existence of mujtahids ( مجتهد ) was a theological requirement these rules allowed mujtahids to issue adjudications on any subject , that could be derived through this process of ijtihad , demonstrating their great responsibility to the shia community furthermore , according to shia islamic jurisprudence a believer of islam is either a mujtahid ( one that expresses their own legal reasoning ) , or a muqallid ( one performing taqlid of a mujtahid ) and a muhtat ( one who acts with precaution ) mujtahid is defined as a muslim scholar that has met certain requirements including a strong knowledge of the qur'an , sunna , and arabic , as well as a deep understanding of legal theory and the precedent ; all of which allows them to be considered fully qualified to practice ijtihad a woman can be a mujtahid and there are dozens who have attained the rank in the modern history of iran ( for instance , amina bint al-majlisi in the safavid era , bibi khanum in the qajar era , lady amin in the pahlavi era , and zohreh sefati during the time of the islamic republic ) glassé , cyril , the concise encyclopaedia of islam , 2nd edition , stacey international , london ( 1991 ) ignaz goldziher ( translated by a and r hamori ) , introduction to islamic

research has disproved the notion that the practice of ijtihad was abandoned in the 10th century — or even later — the extent of legal change during this period and its mechanisms remain a subject of scholarly debate around the beginning of the 10th century , most sunni jurists argued that all major matters of religious law had been settled , allowing for taqlid ( تقليد ) , '' the established legal precedents and traditions , '' to take priority over ijtihād ( اجتهاد ) however , with this introduction of common laws for each madhhab , legal scholars began to dismiss the practice of independent ijtihad and instead maintained the title of mujtahid only for the founders of the four main schools of islamic law ( hanafiyya , malikiyya , shafiyya , hanbaliyya ) therefore , from the 12th century onwards jurists could occupy the position of a mujtahid or access ijtihad in only two cases , when distinguishing between the manifest and the obscure views of their particular schools or when they served as '' imitators '' of mujtahids , expressing the views of the more qualified mujtahids before them not only did shia muslims require : knowledge of the texts of the qur'an and sunnah justice in matters of public and personal life utmost piety understanding of the cases where shia mujtahids reached consensus ability to exercise competence and authority however , these scholars also depended on further training that could be received in religious centers called hawza ijtihad was “ limited to a systematic method of interpreting the law on the basis of authoritative texts , the quran and sunna , ” and the rulings could be “ extended to a new problem as long as the precedent and the new situation shared the same clause at these centers they are taught the important subjects and technical knowledge a mujtahid need be proficient in such as : arabic grammar and literature logic extensive knowledge of the qur'anic sciences and hadith science of narrators principle of jurisprudence comparative jurisprudence therefore , shia mujtahids remain revered throughout the shia islamic world one such ranking placed the founders of maddhabs , who were credited with being '' absolute mujtahids '' ( mujtahid muṭlaq ) capable of methodological innovation , at the top , and jurists capable only of taqlīd at the bottom , with mujtahids and those who combined ijtihād and taqlīd given the middle ranks must be able to confirm the consensus ( ijma ) of the companions , the successors , and the leading imams and mujtahideen of the past , in order to prevent making decisions that disregard these honored decisions made in the past in its technical sense , ijtihad can be defined as a '' process of legal reasoning and hermeneutics through which the jurist-mujtahid derives or rationalizes law on the basis of the qur'an and the sunna '' another , ( made by asghar ali engineer of india ) , is that the adaat ( customs and traditions ) of arabs were used in the development of the sharia , and form an important part of it a knowledgeable person who gives a ruling on the sharī ‘ ah , but is not able to exercise their judgement in the inference of the rulings from the sources , is not called a mujtahid but rather a muqallid it was not until the end of the eighteenth century that the title of mujtahid became associated with the term faqih or one who is an expert in jurisprudence they emphasized the use of ijtihad , but in contrast to its original use , they sought to '' apply contemporary intellectual methods '' such as academic or scientific thought '' to the task of reforming islam '' they are very much not divine or immutable , and have no more legal justification to be part of the sharia than the adaat of muslims living beyond the home of the original muslim in the arab hejaz starting in the middle of the 19th century , islamic modernisms such as sir sayyid ahmed khan , jamal al-din al-afghani , and muhammad abduh emerged seeking to revitalize islam by re-establish and reform sharia and its interpretations to accommodate islam with modern society it was the duty of the educated jurists to come to a ruling that would be in the best interest of the muslim community and promote the public good during the early period , ijtihad referred to the exercise of one 's discretionary opinion ( ra ' y ) on the basis of the knowledge of the precedent ( ‘ ilm )
