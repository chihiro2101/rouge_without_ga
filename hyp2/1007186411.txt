the election took place on 15 september 1189 at pipewell , with the consecration on 22 october 1189 at westminster modern historians have discounted this , as the list also includes benefactors , not just students ; other evidence points to the fact that walter had a poor grasp of latin , and did not consider himself to be a learned man 595 the tomb occupied a highly visible spot in the trinity chapel , and walter was the first archbishop to be buried there since the 1170s , when all of the tombs but becket 's had been relocated to focus attention on becket 's shrine 115 going ahead of the king directly from marseille to the holy land in a group that included baldwin of forde , archbishop of canterbury , and ranulf de glanvill 471 walter subsequently led the english army back to england after richard 's departure from palestine , but in sicily he heard of the king 's capture , and diverted to germany image : gefangennahme.jpg thumb left the capture of king richard i from the chronicle of peter of eboli , 1197 alt illuminated manuscript illustration of a man in armour on horseback being captured by two armoured men on foot. 250px by 1184–1185 walter had a position as a exchequer warren advances the theory that either walter or geoffrey fitz peter , instead of ranulf glanvill , was the author of tractatus of glanvill , a legal treatise on the laws and constitutions of the english 141–142 walter refused to acquiesce in the election of gerald of wales to the see of st david 's in wales and opposed the efforts of gerald and others to elevate st david 's to an archbishopric 8 and soon after walter 's return to england , he was duly elected archbishop of canterbury , having been transferred to the see on 29 may 1193 he promised that the new foundation 's canons would not be allowed to vote in archiepiscopal elections nor would the body of saint thomas becket ever be moved to the new church , but the monks of his cathedral chapter were suspicious and appealed to the papacy 79–80 one of walter 's first acts as justiciar was in february 1194 , when he presided over a feudal judgement of john , richard 's younger brother not only did this reduce forgeries , it led to the establishment of the charter roll , an administrative copy of all charters issued and confirmed by the government 49 walter was also responsible for choosing royal justices , and many of his choices were connected with , or had previously worked with , the archbishop in the royal administration 42–43 the studies of james holt and others have shown that richard was highly involved in government decisions , and that it was more a partnership between the king and his ministers 411 walter actively investigated ecclesiastical misconduct , and deposed several abbots , including robert of thorney abbey in 1195 and an abbot of st mary 's in the province of the archbishop of york this council set forth 14 & nbsp ;
