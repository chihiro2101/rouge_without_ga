for several millennia before the onset of industrialisation , design , technical expertise , and manufacturing were often done by individual craftsmen , who determined the form of a product at the point of its creation , according to their own manual skill , the requirements of their clients , experience accumulated through their own experimentation , and knowledge passed on to them through training or apprenticeship the growth of trade in the medieval period led to the emergence of large workshops in cities such as florence , venice , nuremberg and bruges , where groups of more specialized craftsmen made objects with common forms through the repetitive duplication of models which defined by their shared training and technique competitive pressures in the early 16th century led to the emergence in italy and germany of pattern books : collections of engravings illustrating decorative forms and motifs which could be applied to a wide range of products , and whose creation took place in advance of their application this pattern of large-scale royal patronage was repeated in the court porcelain factories of the early 18th century , such as the meissen porcelain workshops established in 1709 by the grand duke of saxony , where patterns from a range of sources , including court goldsmiths , sculptors and engravers , were used as models for the vessels and figurines for which it became famous as long as reproduction remained craft-based , however , the form and artistic quality of the product remained in the hands of the individual craftsman , and tended to decline as the scale of production increased for instance the deutscher werkbund , founded in 1907 and a precursor to the bauhaus , was a state-sponsored effort to integrate traditional crafts and industrial mass-production techniques , to put germany on a competitive footing with great britain and the united states various schools of industrial design specialize in one of these aspects , ranging from pure art colleges and design schools ( product styling ) , to mixed programs of engineering and design , to related disciplines such as exhibit design and interior design , to schools that almost completely subordinated aesthetic design to concerns of usage and ergonomics , the so-called functionalist school for engineering require accreditation by the accreditation board for engineering and technology ( abet ) in contrast to programs for industrial design which are accredited by the national association of schools of art and design ( nasad ) industrial design , thames & hudson , 1980 , mayall , wh , industrial design for engineers , london : iliffe books , 1967 , mayall , wh , machines and perception in industrial design , london : studio vista , 1968 , meikle , jeffrey
