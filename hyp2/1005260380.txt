while these do not refer to the same thing , general circulation models are typically the tools used for climate model , and hence the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably however , the term '' global climate model '' is ambiguous and may refer to an integrated framework that incorporates multiple components including a general circulation model , or may refer to the general class of climate models that use a variety of means to represent the climate mathematically the first to combine both oceanic and atmospheric processes was developed in the late 1960s at the noaa geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory atmospheric ( agcms ) and oceanic gcms ( ogcms ) can be coupled to form an atmosphere-ocean coupled general circulation model ( cgcm or aogcm ) with the addition of submodels such as a sea ice model or a model for evapotranspiration over land , aogcms become the basis for a full climate model examples are programs that solve the primitive equations , given energy input and energy dissipation in the form of scale-dependent friction , so that atmospheric waves with the highest wavenumbers are most attenuated atmospheric gcms ( agcms ) model the atmosphere ( and typically contain a land-surface model as well ) using imposed sea surface temperatures ( ssts ) agcms consist of a dynamical core which integrates the equations of fluid motion , typically for : surface pressure horizontal components of velocity in layers temperature and water vapor in layers radiation , split into solar/short wave and terrestrial/infrared/long wave parameters for : convection land surface processes albedo hydrology cloud cover a gcm contains prognostic equations that are a function of time ( typically winds , temperature , moisture , and surface pressure ) together with diagnostic equations that are evaluated from them for a specific time period as an example , pressure at any height can be diagnosed by applying the hydrostatic equation to the predicted surface pressure and the predicted values of temperature between the surface and the height of interest ogcms model the ocean ( with fluxes from the atmosphere imposed ) and may contain a sea ice model these models are the basis for model predictions of future climate , such as are discussed by the ipcc hadgem1 ( and other ocean models ) use an ocean grid with higher resolution in the tropics to help resolve processes believed to be important for the el niño ( enso ) typical agcm resolutions are between 1 and 5 degrees in latitude or longitude : hadcm3 , for example , uses 3.75 in longitude and 2.5 degrees in latitude , giving a grid of 96 by 73 points ( 96 x 72 for some variables ) ; and has 19 vertical levels akio arakawa did much of the early work , and variants of his scheme are still used , although a variety of different schemes are now in use these can be idealised scenarios ( most commonly , co 2 emissions increasing at 1 % /yr ) or based on recent history ( usually the '' is92a '' or more recently the sres scenarios ) for the 7 climate models shown there , the temperature change to 2100 varies from 2 to 4.5 & nbsp ; °c with a median of about 3 & nbsp ; °c these effects are believed to be small in comparison to greenhouse gas ( ghg ) forcing in the long term , but large volcanic eruptions , for example , can exert a substantial temporary cooling effect for the six sres marker scenarios , ipcc ( 2007:7–8 ) gave a '' best estimate '' of global mean temperature increase ( 2090–2099 relative to the period 1980–1999 ) of 1.8 & nbsp ; °c to 4.0 & nbsp ; °c over the same time period , the '' likely '' range ( greater than 66 % probability , based on expert judgement ) for these scenarios was for a global mean temperature increase of 1.1 to 6.4 & nbsp ; °c in 2000 , a comparison between measurements and dozens of gcm simulations of enso-driven tropical precipitation , water vapor , temperature , and outgoing longwave radiation found similarity between measurements and simulation of most factors for the end of the 21st century ( 2071 to 2100 ) , for sres scenario a2 , the change of global average sat change from aogcms compared with 1961 to 1990 is +3.0 & nbsp ; °c ( 5.4 & nbsp ; °f ) and the range is +1.3 to +4.5 & nbsp ; °c ( +2.3 to 8.1 & nbsp ; °f ) the global climate models used for climate projections are similar in structure to ( and often share computer code with ) numerical weather prediction , but are nonetheless logically distinct since forecasts are typically a few days or a week and sea surface temperatures change relatively slowly , such models do not usually contain an ocean model but rely on imposed ssts often local models are run using global model results for boundary conditions , to achieve higher local resolution : for example , the met office runs a mesoscale model with an resolution covering the uk , and various agencies in the us employ models such as the ngm and nam models climate models use quantitative methods to simulate the interactions of the atmosphere , oceans , land surface and ice all climate models take account of incoming energy as short wave electromagnetic radiation , chiefly visible and short-wave ( near ) infrared , as well as outgoing energy as long wave ( far ) infrared electromagnetic radiation from the earth , climate change 2007 chapter 10 : global climate projections , in ( pb : three ( or more properly , four since time is also considered ) dimensional gcm 's discretise the equations for fluid motion and energy transfer and integrate these over time models range in complexity : a simple radiant heat transfer model treats the earth as a single point and averages outgoing energy this can be expanded vertically ( radiative-convective models ) , or horizontally finally , ( coupled ) atmosphere–ocean–sea ice global climate models discretise and solve the full equations for mass and energy transfer and radiant exchange by coupling ice sheet models for the dynamics of the greenland and antarctic ice sheets , and one or more chemical transport models ( ctms ) for species important to climate atmospheric model intercomparison project ( amip ) atmospheric radiation measurement ( arm ) ( in the us ) earth simulator global environmental multiscale model ice-sheet model intermediate general circulation model ncar prognostic variable ipcc ar5 , evaluation of climate models with media including videos , animations , podcasts and transcripts on climate models gfdl 's flexible modeling system containing code for the climate models program for climate model diagnosis and intercomparison ( pcmdi/cmip ) national operational model archive and distribution system ( nomads ) hadley centre for climate prediction and research model info ncar/ucar community climate system model ( cesm ) climate prediction , community modeling nasa/giss , primary research gcm model edgcm/nasa : educational global climate modeling noaa/gfdl maoam : martian atmosphere observation and modeling / mpi & mipt
