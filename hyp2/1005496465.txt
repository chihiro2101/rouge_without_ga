he was educated at the grammar school of zittau ; he had an enduring love of the classical authors , publishing a translation of sophocles ' antigone into latin verse in his middle life he attended the university of leipzig as a student of philosophy and natural sciences , but entered officially as a student of medicine when he was seventeen lotze 's early studies were mostly governed by two distinct interests : the first was scientific , based upon mathematical and physical studies under the guidance of e the other was his aesthetic and artistic interest , which was developed under the care of the speculative theist christian hermann weisse he was attracted both by science and by the german idealism of johann gottlieb fichte , friedrich wilhelm joseph schelling and georg wilhelm friedrich hegel lotze 's first work was his dissertation de futurae biologiae principibus philosophicis , with which he gained in july 1838 the degree of doctor of medicine he laid the foundation of his philosophical system in his metaphysik ( leipzig , 1841 ) and his logik ( 1843 ) , short books published while still a junior lecturer at leipzig university , whence he moved to g√∂ttingen , succeeding johann friedrich herbart in the chair of philosophy he first became known to a larger circle through a series of works which aimed at establishing the study of both the physical and mental phenomena of the human organism the mechanical laws , to which external things were subject , were conceived as being valid only in the inorganic world mechanism was the unalterable connexion of every phenomenon a with other phenomena b , c , d , either as following or preceding it ; mechanism was the inexorable form into which the events of this world are cast , and by which they are connected in the last of the above-mentioned works the question is discussed at great length how we have to consider mind , and the relation between mind and body ; the answer is we have to consider mind as an immaterial principle , its action , however , on the body and vice versa as purely mechanical , indicated by the fixed laws of a psycho-physical mechanism these doctrines of lotze , though pronounced with the distinct and reiterated reservation that they did not contain a solution of the philosophical question regarding the nature of mechanism , were nevertheless by many considered to be the last word of the philosopher , a decisive rejection of the reveries of schelling and the idealistic theories of hegel published as they were during the years when the modern school of german materialism was at its height , these works of lotze were enrolled in the opposing camp of empiricism however , he admitted that the monadology of leibniz could be considered the forerunner of herbart 's teachings and also of his own views lotze worked in a post-revolutionary time of transition between the idealistic and rationalist legacies of leibniz , kant and hegel and the new materialism and scientific interpretation of reality he believed that everywhere in the wide realm of observation we find three distinct regions : the region of facts , the region of laws and the region of standards of value full understanding comes through conviction that the world of facts is the field in which those higher standards of moral and aesthetic value are being realized through the medium of laws such a union is , for him , only intelligible through the idea of a personal deity , who in the creation and preservation of a world has voluntarily chosen certain forms and laws , through the natural operation of which the ends of his work are gained in these lectures he expounded his peculiar views in a stricter form , and during the last decade of his life he embodied the substance of those courses in his system der philosophie , of which only two volumes have appeared ( vol the third and concluding volume , which was to treat in a more condensed form the principal problems of practical philosophy , of philosophy of art and religion , was not completed before his death his goal was to form some general idea how laws , facts and standards of value may be combined in one comprehensive view the course of things and their connexion is only thinkable by the assumption of a plurality of existences , the reality of which ( as distinguished from our knowledge of them ) can be conceived only as a multitude of relations that of a system of laws which governs the many things ? but , in attempting to make this conception quite clear and thinkable , we are forced to represent the connexion of things as a universal substance , the essence of which we conceive as a system of laws which underlies everything and in its own self connects everything , but is imperceptible , and known to us merely through the impressions it produces on us , which we call things what , however , with the idealists was an object of thought alone , the absolute , for lotze can not be defined in rigorous philosophical language ; the aspirations of the human heart , the contents of our feelings and desires , the aims of art and the tenets of religious faith must be grasped in order to fill the empty idea of the absolute with meaning these manifestations of the divine spirit again can not be traced and understood by reducing ( as hegel did ) the growth of the human mind in the individual , in society and in history to the monotonous rhythm of a speculative schematism the problem , '' how the one can be many '' , is only solved for us in the numberless examples in life and experience which surround us , for which we must retain a lifelong interest and which constitute the true field of all useful human work this conviction of the emptiness of terms and abstract notions , and of the fullness of individual life , led lotze to combine in his writings the two courses into which german philosophical thought had been moving since the death of its great founder , leibniz
