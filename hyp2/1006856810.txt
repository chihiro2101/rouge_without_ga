though several replacements for the munsell system have been invented , building on munsell 's foundational ideas—including the optical society of america 's osa-ucs , and the international commission on illumination ’ s cielab ( l a b ) and ciecam02 color models—the munsell system is still widely used , by , among others , ansi to define skin and hair colors for forensic pathology , the usgs for matching soil colors , in prosthodontics during the selection of shades for dental restorations , and brewery for matching beer colors the system consists of three independent properties of color which can be represented cylindrically in three dimensions as an irregular color solid : hue , measured by degrees around horizontal circles chroma , measured radially outward from the neutral ( gray ) vertical axis value , measured vertically on the core cylinder from 0 ( black ) to 10 ( white ) munsell determined the spacing of colors along these dimensions by taking measurements of human visual responses 20–21 albert munsell , an artist and professor of art at the massachusetts normal art school ( now massachusetts college of art and design , or massart ) , wanted to create a '' rational way to describe color '' that would use decimal notation instead of color names ( which he felt were '' foolish '' and '' misleading '' ) , , ch.1 , pg an edited version can be found at a description of color systems leading up to munsell 's , and a biographical explanation of munsell 's changing ideas about color and development of his color solid , leading up to the publication of a color notation in 1905 for instance , a purple of medium lightness and fairly saturated would be 5p 5/10 with 5p meaning the color in the middle of the purple hue band , 5/ meaning medium value ( lightness ) , and a chroma of 10 ( see swatch ) this led to a wide range of possible chroma levels—up to the high 30s for some hue–value combinations ( though it is difficult or impossible to make physical objects in colors of such high chromas , and they can not be reproduced on current computer displays ) several different shapes for such a solid were proposed , including : a double triangular pyramid by tobias mayer in 1758 , a single triangular pyramid by johann heinrich lambert in 1772 , a sphere by philipp otto runge in 1810 , a hemisphere by michel eugène chevreul in 1839 , a cone by hermann von helmholtz in 1860 , a tilted cube by william benson in 1868 , and a slanted double cone by august kirschmann in 1895 one of the first books about the munsell color system , explaining the intuition behind its three dimensions , and suggesting possible uses of the system in picking color combinations these were improved significantly in the 1929 munsell book of color and through an extensive series of experiments carried out by the optical society of america in the 1940s resulting in the notations ( sample definitions ) for the modern munsell book of color furthermore , none was based on any rigorous scientific measurement of human vision ; before munsell , the relationship between hue , value , and chroma was not understood a concise introduction to the munsell color system , on a web page which also discusses several other color systems , putting the munsell system in its historical context
