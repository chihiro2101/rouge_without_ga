on october 23 , 2017 , shaanan cohney , matthew green , and nadia heninger , cryptographers at the university of pennsylvania and johns hopkins university released details of the duhk ( do n't use hard-coded keys ) attack on wpa2 where hardware vendors use a hardcoded seed key for the ansi x9.31 rng algorithm in conjunction with the usage of the ansi x9.31 random number generator , '' an attacker can brute-force encrypted data to discover the rest of the encryption parameters and deduce the master encryption key used to encrypt web sessions or virtual private network ( vpn ) connections : when the maximum number of bits output from this prng is equal to the 2 blocksize , the resulting output delivers the mathematically expected security level that the key size would be expected to generate , but the output is shown to not be indistinguishable from a true random number generator : : example : if the csprng under consideration produces output by computing bits of π in sequence , starting from some unknown point in the binary expansion , it may well satisfy the next-bit test and thus be statistically random , as π appears to be a random sequence it has an uncontroversial design but has been proven to be weaker in terms of distinguishing attack , than the security level of the underlying block cipher when the number of bits output from this prng is greater than two to the power of the underlying block cipher 's block size in bits the guardian and the new york times have reported in 2013 that the national security agency ( nsa ) inserted a backdoor into a pseudorandom number generator ( prng ) of nist sp 800-90a which allows the nsa to readily decrypt material that was encrypted with the aid of dual_ec_drbg when the maximum number of bits output from this prng is less than it , the expected security level is delivered and the output appears to be indistinguishable from a true random number generator additionally , if there is an entropy input while running , it should be infeasible to use knowledge of the input 's state to predict future conditions of the csprng state that is , given the first k bits of a random sequence , there is no polynomial-time algorithm that can predict the ( k +1 ) th bit with probability of success non-negligibly better than 50 % in the event that part or all of its state has been revealed ( or guessed correctly ) , it should be impossible to reconstruct the stream of random numbers prior to the revelation second , for most prngs , when their state has been revealed , all past random numbers can be retrodicted , allowing an attacker to read all past messages , as well as future ones
