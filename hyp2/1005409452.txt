the area to the south of long acre contains the royal opera house , the market and central square , and most of the elegant buildings , theatres and entertainment facilities , including the theatre royal , drury lane , and the london transport museum ; while the area to the north of long acre is largely given over to independent retail units centred on neal street , neal 's yard and seven dials ; though this area also contains residential buildings such as odhams walk , built in 1981 on the site of the odhams print works , and is home to 7,000 residents the use of the name '' covent '' —an anglo-french term for a religious community , equivalent to '' monastery '' or '' convent '' ; also see —appears in a document in 1515 , when the abbey , which had been letting out parcels of land along the north side of the strand for inns and market gardens , granted a lease of the walled garden , referring to it as '' a garden called covent garden '' the salisbury in st martin 's lane was built as part of a six-storey block around 1899 on the site of an earlier pub that had been known under several names , including the coach & horses and ben caunt 's head ; it is both grade ii listed , and on camra 's national inventory , due to the quality of the etched and polished glass and the carved woodwork , summed up as '' good fin de siècle ensemble '' the centrepiece of the project was the large square , the concept of which was new to london , and this had a significant influence on modern town planning as the metropolis grew , acting as the prototype for the design of new estates , such as the ladbroke estate and the grosvenor estate the original market , consisting of wooden stalls and sheds , became disorganised and disorderly , and john russell , 6th duke of bedford , requested an act of parliament in 1813 to regulate it , then commissioned charles fowler in 1830 to design the neo-classical market building that is the heart of covent garden today the bedford estate was expanded by the inheritance of the former manor of bloomsbury to the immediate north of covent garden following the marriage of william russell , lord russell ( 1639–1683 ) ( third son of william russell , 1st duke of bedford of woburn abbey in bedfordshire ) to rachel wriothesley , heiress of bloomsbury , younger of the two daughters and co-heiresses of thomas wriothesley , 4th earl of southampton ( 1607-1667 ) other grade ii listed pubs include three 19th century rebuilds of 17th century/18th century houses , the nell gwynne tavern in bull inn court , the nag 's head on james street , and the white swan on new row ; a victorian pub built by lessees of the marquis of exeter , the old bell on the corner of exeter street and wellington street ; and a late 18th or early 19th century pub the angel and crown on st martin 's lane covent garden was home to some of london 's earliest coffee shops , such as old slaughter 's coffee house , which ran from 1692 until 1843 , and a beefsteak club , the sublime society of beef steaks , which was co-founded in 1736 by william hogarth at the theatre royal ( now the royal opera house ) the square was originally laid out when the 4th earl of bedford , francis russell , commissioned inigo jones to design and build a church and three terraces of fine houses around the site of a former walled garden belonging to westminster abbey during a reorganisation in 1542 it was transferred to st martin in the fields , and then in 1645 a new parish was created , splitting governance of the estate between the parishes of st paul covent garden and st martin , both still within the liberty of westminster the area to the north of the strand was long thought to have remained as unsettled fields until the 16th century , but theories by alan vince and martin biddle that there had been an anglo-saxon settlement to the west of the old roman town of londinium were borne out by excavations in 1985 and 2005 historically , the bedford estate defined the boundary of covent garden , with drury lane to the east , the strand to the south , st martin 's lane to the west , and long acre to the north after the dissolution of the monasteries in 1540 under king henry viii , monastic lands in england reverted to the crown , including lands belonging to westminster abbey such as the convent garden and seven acres to the north called long acre for much of its first two centuries , it was , along with the royal opera house , a patent theatre granted rights in london for the production of drama , and had a claim to be one of london 's leading theatres since 1965 covent garden falls within the london boroughs of westminster and camden , and is in the parliamentary constituencies of cities of london and westminster and holborn and st pancras the following year the market relocated to its new site , new covent garden market , about three miles ( 5 & nbsp ; km ) south-west at nine elms the covent garden building has on display many examples of buses , trams , trolleybuses and rail vehicles from the 19th and 20th centuries as well as artefacts and exhibits related to the operation and marketing of passenger services and the impact that the developing transport network has had on the city and its population by the 13th century this had become a quadrangle of mixed orchard , meadow , pasture and arable land , lying between modern-day st martin 's lane and drury lane , and floral street and maiden lane there is a wide range of restaurants , mainly in covent garden 's central area around the piazza , and in the st martin 's lane area bordering the west end ; some of these with international reputations the central hall has shops , cafes and bars alongside the apple market stalls selling antiques , jewellery , clothing and gifts ; there are additional casual stalls in the jubilee hall market on the south side of the square during the roman period , what is now the strand – running along the southern boundary of the area that was to become covent garden – was part of the route to silchester , known as '' iter vii '' on the antonine itinerary these arcades , rather than the square itself , took the name piazza ; the group from james street to russell street became known as the '' great piazza '' and that to the south of russell street as the '' little piazza '' the central building re-opened as a shopping centre in 1980 , with cafes , pubs , small shops and a craft market called the apple market the first mention of a pub on the site is 1772 ( when it was called the cooper 's arms – the name changing to lamb & flag in 1833 ) ; the 1958 brick exterior conceals what may be an early 18th-century frame of a house replacing the original one built in 1638 russell built bedford house and garden on part of the land , with an entrance on the strand , the large garden stretching back along the south side of the old walled-off convent garden covent garden is licensed for street entertainment , and performers audition for timetabled slots in a number of venues around the market , including the north hall , west piazza , and south hall courtyard the royal opera house , known as '' covent garden '' , was constructed as the '' theatre royal '' in 1732 to a design by edward shepherd by the end of the 1960s , traffic congestion had reached such a level that the use of the square as a modern wholesale distribution market was becoming untenable , and significant redevelopment was planned this had been prompted by king charles i having taken offence at the poor condition of the road and houses along long acre , which were the responsibility of russell and henry carey , 2nd earl of monmouth since 1971 , with the creation of the covent garden conservation area which incorporated part of the area between st martin 's lane and charing cross road , charing cross road has sometimes been taken as its western boundary during the first hundred years or so of its history , the theatre was primarily a playhouse , with the letters patent granted by charles ii giving covent garden and theatre royal , drury lane , exclusive rights to present spoken drama in london covent garden has 13 theatres , and over 60 pubs and bars , with most south of long acre , around the main shopping area of the old market the central square in covent garden is simply called '' covent garden '' , often marketed as '' covent garden piazza '' to distinguish it from the eponymous surrounding area in 1630 francis russell , 4th earl of bedford commissioned the architect inigo jones to design and build a church and three terraces of fine houses around a large square or piazza the houses initially attracted the wealthy , though they moved out when a market developed on the south side of the square around 1654 , and coffee houses , taverns , and prostitutes moved in the freemasons arms on long acre is linked with the founding of the football association in 1863 ; however , the meetings took place at the freemason 's tavern on great queen street , which was replaced in 1909 by the connaught rooms
