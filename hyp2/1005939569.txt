at the time , a number of systems were being proposed that used separate red , green and blue signals ( rgb ) , broadcast in succession each frame encoded one color of the picture , and the wheel spun in sync with the signal so the correct gel was in front of the screen when that colored frame was being displayed rca was included in this group ; on 5 february 1940 they demonstrated a system using three conventional tubes combined to form a single image on a plate of glass , but the image was too dim to be useful his design , the telechrome , used two electron guns aimed at either side of a phosphor covered plate in the center of the tube a similar project was the geer tube , which used a similar arrangement of guns aimed at the back of a single plate covered with small three-sided phosphor covered pyramids in spite of their best efforts , the wide electron beams simply could not focus tightly enough to hit the individual dots , at least over the entirety of the screen moreover , most of these devices were unwieldy ; the arrangement of the electron guns around the outside of the screen resulted in a very large display with considerable '' dead space '' a more practical system would use a single gun at the back of the tube , firing at a single multi-color screen on the front another contender was general electric 's penetron , which used three stacked layers of phosphor and attempted to change the power of the electron beam to write to the correct one paramount pictures worked long and hard on the chromatron , which used a set of wires behind the screen as a secondary '' gun '' , further focussing the beam and steering it towards the correct color philco 's '' apple '' tube used additional stripes of phosphor that released a burst of electrons when the electron beam swept across them , by timing the bursts it could adjust the passage of the beam and hit the correct colors in 1938 german inventor werner flechsig first patented ( received 1941 , france ) the seemingly simple concept of placing a sheet of metal just behind the front of the tube , and punching small holes in it the guns , arranged in a delta pattern at the back of the tube , were aimed to focus on the metal plate and scanned it as normal normally the beams from the three guns would each be large enough to light up all three colored dots on the screen after being cut off by the mask , the beams would continue forward at slightly different angles , hitting the screens at slightly different locations the spread was a function of the distance between the guns at the back of the tube , and the distance between the mask plate and the screen by painting the colored dots at the correct locations on the screen , and leaving some room between them to avoid interactions , the guns would be guaranteed to hit the right colored spot as the beam swept the mask , the vast majority of its energy was deposited on the mask , not the screen in front of it to produce an image as bright as the one on a traditional b & w television , the electron guns in this hypothetical shadow mask system would have to be five times more powerful additionally , the dots on the screen were deliberately separated in order to avoid being hit by the wrong gun , so much of the screen was black if you consider the beam when it is sweeping across the middle area of the screen , the beams from the individual guns are each traveling the same distance and meet the holes in the mask at equal angles in the corners of the screen some beams have to travel farther and all of them meet the hole at a different angle than at the middle of the screen at the time there were very few television sets in use in the united states , so the stakeholder groups quickly settled on the idea of using uhf for a new , incompatible , color format it starts out with a sheet of steel or invar alloy that is coated with photoresist , which is baked to solidify it , exposed to uv light through photomasks , developed to remove unexposed resist , the metal is etched using liquid acid , and then the photoresist is removed the shadow mask is installed to the screen using metal pieces or a rail or frame that is fused to the funnel or the screen glass respectively , holding the shadow mask in tension to minimize warping ( if the mask is flat , used in flat screen crt computer monitors ) and allowing for higher image brightness and contrast the porta-color used both of these advances and re-arranged the guns to lie beside each other instead of in a triangle , allowing the dots to be extended vertically into slots that covered much more of the screen surface however , the improved contrast compared to ambient conditions allowed the faceplate to be made much more clear , allowing more light from the phosphor to reach the viewer and the actual brightness to increase in manufacturing color crts , the shadow masks or aperture grilles were also used to expose photoresist on the faceplate to ultraviolet light sources , accurately positioned to simulate arriving electrons for one color at a time
