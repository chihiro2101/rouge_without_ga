it is unclear why windmills were not employed , as they were on the fens of east anglia , but only two examples have been recorded on the levels : one at bleadon at the mouth of the river axe , where a sea wall had been built , and the other at common moor north of glastonbury , which was being drained following a private act of parliament in 1721 in 1795 , john billingsley advocated enclosure and the digging of rhynes ( a local name for drainage channels , pronounced '' reens '' in the east and rhyne to the west ) between plots , and wrote in his agriculture of the county of somerset that had been enclosed in the last 20 years in wedmore and meare , at nyland , at blackford , at mark , in shapwick , and at westhay as part of the published flood risk assessments for both these sub-areas , it is recognised that : at a future date a tidal clyse may be needed on the parrett ; this causes a funding dilemma ; and , geomorphology studies of the parrett and the tone are needed to help address many of the uncertainties associated with a tidal exclusion project the industry is celebrated in the form of the willow man ( sometimes known as the angel of the south ) , a willow sculpture , 40 & nbsp ; feet ( 12.2 & nbsp ; m ) tall , produced by artist serena de la hey in september 2000 that can be seen from the railway and the m5 motorway to the north of bridgwater in 2010 and 2011 , two proposals to build a total of 14 wind turbines , with ecotricity to build five or four adjacent to the m5 motorway near brent knoll and électricité de france to build nine at east huntspill , are opposed by local groups on the grounds of their effect on the local environment and potential damage to the bird population the main drainage outlets flowing through the moors and levels are the rivers axe , brue , huntspill , parrett , tone , and yeo , together with the king 's sedgemoor drain , an artificial channel into which the river cary now runs in february 2009 somerset county council , the owner of the peat moors centre , announced its intention of closing the centre and it finally shut on 31 october 2009 , but it was reopened as the avalon marshes centre and is in the process of being modernized and improved from the previous set of buildings the levels contain 32 & nbsp ; site of special scientific interest ( 12 of them also special protection areas ) , the river huntspill and bridgwater bay national nature reserves , the somerset levels and moors ramsar site covering about , the somerset levels national nature reserve , shapwick heath , ham wall national nature reserve and numerous scheduled monuments in addition , the problems of high fresh water floods are aggravated by the unrestricted entry of the tide along the parrett , which is the only river in the levels and moors that does not have a clyse on it discussions on whether a clyse is needed for the parrett and whether it should be sited at bridgwater or nearer the mouth of the river date back to 1939 , at the start of world war ii , and have not been resolved a survey in 2005 discovered that 11 of the known wooden bronze age causeways on the levels had been destroyed or vanished and others were seriously damaged , caused by the reduction in water levels and subsequent exposure of the timber to oxygen and aerobic organism the westonzoyland pumping station museum , near the town on the river parrett , is housed in one of the earliest steam-powered pumping stations on the levels , dating from the 1830s ; it was closed in the 1950s in 1597 , of land were recovered near the parrett estuary ; a few years later , near pawlett were recovered by means of embankments ; and three further reclamations , totalling , had been undertaken downstream of bridgwater by 1660 water levels are managed by the levels internal drainage boards ( idbs ) ; the levels are not as intensively drained or farmed as the east anglian fens , historically a similar area of low marsh the avalon marshes centre ( formerly known as the peat moors centre ) between westhay and shapwick , is dedicated to the natural history , biodiversity , archaeology , history , and geology of the area other local industries that once thrived on the levels , such as thatching ( using reeds ) and basket making ( using willow ) , have been in decline since the second half of the 20th century a section , which lies within the land owned by the nature conservancy council , has been surrounded by a clay bank to prevent drainage into surrounding lower peat fields , and water levels are regularly monitored it was intended that in the summer , when water supply was lower , it would serve as a reservoir with water pumped from the moors ; and in winter serve as a drainage channel , via gravity drainage on 24 january 2014 , in light of the continued flooded extent of the somerset moors and forecast new rainfall as part of the winter storms of 2013–14 in the united kingdom , both somerset county council and sedgemoor district council declared a major incident several settlements and hill forts were built on the natural '' islands '' of slightly raised land , including brent knoll , glastonbury , and the low range of the polden hills the moors and levels , formed from a submerged and reclaimed landscape , consist of a coastal clay belt only slightly above mean sea level , with an inland peat belt at a lower level behind it the tribunal in glastonbury , a medieval merchant 's house , contains possessions and works of art from the glastonbury lake village , which were preserved in almost perfect condition in the peat after the village was abandoned discovered in 1892 by arthur bulleid , it was inhabited by about 200 & nbsp ; people living in 14 & nbsp ; roundhouses , and was built on a marsh on an artificial foundation of timber filled with brushwood , bracken , rubble and clay it is the site of an iron age hill fort known as brent knoll camp , with multiple ramparts ( multivallate ) following the contours of the hill environment minister owen paterson visited the area on 27 january 2014 , and after meeting local mps , the environment agency and various community representatives the night before in taunton , promised at a media-only press conference at north moor pumping station that if a local water management plan could be developed over the next six weeks , he would approve it at this time , with of agricultural land having been under water for over a month , the village of thorney had been abandoned and muchelney had been cut off by flood waters for almost a month the birds ' eggs were flown from germany to the wwt slimbridge managed by the wildfowl & wetlands trust ( a uk charity ) at slimbridge , gloucestershire , and reared to the age of five months before being released onto the levels however , idbs have been actively participating with the parrett catchment partnership , a partnership of 30 organisations that aims to create a consensus on how water is to be managed , in particular , looking at new ways to achieve sustainable benefits for all local stakeholders also in glastonbury , the somerset rural life museum is a museum of the social and agricultural history of somerset , housed in buildings surrounding a 14th-century barn once belonging to glastonbury abbey the track was built between what was in the early 4th & nbsp ; millennium bc an island at westhay and a ridge of high ground at shapwick , close to the river brue from january until may , the river parrett provides a source of european eels ( anguilla anguilla ) and young elvers , which are caught by hand netting as this is the only legal means of catching them from time to time the centre offers events and courses in a number of ancient technologies in subjects including textiles , clothing and basket-making , as well as staging various open days , displays , demonstrations and guided nature excursions the work of john coles and the somerset levels project was recognised in 1998 when they won the ici award for the best archaeological project offering a major contribution to knowledge , and in 2006 with the award of the european archaeological heritage prize the area is an important feeding ground for birds including tundra swan , eurasian curlew , common redshank , eurasian skylark , common snipe , eurasian teal , wigeon , and eurasian whimbrel , as well as birds of prey including the marsh harrier and peregrine falcon along with the rest of south west england the somerset levels have a temperate climate , which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of the country early attempts to control the water levels were possibly made by the romans ( although records only date from the 13th & nbsp ; century ) , but were not widespread the centre also contains the offices and workshops for the rspb , somerset wildlife trust , natural england and the hawk and owl trust for which all have reserves close by subsequent winter flooding probably led to prehistoric man 's using the levels only in the summer , hence the county of somerset may derive its name from sumorsaete , meaning land of the summer people water voles ( arvicola amphibius ) are being encouraged to recolonise areas of the levels where they have been absent for 10 & nbsp ; years , by the capture of mink ( mustela vison ) the viability of this method is demonstrated by comparing it with the nearby abbot 's way , which has not had similar treatment , and which in 1996 was found to have become dewatered and desiccated the area continued to be inhabited during the bronze age , when the population supported itself largely by hunting and fishing in the surrounding marshes , living on artificial islands connected by wooden causeways on wooden piles following purchase of land by the national heritage memorial fund , and installation of a water pumping and distribution system along a section , several hundred metres of the track 's length are now being actively conserved a range of archaeological projects , such as the exploration of various trackways from the 3rd and 1st millennia bc and the establishment of their economic and geographic significance , was funded by various donors including english heritage in the early 17th century , during the time of king james i , abortive plans were made to drain and enclose much of sedgemoor , which the local lords supported but opposed by the commoners who would have lost grazing rights
