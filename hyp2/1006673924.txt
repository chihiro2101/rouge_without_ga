upon their mastery of the strategy and timing listed in the five books , musashi states that you will be able to defeat ten men as easily as you could defeat one , and asks : '' when you have reached this point , will it not mean that you are invincible ? '' the strategies listed in this discipline or book relate to situations requiring different weapons and tactics , such as indoor weapons right image : miyamoto musashi killing a giant nue.jpg thumb miyamoto musashi killing a giant creature , from the book of five rings although it is difficult to grasp it from the book , go rin no sho , these books are actually the teachings which musashi preached to his students in his own dōjō '' no attitude '' refers to those strategists who do not go with the use of the '' five attitudes '' and prefer to simply go without the attitudes of the long sword to focus entirely on technique , as opposed to focusing on both technique and the five attitudes '' the book has many paragraphs on the subject of other schools ' techniques , and much of the text lists the ways that other schools do not conform to the ideals which he himself writes about in the book of five rings , such as footwork , sight , and over-reliance or over-familiarity with a weapon aside from this philosophical approach to the meaning , the technique is relatively simple to explain : if you are in a deadlock with the enemy , using the force from the cut , you push with your body and use the disciplines outlined in the void book to knock the enemy over however , the type of timing in this instance is somewhat different from the timing noted in the ground book since this variety of timing requires looking at the various physical factors which affect an enemy during battle , such as determining if strength is waning or rising within a group of troopers '' void , as such , is also empty of the sense of self ( anatta ) , good and evil , wanting and non-wanting , and is the spiritual dynamic that forms the jumping off point to satori , enlightenment as each is thought of as an attitude , it could be thought of that musashi means to practice with each '' attitude '' so that you do not become over-reliant upon one , something which musashi repeatedly notes as being worse than bad technique there is a strategy above sword-fencing : '' some of the world 's strategists are concerned only with sword-fencing , and limit their training to flourishing the long sword and carriage of the body although it is not mentioned , musashi must have been well aware that this method would also be the most likely to have a higher death count than the others due to the sheer mass of enemies because more than one enemy could then attack a single soldier or trooper in regards to the gaze of someone , he notes that a person must be able to perceive that which is all around him without moving their eyeballs noticeably , which is said to be a skill which takes an enormous amount of practice to perfect the attitude of '' existing - non existing '' , mixes the five attitudes with the attitude of '' no attitude '' , meaning that the user of the longsword uses the techniques and principles of both at whichever moment he or she finds most opportune these rules are for his students , and are complemented by the 21 '' spiritual principles '' for all to follow , which are found in the dokkōdō ( musashi 's final work ) he notes that this is again one of the most important parts of strategy , as well as being able to see things which are close to you , such as the technique of an enemy in terms of stance , much like balance within the trooper , musashi notes that stance is an important part of strategy , or battle : adopt a stance with the head erect , neither hanging down , nor looking up , nor twisted it is rumored that musashi disgraced a former sword master by using such a technique with a bokken , but there are no descriptions mentioning '' in one '' timing this is something which seems easy , but it is said to change when you are on the battlefield , as then you must know to both adjust your spiritual balance according to what is around you , and to perceive the balance of those around you to take advantage accordingly musashi states that the use of glaive-like naginata and spears are purely for the field , whereas the longsword and accompanying short-sword can be used in most environments , such as on horseback or in fierce battle when you are distant , you will exchange blows of the sword , and it will be rather easy to move closer to your opponent ( thomas cleary translates this technique as '' body of the short-armed monkey '' the five '' books '' refer to the idea that there are different elements of battle , just as there are different physical elements in life , as described by buddhism , shinto , and other eastern religions he indicates that his appraisal may be one sided because the only school he had interest for was his own , and , in a way , he does not see parallels to his own creation and work '' abdomen timing of two '' refers to feinting an attack , then striking an enemy as they are retreating from the attack , hitting them in the abdomen with the correct timing of either two moves or two seconds whereas most of the information given in the previous books is useful in such a way that it could still be applicable today , this book is primarily concerned with the specific details about other strategies that existed at the time at this point in time , you need to completely equip yourself into the action of striking with your sword , and strike whenever you may see an opening , whether it may be the legs , arms , or head however , you can become a master of strategy by training alone with a sword , so that you can understand the enemy 's stratagems , his strength and resources , and come to appreciate how to apply strategy to beat ten thousand enemies . the earth book , according to '' go rin no sho '' , is mentioned as the book that refers expressly to the strategy taught by musashi at the ichi school in the book of five rings he writes on timing : '' timing is important in dancing and pipe or string music , for they are in rhythm only if timing is good he notes that in this void , what can be comprehended are things which we do and see , such as the way of the warrior , martial arts , and ni ten ichi ryu musashi indicates that during battle you should not overuse one weapon—this is as bad as using the weapon poorly since it becomes easy for an enemy to find a weakness in your style after countless uses of the same weapon these are areas which are noted for their advantages when striking at an enemy , and the strategist is said to think of them when in situations where , for any reason , you should not be able to strike them it was known that in such battles , drummers drummed a tune for their other fellow soldiers to march to ; and , if the rhythm was lost , it led to a '' collapse when their rhythm becomes deranged '' as there is collapse within an enemy , such as waning in his numbers , musashi notes that one must observe such events and use them to advantage emptiness , and the establishing of the conditions that allow it to arise , is a common theme in zen buddhist meditation practice , which no doubt informed the perspective of the author the main idea being to feign weakness as to open a weak spot , or achilles ' heel , in the opposing force , and then regrouping to exploit such a hole by attacking deep within the enemy 's party from the outset you must know the applicable timing and the inapplicable timing , and from among the large and small things and the fast and slow timings find the relevant timing , first seeing the distance timing and the background timing at the same time , in the void , things we do not do or see ( which he calls spirit ) are part of the information which we perceive on a conscious level , but with which we have no physical relationship however , he still admits that without basic understanding of these alternate techniques , you will not be able to learn ni ten ichi ryu , probably for reasons of finding the wrongs in other techniques , and righting them within yourself in ni ten ichi ryu the book of wind chapter is something of a pun , since the japanese character can mean both '' wind '' and '' style '' ( e.g when referring to such books , it refers to '' niten no ichi ryu '' or '' ni ten ichi ryu '' , which literally translates to , '' two heaven , one school '' the idea of timing as explained within the earth book is that you must be able to adapt your strategy to timing with your skill , in that you must know when to attack and when not to attack
