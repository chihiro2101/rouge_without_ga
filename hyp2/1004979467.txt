some of the strategies in use include : when random bits are requested , return that many bits derived from the entropy pool ( by a cryptographic hash function , say ) and decrement the estimate of the number of random bits remaining in the pool one example of a centralized system where a random number can be acquired is the randomness beacon service from the national institute of standards and technology ; another example is random.org , a service that uses atmospheric noise to generate random binary digits ( bits ) random numbers are also used for non-gambling purposes , both where their use is mathematically important , such as sampling for opinion polls , and in situations where fairness is approximated by randomization , such as conscription and selecting jurors when several such sources are combined carefully ( as in , for example , the yarrow algorithm or fortuna csprngs ) , enough entropy can be collected for the creation of cryptographic keys and nonces , though generally at restricted rates although these pseudorandom sequences pass randomness tests , by knowing the algorithm and the conditions used to initialize it , called the '' seed '' , the output can be predicted in the absence of quantum effects or thermal noise , other phenomena that tend to be random , although in ways not easily characterized by laws of physics , can be used unpredictable random numbers were first investigated in the context of gambling , and many randomizing devices such as dice , shuffling playing cards , and roulette wheels , were first developed for such use noise ( radio ) , detected by a radio receiver attached to a pc ( though much of it , such as lightning noise , is not properly thermal noise , but most likely a chaotic phenomenon ) new randomness is added whenever available ( for example , when the user hits a key ) and an estimate of the number of bits in the pool that can not be known to an attacker is kept a geiger counter ( with a sample time longer than the tube recovery time ) or a semi-transparent mirror photon detector both generate bit streams that are mostly '' 0 '' ( silent or transmission ) with the occasional '' 1 '' ( click or reflection ) the major use for hardware random number generators is in the field of data encryption , for example to create random cryptographic keys and nonces needed to encrypt and sign data '' q for quantum , john gribbin are fundamentally random and can not , in principle , be predicted ( for a discussion of empirical verification of quantum unpredictability , see bell test experiments ) these are useful for determining if there is enough entropy in a seed pool , for example , but they can not , in general , distinguish between a true random source and a pseudorandom generator some designs apply cryptographic hash functions such as md5 , sha-1 , or ripemd-160 or even a crc function to all or part of the bit stream , and then use the output as the random bit stream and , because the world exists at a temperature above absolute zero , every system has some random variation in its state ; for instance , molecules of gases composing air are constantly bouncing off each other in a random way ( see statistical mechanics they are a more secure alternative to pseudorandom number generators ( prngs ) , software programs commonly used in computers to generate '' random '' numbers it considers two bits at a time ( non-overlapping ) , taking one of three actions : when two successive bits are equal , they are discarded ; a sequence of 1,0 becomes a 1 ; and a sequence of 0,1 becomes a zero on 29 april 1947 , rand corporation began generating random digits with an '' electronic roulette wheel '' , consisting of a random frequency pulse source of about 100,000 pulses per second gated once per second with a constant frequency pulse and fed into a five-bit binary counter this can improve decorrelation and digit bias at low cost ; it can be done by hardware , such as an fpga , which is faster than doing it by software quantum mechanics predicts that certain physical phenomena , such as the nuclear decay of atoms , '' each nucleus decays spontaneously , at random , in accordance with the blind workings of chance if each bit is independent from the others , the von neumann strategy generates one random , unbiased output bit for each of the rare '' 1 '' bits in such a highly biased bit stream hardware random number generators produce sequences of numbers that are assumed not to be predictable , and therefore provide the greatest security when used to encrypt data a thermal noise source ( non-commonmode noise from two diodes ) is used to modulate the frequency of the slow oscillator , which then triggers a measurement of the fast oscillator other designs use what are believed to be true random bits as the key for a high quality block cipher algorithm , taking the encrypted output as the random bit stream there are two fundamental sources of practical quantum mechanics physical randomness : quantum mechanics at the atomic or sub-atomic level and thermal noise ( some of which is quantum mechanical in origin ) they are somewhat vulnerable to attack by lowering the temperature of the system , though most systems will stop operating at temperatures low enough to reduce noise by a factor of two ( e.g another technique for improving a near random bit stream is to xor the bit stream with the output of a high-quality cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator such as blum blum shub or a strong stream cipher the primary source of randomness typically used in such approaches is the precise timing of the interrupts caused by mechanical input/output devices , such as keyboards and disk drives , various system information counters , etc because the outcome of quantum-mechanical events can not be predicted even in principle , they are the ‘ gold standard ’ for random number generation however , with sufficient care , a system can be designed that produces cryptographically secure random numbers from the sources of randomness available in a modern computer the output of two are xored to control the bias on a third oscillator , whose output clocks the output of the fourth oscillator to produce the raw bit an example is measuring the time between user keystrokes , and then taking the least significant bit ( or two or three ) of the count as a random digit the linux '' /dev/urandom '' device is a simple modification which disregards estimates of input randomness , and is therefore rather less likely to have high entropy as a result
