borane clusters are classified as follows , where n is the number of boron atoms in a single cluster : pp 151-195 the iupac nomenclature of chemistry for systematic naming is based on a prefix denoting a class of compound , followed by the number of boron atoms and finally the number of hydrogen atoms in parentheses image : borane-3d-balls.png borane bh 3 image : diborane-3d-balls-a.png diborane b 2 h 6 image : tetraborane-3d-balls.png tetraborane b 4 h 10 image : pentaborane ( 9 ) -from-xtal-view-1-mercury-3d-bs.png pentaborane ( 9 ) b 5 h 9 image : decaborane ( 14 ) -from-xtal-view-1-tilt-3d-bs-17.png decaborane b 10 h 14 image : dodecaborate ( 12 ) -dianion-from-xtal-3d-bs-17.png dodecaborate b 12 h 12 2− image : b18h22 from xray coordinates.tif b 18 h 22 image : iso-b18h22 from xray coordinates.tif iso-b 18 h 22 the naming of anions is illustrated by : octahydridopentaborate , b 5 h 8 & minus ; the hydrogen count is specified first followed by the boron count for example , in the icosahedral ion b 12 h 12 2- , the totally symmetric ( a g symmetry ) molecular orbital is equally distributed among all 12 boron atoms with an alkali metal hydride , for example , : b 2 h 6 + 2 h − → 2 bh 4 − further demonstrating that they are not in general '' electron-deficient '' ( see above ) , boranes can also function as electron donors owing to the relative basic character of the low-polarity b-h terminal groups , as in reactions with halogens to form haloboranes the reaction of some lower boranes with air is strongly exothermic ; those of b 2 h 6 and b 5 h 9 , for example , occur explosively except in very low concentration for example : b 2 h 6 ( g ) + 3 o 2 ( g ) → b 2 o 3 ( s ) + 3 h 2 o ( g ) the formation of the solid releases additional energy to what is released by the oxidation reaction by contrast , many closo-borane anions , such as b 12 h 12 2− , do not react with air ; salts of these anions are metastable because the closo- structure creates a very high activation energy barrier to oxidation for example , pentaborane ( 9 ) reacts with trimethylphosphine : b 5 h 9 + 2 pme 3 → b 5 h 9 ( pme 3 ) 2 producing what can be regarded as a derivative of the unknown hypho-borane b 5 h 13 : b 5 h 9 6 h 10 10 h 14 16 h 20 18 h 22 reaction of a borane with the transient bh 3 , produced by dissociation of b 2 h 6 , can lead to the formation of a conjuncto-borane species in which two small borane sub-units are joined by the sharing of boron atoms 162 : b 6 h 10 + ( bh 3 ) → b 7 h 11 + h 2 : b 7 h 11 + b 6 h 10 → b 13 h 19 + h 2 other conjuncto-boranes , where the sub-units are joined by a b-b bond , can be made by ultra violet irradiation of nido-boranes 177 , '' the concept of boranes as ligands '' , hapticity of η 1 to η 6 have been found , with electron donation involving bridging h atoms or donation from b-b bonds
