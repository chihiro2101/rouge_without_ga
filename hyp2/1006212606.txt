towns and cities in the drakensberg area include , from south to north , matatiele and barkly east in the kwa-zulu natal province ; ladysmith , newcastle , ulundi – the former zulu capital , dundee , and ixopo in kwazulu-natal ; all of lesotho , whose capital is maseru ; and tzaneen in limpopo province in the main , the rocks of the kwazulu-natal midlands belong to the beaufort and ecca groups ( of the karoo supergroup ) , aged 220–310 & nbsp ; million years , and are therefore considerably older than the drakensberg lavas ( aged 180 & nbsp ; million years ) that cap the escarpment on the border between kwazulu-natal and lesotho the absence of the great escarpment for approximately to the north of tzaneen ( to reappear on the border between zimbabwe and mozambique in the chimanimani mountains ) is due to a failed westerly branch of the main rift that caused antarctica to start drifting away from southern africa during the breakup of gondwana about 150 million years ago north of lesotho the range becomes lower and less rugged until entering mpumalanga where the quartzite mountains of the transvaal drakensberg are loftier and more broken and they form the eastern rim of the transvaal basin , the blyde river canyon lying within this stretch it reaches its highest point ( above where the escarpment forms part of the international border between lesotho and the south african province of kwazulu-natal the highest portion of the great escarpment is known in zulu as ukhahlamba and as maluti in sotho ( '' barrier of up-pointed spears '' ) adjacent to the ukhahlamba drakensberg world heritage site is the 1900 ha allendale mountain reserve , which is the largest private reserve adjoining the world heritage site and is found in the accessible kamberg area , the heart of the historic san rock art of the ukhahlamba the portion of the drakensberg that forms the kwazulu-natal – free state border is formed by slightly younger beaufort group ( 250 & nbsp ; million years old ) that also are part of the karoo supergroup one bird is endemic to the high peaks , the mountain pipit ( anthus hoeschi ) , and another six species are found mainly here : bush blackcap ( lioptilus nigricapillus ) , buff-streaked chat ( oenanthe bifasciata ) , rudd 's lark ( heteromirafra ruddi ) , drakensberg rockjumper ( chaetops aurantius ) , yellow-breasted pipit ( anthus chloris ) , and drakensberg siskin ( serinus symonsi ) the limpopo and mpumalanga drakensberg are capped by an erosion resistant quartzite layer that is part of the transvaal supergroup , which also forms the magaliesberg to the north and northwest of pretoria '' the site also indicates that '' the rock art of the drakensberg is the largest and most concentrated group of rock paintings in africa south of the sahara , and is outstanding both in quality and diversity of subject the erosional retreat of the escarpment from the coast to its present position , means that the rocks of the coastal plain are , with very few and small exceptions , older than those that cap the top of the escarpment due to the materials used in their production , these paintings are difficult to date , but there is anthropological evidence , including many hunting implements , that the san people existed in the drakensberg at least 40,000 years ago , and possibly more than 100,000 years ago other notable peaks include mafadi , makoaneng at , njesuthi at , champagne castle at , giant 's castle at , ben macdhui at , and popple peak at , all of these are in the area bordering on lesotho , which contains an area popular for hikers , cathedral peak the drakensberg that form the northeastern and eastern borders of lesotho , as well as the eastern cape drakensberg , are composed of a thick layer of basalt ( lava ) that erupted 180 million years ago the grassy lower slopes ( from of the drakensberg in swaziland , south africa and lesotho constitute the drakensberg montane grasslands , woodlands , and forests ecoregion the rivers that run from the drakensberg are an essential resource for south africa 's economy , providing water for the industrial provinces of mpumalanga and gauteng , which contains the city of johannesburg the plateau is tilted such that its highest point is in the east , and it slopes gently downward toward the west and south the limpopo , mpumalanga , and lesotho drakensberg have hard erosion-resistant upper surfaces and therefore have a very rugged appearance , combining steep-sided blocks and pinnacles ( giving rise to the zulu name '' barrier of up-pointed spears '' ) there is one endemic frog , forest rain frog ( breviceps sylvestris ) , and four more species that are found mainly in these mountains ; long-toed tree frog ( leptopelis xenodactylus ) , plaintive rain frog ( breviceps maculatus ) , rough rain frog ( breviceps verrucosus ) , and poynton 's caco ( cacosternum poyntoni ) the lower slopes of the drakensberg support much wildlife , perhaps most importantly the rare southern white rhinoceros ( which was nurtured here when facing extinction ) and the black wildebeest ( connochaetes gnou , which only thrives in protected areas and game reserves )
