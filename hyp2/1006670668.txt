the metaphysical poets , the cavalier poets and the school of spenser as with the poets of the first world war , the work of these writers can be seen as something of an interlude in the history of 20th century poetry in the work of john clare the late augustan voice is blended with a peasant 's first-hand knowledge to produce arguably some of the finest nature poetry in the english language towards the end of the 18th century , poetry began to move away from the strict augustan ideals and a new emphasis on the sentiment and feelings of the poet was established the 18th century is sometimes called the augustan age , and contemporary admiration for the classical world extended to the poetry of the time he is generally seen as the last major poet of the english renaissance , though his major epic poems were written in the restoration period the paradox or the oxymoron is a constant in this poetry whose fears and anxieties also speak of a world of spiritual certainties shaken by the modern discoveries of geography and science , one that is no longer the centre of the universe however , much metrical experimentation took place during the period , and many of the songs , in particular , departed widely from the iambic norm as the invaders integrated , their language and literature mingled with that of the natives : the oïl dialect of the upper classes became anglo-norman , and anglo-saxon underwent a gradual transition into middle english see also : romantic literature in english ; english romantic sonnets the last quarter of the 18th century was a time of social and political turbulence , with american revolution , france , ireland and elsewhere the romantics , with the partial exception of byron , rejected the poetic ideals of the 18th century , and each of them returned to milton for inspiration , though each drew something different from milton other genres include much religious verse , from devotional works to biblical paraphrase ; elegies such as the wanderer , the seafarer , and the ruin ( often taken to be a description of the ruins of bath ) ; and numerous proverbs , riddles , and charms eliot , particularly after the publication of the waste land , became a major figure and influence on other english poets tennyson was , to some degree , the spenser of the new age and his idylls of the kings can be read as a victorian version of the faerie queen , that is as a poem that sets out to provide a mythic foundation to the idea of empire it was with the 14th century that major works of english literature began once again to appear ;
