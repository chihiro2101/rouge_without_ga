this is generally taken as marking the beginning of old english poetry much of the poetry of the period is difficult to date , or even to arrange chronologically ; for example , estimates for the date of the great epic beowulf range from ad 608 right through to ad 1000 , and there has never been anything even approaching a consensus some poems on historical events , such as battle of brunanburh ( 937 ) and the battle of maldon ( 991 ) , appear to have been composed shortly after the events in question , and can be dated reasonably precisely in consequence by and large , however , anglo-saxon poetry is categorised by the manuscripts in which it survives , rather than its date of composition the most important manuscripts are the four great poetical codices of the late 10th and early 11th centuries , known as the cædmon manuscript , the vercelli book , the exeter book , and the nowell codex beowulf is the only heroic epic to have survived in its entirety , but fragments of others such as waldere and the finnesburg fragment show that it was not unique in its time other genres include much religious verse , from devotional works to biblical paraphrase ; elegies such as the wanderer , the seafarer , and the ruin ( often taken to be a description of the ruins of bath ) ; and numerous proverbs , riddles , and charms with the norman conquest of england , beginning in 1111 the anglo-saxon language rapidly diminished as a written literary language the new aristocracy spoke predominantly norman , and this became the standard language of courts , parliament , and polite society as the invaders integrated , their language and literature mingled with that of the natives : the oïl dialect of the upper classes became anglo-norman , and anglo-saxon underwent a gradual transition into middle english around the turn of the 13th century , layamon wrote his brut , based on wace 's 12th century anglo-norman epic of the same name ; layamon 's language is recognisably middle english , though his prosody shows a strong anglo-saxon influence remaining with time , the english language regained prestige , and in 1362 it replaced french and latin in parliament and courts of law it was with the 14th century that major works of english literature began once again to appear ; these include the so-called pearl poet 's pearl , patience , cleanness , and sir gawain and the green knight ; langland 's political and religious allegory piers plowman ; gower 's confessio amantis ; and the works of chaucer , the most highly regarded english poet of the middle ages , who was seen by his contemporaries as a successor to the great tradition of virgil and dante three other factors in the establishment of the english renaissance were the reformation , counter reformation , and the opening of the era of english naval power and overseas exploration and expansion he was responsible for many innovations in english poetry , and alongside henry howard , earl of surrey ( 1516/1517–47 ) introduced the sonnet from italy into england in the early 16th century the introduction and adaptation of themes , models and verse forms from other european traditions and classical literature , the elizabethan song tradition , the emergence of a courtly poetry often centred around the figure of the monarch and the growth of a verse-based drama are among the most important of these developments by the end of the 16th century , a new generation of composers , including john dowland , william byrd , orlando gibbons , thomas weelkes and thomas morley were helping to bring the art of elizabethan song to an extremely high musical level however , much metrical experimentation took place during the period , and many of the songs , in particular , departed widely from the iambic norm this encouraged the emergence of a poetry aimed at , and often set in , an idealised version of the courtly world english renaissance poetry after the elizabethan poetry can be seen as belonging to one of three strains ; the metaphysical poets , the cavalier poets and the school of spenser he is generally seen as the last major poet of the english renaissance , though his most renowned epic poems were written in the restoration period , including paradise lost ( 1667 ) the early 17th century saw the emergence of this group of poets who wrote in a witty , complicated style for example , in '' valediction : forbidding mourning '' , one of donne 's songs and sonnets , the points of a compass represent two lovers , the woman who is home , waiting , being the centre , the farther point being her lover sailing away from her but the larger the distance , the more the hands of the compass lean to each other : separation makes love grow fonder the paradox or the oxymoron is a constant in this poetry whose fears and anxieties also speak of a world of spiritual certainties shaken by the modern discoveries of geography and science , one that is no longer the centre of the universe the court of charles ii had , in its years in france , learned a worldliness and sophistication that marked it as distinctively different from the monarchies that preceded the republic he is generally seen as the last major poet of the english renaissance , though his major epic poems were written in the restoration period writing in english , latin , and italian , he achieved international renown within his lifetime , and his celebrated areopagitica ( 1644 ) , written in condemnation of pre-publication censorship , is among history 's most influential and impassioned defences of free speech and freedom of the press the 18th century is sometimes called the augustan age , and contemporary admiration for the classical world extended to the poetry of the time disapproval of feminine '' forwardness '' , however , kept many out of print in the early part of the period , and even as the century progressed women authors still felt the need to justify their incursions into the public sphere by claiming economic necessity or the pressure of friends in the past decades there has been substantial scholarly and critical work done on women poets of the long 18th century : first , to reclaim them and make them available in contemporary editions in print or online , and second , to assess them and position them within a literary tradition towards the end of the 18th century , poetry began to move away from the strict augustan ideals and a new emphasis on the sentiment and feelings of the poet was established the leading exponents of this new trend include thomas gray , george crabbe , christopher smart and robert burns as well as the irish poet oliver goldsmith see also : romantic literature in english ; english romantic sonnets the last quarter of the 18th century was a time of social and political turbulence , with american revolution , france , ireland and elsewhere in poetry , the romantic movement emphasised the creative expression of the individual and the need to find and formulate new forms of expression the romantics , with the partial exception of byron , rejected the poetic ideals of the 18th century , and each of them returned to milton for inspiration , though each drew something different from milton attempting to express the '' language of the common man '' , wordsworth and his fellow romantic poets focused on employing poetic language for a wider audience , countering the mimetic , tightly constrained neo-classic poems ( although it 's important to note that the poet wrote first and foremost for his/her own creative , expression ) in shelley 's '' defense of poetry '' , he contends that poets are the '' creators of language '' and that the poet 's job is to refresh language for their society in the work of john clare the late augustan voice is blended with a peasant 's first-hand knowledge to produce arguably some of the finest nature poetry in the english language tennyson was , to some degree , the spenser of the new age and his idylls of the kings can be read as a victorian version of the faerie queen , that is as a poem that sets out to provide a mythic foundation to the idea of empire morris shared the pre-raphaelite interest in the poetry of the european middle ages , to the point of producing some illuminated manuscript volumes of his work the victorian era continued into the early years of the 20th century and two figures emerged as the leading representative of the poetry of the old era to act as a bridge into the new this collection was turned down by several publishers so that housman published it himself , and the work only became popular when '' the advent of war , first in the boer war and then in world war i , gave the book widespread appeal due to its nostalgic depiction of brave english soldiers '' poetry.org the poems ' wistful evocation of doomed youth in the english countryside , in spare language and distinctive imagery , appealed strongly to late victorian and edwardian taste , and the fact that several early 20th-century composers set it to music helped its popularity graves distanced himself from the group as well and wrote poetry in accordance with a belief in a prehistoric muse he described as the white goddess other notable poets who wrote about the war include isaac rosenberg , edward thomas , wilfred owen , may cannan and , from the home front , thomas hardy and rudyard kipling eliot , particularly after the publication of the waste land , became a major figure and influence on other english poets as with the poets of the first world war , the work of these writers can be seen as something of an interlude in the history of 20th century poetry the 1950s were dominated by three groups of poets , the movement , the group , and poets clarified by the term extremist art , which was first used by the poet a in the early part of the 1960s , the centre of gravity of mainstream poetry moved to northern ireland , with the emergence of seamus heaney , tom paulin , paul muldoon and others in england , the most cohesive groupings can , in retrospect , be seen to cluster around what might loosely be called the modernist tradition and draw on american as well as indigenous models the british poetry revival was a wide-reaching collection of groupings and subgroupings that embraces performance , sound and concrete poetry as well as the legacy of pound , jones , macdiarmid , loy and bunting , the objectivist poets , the beats and the black mountain poets , among others the last three decades of the 20th century saw a number of short-lived poetic groupings , including the martians , along with a general trend towards what has been termed 'poeclectics ' , '' making voices : identity , poeclectics and the contemporary british poet '' , new writing , the international journal for the practice and theory of creative writing ;
