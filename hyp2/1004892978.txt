unlike the other greek letters , this letter did not take its name from the phoenician letter from which it was derived ; it was given a new name on the pattern of beta , eta and theta the word zeta is the ancestor of zed , the name of the latin letter z in commonwealth english swedish and many romanic languages ( such as italian and spanish ) do not distinguish between the greek and roman forms of the letter ; '' zeta '' is used to refer to the roman letter z as well as the greek letter the letter ζ represents the voiced alveolar fricative in modern greek the modern pronunciation was , in all likelihood , established in the hellenistic age and may have already been a common practice in classical attic ; for example , it could count as one or two consonants metrically in attic drama , like the letter x in english , which is ( usually ) pronounced z initially but gz or ks elsewhere ( cf ) show a -ζζ- for ζ ; assuming that attic value was , it may be an attempt to transcribe a dialectal pronunciation ; the reverse can not be ruled completely , but a -σδ- transcription would have been more likely in this case the greek inscriptions almost never write ζ in words like or , so there must have been a difference between this sound and the sound of ( note , for example , that we write '' ads '' where the morphology is transparent , and '' adze '' where it is not , even though the pronunciation is the same , on the other hand , would have the same sequence of plosive and sibilant as the double letters of the ionic alphabet ψ and ξ , thereby avoiding a written plosive at the end of a syllable contra : the use of a special symbol for is no more or no less improbable than the use of ψ for and ξ for , or , for that matter , the later invention ϛ ( stigma ) for , which happens to be the voiceless counterpart of contra : a ) the sound development dz > dd is improbable ( mendez dosuna ) ; b ) ν has disappeared before ζ > δδ in laconian ( aristoph contra : a ) this may be a later development from or under the influence of italian ; b ) even if it is derived from an ancient , it may be a dialectal pronunciation zeta diaeta ) , and the greek ζ is continued by a romance affricate in the ending > italian contra : whether the pronunciation of was , or , di would probably still have been the closest native latin sound ; furthermore , the inscriptions are centuries later than the time for which is assumed is attested only in the lyric poetry of the greek isle of lesbos and the city-state of sparta during the archaic age and in bucolic poetry from the hellenistic age zeta has the numerical value 7 rather than 6 because the letter digamma ( also called 'stigma ' as a greek numeral ) was originally in the sixth position in the alphabet
