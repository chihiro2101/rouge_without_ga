list of common symptoms : '' sac-like '' appearance of the vocal folds hoarseness and deepening of the voice trouble speaking ( dysphonia ) reduced vocal range with diminished upper limits stretching of the mucosa ( distension ) shortness of breath ( dyspnoea ) reinke 's edema is characterized by a '' sac-like '' appearance of the vocal folds the low pitch voice is a direct result of increased fluid in the reinke 's space , which vibrates at a lower frequency than normal ( females hoarseness is a common problem of many larynx diseases , such as laryngitis the vocal cords consist of five layers of cells : squamous epithelium superficial lamina propria ( reinke 's space ) intermediate lamina propria deep lamina propria vocalis muscle in order for humans to produce sound for speech , the vocal folds must readily vibrate other complications of surgery include tissue scarring due to damage to the vocal ligament during the incision and vocal cord stiffening due to over-suctioning of the superficial lamina propria ( reinke 's space ) while smoking , gastric reflux , and vocal abuse have been more widely agreed upon in literature as risk factors for reinke 's edema , the altered bacterial cultures could be developed as a diagnostic tool in the future the progression of reinke 's edema is gradual and is directly related to the duration of exposure to risk factors , such as smoking and gastric reflux once the patient 's history is reviewed , the vocal cords will be visualized using laryngoscopy , a technique in which a tube with a camera ( endoscopy ) is passed through the nose and down the larynx the pathophysiology or mechanism of reinke 's edema is not well known , however , chemicals contained within cigarette smoke are associated with an increased vascular permeability of blood vessels , which results in fluid leaking into the reinke 's space this is true for other risk factors as well , such as untreated gastric reflux and overuse of the voice , which is common to professions such as singers and radio announcers flexible laryngoscopes , such as fiber laryngoscopes , allow the patient to produce sound as the tube is placed , and therefore allows the doctor to visualize movement of the vocal cord yonekawa classification : grade i – lesions contact the anterior third of the vocal fold grade ii – lesions contact the anterior two-thirds of the vocal fold grade iii – lesions contact the entirety of the vocal fold if further evaluation is needed , stroboscope is used to examine mucosal waves of the vocal cords the complication associated with removing tissue from both sides in a single surgery is that the raw , cut ends of the vocal cords may form an anterior glottis web , in which the two sides grow together in a continuous sheet while smoking is a clear risk factor to reinke 's edema , other risk factors are being identified to explain reinke 's edema in nonsmokers the “ pale ” type of reinke 's edema is defined by a glazed appearance of the vocal cords with a clear ( colorless ) fluid underneath additionally , individuals in professions that require constant use of the voice , such as singers , teachers , and radio hosts , may be at an increased risk for developing the disease in the case of smoking , as long as the individual continues the habit of smoking , the reinke 's edema will continue to progress the polyps of reinke 's edema are usually benign , however , there may be a risk of cancer if the patient is a smoker because males have lower pitched voices than females , males are less likely to observe a significant changes in the voice , and are therefore less likely to seek treatment this includes the cessation of smoking , the control of gastric reflux using antacids and/or proton pump inhibitors ( ppis ) , and the discontinuation of activities that cause vocal distress the swelling of the vocal cords and the lowering of the voice are warning signs that an individual has reinke 's edema accumulation of fluid within the reinke 's space alters the elasticity of the vocal cord , making it less stiff and more gelatinous due to the importance of the reinke 's space in speech , it is important that minimally invasive techniques be perfected that minimize the risk of complications
