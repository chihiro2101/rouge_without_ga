baianos and a cor do som ) mixed the genre with traditional brazilian music ( portuguese ) with the impoverishment of the mines at the end of the century , the focus of the musical activity changed to other centers , specially rio de janeiro and são paulo , where andré da silva gomes , a composer of portuguese origin , released a great number of works and dynamized the musical life of the city as a reaction against the nationalist school , who was identified as '' servile '' to the centralizing politics of getúlio vargas , in 1939 the movimento música viva ( living music movement ) appeared , led by hans joachim koellreutter and by egídio de castro e silva , defending the adoption of an international style , derived from the dodecaphonism of arnold schoenberg in the 1990s , the meteoric

introduced to the rest of the world by american jazz musicians in the early 1960s , and song '' the girl from ipanema '' remains probably the best known brazilian musical export , eventually becoming a jazz standard the genre went public with great impact in the 80s , with songs like feira de acari by mc batata , with furacão 2000 , mc marlboro and brazilian versions of freestyle songs by the singer latino , later turning into a more aggressive song , with an apology for violence , drugs , weapons and promiscuity in the 1990s , with precarious lyrics and several mcs with direct links with drug trafficking the king john vi of portugal brought with him to brazil the great musical library from the house of bragança , one of the best of europe at that time , and ordered the arrival of

ghetto , with bands capturing the attention of international critics , but many playing again in brazil when they become popular in the exterior , due to the lack of financial and material support which would allow for careers to be developed in the beginning , the success of choro came from informal groups of friends which played in parties , pubs ( botecos ) , streets , home balls ( forrobodós ) , and also the musical scores published by print houses the real commercial boom of brazilian rock was in the 1980s , with many bands and artists like blitz , gang 90 , barão vermelho ,
