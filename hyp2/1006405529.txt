the founders of the nation were three young men – two catholics and one protestant – who , according to the historian of the newspaper t o'sullivan , were all '' free from the slightest taint of bigotry , and were anxious to unite all creeds and classes for the country 's welfare all three were members of daniel o'connell 's repeal association , which sought repeal of the 1800 act of union between ireland and britain ; this association would later be known as young ireland.the name suggested by duffy for the paper was the national , but davis disagreed , suggesting '' that the use of an adjective for such a purpose was contrary to the analogies of the english language '' 1945 pg 42 '' we desired to make ireland a nation '' , duffy wrote , '' and the name would be a fitting prelude to the attempt in due course and after many other consultations between the founders , the following announcement was made as to the date of publication , the name of the journal , and the contributors : 1945 pg 43 on the first saturday in october will be published the first number of a ; dublin weekly journal to be called the nation , for which the services of the most eminent political writers in the country have been secured the paper was first published on saturday 15 october 1842 in the prospectus , which was written by davis with the exception of one sentence , it was stated , life of john mitchel , p the necessities of the country seem to demand a journal able to aid and organise the new movements going on amongst us—to make their growth deeper , and their fruit 'more racy of the soil'— and , above all , to direct the popular mind and the sympathies of educated men of all parties to the great end of nationality such a journal should be free from the quarrels , the interests , the wrongs , and even the gratitude of the past holding these views , the projectors of the nation can not think that a journal , prepared to undertake this work , will be deemed superfluous ; and as they labour , not for themselves but for their country , they are prepared , if they do not find a way open , to try if they can not make one as could be seen from the prospectus , as political objectives went , the programme was certain to be of immense assistance to daniel o'connell in his efforts to revive the agitation for repeal , young ireland and 1848 , dennis gwynn , cork university press 1949 , pg 8 but o'connell also knew and felt that he was receiving , for the present , a powerful support from them ; but he knew also , that they were outside of his influence , and did not implicitly believe that repeal would be yielded to '' agitator '' ; that they were continually seeking , by their writings , to arouse a military spirit among the people ; showing plainly , that while they helped the repeal association , they fully expected that the liberties of the country must be fought for in the end : it was in appearance only that they worked in harmony , ltd 1908 , pg 11 john mitchel joined the staff of the nation in the autumn of 1845 on mitchel 's frequent trips from banbridge , co down to dublin , he had come in contact with the repeal members who gathered about the nation office and in the spring of 1843 he became a member of the repeal association mitchel resigned his position as leader writer on the nation , he himself wrote years afterwards , because he came to regard as '' absolutely necessary a more vigorous policy against the english government than that which william smith o'brien , charles gavan duffy and other young ireland leaders were willing to pursue '' in 1847 , when he severed his connection with the nation , he wrote , '' i had watched the progress of the famine policy of the government , and could see nothing in it but a machinery , deliberately devised , and skillfully worked , for the entire subjugation of the island—the slaughter of portion of the people , and the pauperization of the rest '' , and he had therefore '' come to the conclusion that the whole system ought to be met with resistance at every point , and the means for this would be extremely simple , namely , a combination among the people to obstruct and render impossible the transport and shipment of irish provisions ; to refuse all aid to its removal ; to destroy the highways ; to prevent everyone , by intimidation , from daring to bid for grain and cattle if brought to auction under 'distress ' ( a method of obstruction which put an end to church tithes before ) ; in short , to offer a passive resistance universally ; but occasionally , when opportunity served , to try the steel duffy , the proprietor of the nation , mitchel therefore resigned from the journal , and started his own paper , the united irishman women wrote for the paper , and published under pseudonyms such as mary ( ellen mary patrick downing ) ; speranza ( jane elgee , lady wilde , oscar wilde 's mother ) , known universally as '' speranza '' of the nation ; and eva ( mary eva kelly , who would marry kevin izod o'doherty ) the role played by some of its key figures in the paper in the ill-fated young irelander rebellion of 1848 cemented the paper 's reputation as the voice of irish radicalism he fled ireland , escaping first to france and , eventually , to the united states , where he served the new york bar the nation continued to be published until 1900 , when it merged with the irish weekly independent comerford , wolfhound press 1998 william smith o'brien and the young ireland rebellion of 1848 , robert sloan , four courts press 2000 irish mitchel , seamus maccall , thomas nelson and sons ltd 1938
