because lotharingia lacked a single historic or ethnic identity , contemporaries were unsure what to call it and so it became regnum quondam lotharii or regnum lotharii ( '' kingdom once lothair 's '' ) and its inhabitants lotharii ( from lotharius ) , lotharienses ( from lothariensis ) , or lotharingi ( which gives the modern dutch , german , and luxembourgish names for the province lotharingen , lothringen , and lothringen respectively ) the latter term , formed with the germanic suffix -ing , indicating ancestral or familial relationships , gave rise to the latin term lotharingia ( from the latin suffix -ia , indicating a country ) in the tenth century the logic of the division was that lothair had the crown of kingdom of italy , which had been his subkingdom under louis the pious , and that as emperor he should rule in aachen , the capital of the first carolingian emperor , charlemagne , and in rome , the ancient capital of emperors in 855 , when lothair i was dying in prüm abbey , he divided his kingdom between his three sons with the treaty of prüm his uncles , king of east francia louis the german and west francia charles the bald ( who wanted to rule the whole of lotharingia ) agreed to divide lotharingia between them with the 870 treaty of meerssen - the western half went to west francia and the eastern half to east francia in 879 , louis 's son , king louis the younger , was invited by a faction of the west frankish nobility to succeed king louis the stammerer , charles 's son , on the throne of west francia in november 887 , arnulf of carinthia called a council of east frankish nobility to depose emperor charles the fat , who by 884 had succeeded to the thrones of all the kingdoms of the empire the rule of arnulf in east francia was initially opposed by guy iii of spoleto , who became king of italy , and by rudolph i of burgundy , who was elected king in the southern half of former middle francia - upper burgundy when non-carolingian conrad i of germany was elected king of east francia in 911 , lotharingian nobles under the new duke reginar voted to attach their duchy to west francia , still ruled by the carolingian dynasty the carolingians : a family who forged europe in 944 , west francia invaded lotharingia , but retreated after otto i responded with mobilization of a large army under herman i , duke of swabia in 953 , duke conrad rebelled against otto i , was removed from power and replaced by otto 's brother bruno the great who finally pacified lotharingia in 959 by dividing it in duchy of lorraine ( upper lorraine or southern lorraine ) under frederick i and lower lorraine ( lower lotharingia , lower lorraine or northern lotharingia ) under godfrey i in 978 , king lothair of west francia invaded the region and captured aachen , but otto ii , holy roman emperor , counterattacked and reached the walls of paris in the twelfth century the ducal authority in lower lotharingia ( or lower lorraine ) fragmented , causing the formation of the duchy of limburg and the duchy of brabant , whose rulers retained the title duke of lothier ( derived from '' lotharingia '' ) after centuries of french invasions and occupations , lorraine was finally ceded to france at the close of the war of the polish succession ( 1737 ) in 1871 , after the franco-prussian war , the northern portions of lorraine were merged with alsace to become the province of alsace-lorraine in the german empire neal ascherson , '' a mess of tiny principalities '' ( review of simon winder , lotharingia : a personal history of europe 's lost country , farrar , straus , and giroux , 2019 , 504 pp
