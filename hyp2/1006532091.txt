it was later determined that a bolt vent axial ( bva ) seal assembly had been removed during an earlier exercise and had yet to be replaced at the time of the incident , thus allowing explosive gases to enter the turret space ; the lack of a written process for removal and replacement of the seal assembly meant that the crew at the time of the incident was unaware of its absence , and it was also noted that inadequate consideration had been given during the production of the l30 gun as to whether it could be fired without the seal assembly in order to maintain the effectiveness of the thermal imaging system prior to the award and implementation of the cr2 lep , an interim £15.4 million '' challenger 2 thermal imaging sustainment project '' was awarded to bae systems on 15 december 2017 to '' demonstrate and manufacture '' a suitable interim solution separate to that incorporated in the lep in october 2020 , the mod argued that the challenger 2 lep was a better course of action than purchasing similar tanks in nato armies , and that the upgraded challenger 2 would be '' comparable – and in certain areas superior '' to the leopard 2 and abrams this means that the challenger 2 now has available new tungsten '' fin '' ( apfsds ) and hesh rounds , if and when required , which secures a line of ammunition for its 55 calibre rifled main gun , the l30 , when required in the future active protection systems ( aps ) for armoured vehicles in the uk armed forces ( including the challenger 2 ) are being assessed by the uk defence science and technical laboratory ( dstl ) as part of the medusa technical assessment programme , this includes the muss system the size and performance are similar to the mbt , but instead of armament it is fitted with : a main winch with 50 tonnes-force pull in a 1:1 configuration or 98 tonnes-force pull using an included pulley in a 2:1 configuration and anchor point on the vehicle , plus a small auxiliary winch to aid in deploying the main winch rope around this time a separate two-year contract was awarded to bae systems and krauss maffei wegmann to develop an update to the bridging variant in part to address the increase in weight of the challenger 2 from 64t to 75t arising from upgrades made during the iraq campaign the challenger armoured repair and recovery vehicle ( crarrv ) is an armoured recovery vehicle based on the challenger 1 hull ( with the updated challenger 2 powertrain ) and designed to repair and recover damaged tanks on the battlefield in january 2016 it was reported by ihs jane 's that the uk 's defence equipment and support ( de & s ) organisation had received a number of replies to its pre-qualification questionnaire ( pqq ) for the projected challenger 2 lep haaip has already led to upgrades to the air filtration system , through the use of cleanable air filters with increased operating life , which were tested in exercise saif sareea 3 in october 2018 in addition , several challenger 2s had the pintle-mounted gpmg on the loader 's crew hatch replaced with a remote controlled turret , allowing the loader to operate the weaponry without having to expose himself to enemy fire the challenger 2 life extension programme ( lep ) is designed to replace obsolete equipment , enhance protection , increase range and provide improved lethality of the tank until an out of service date of 2035 - extending its life from 2025 the lep will see the replacement of most of the tanks electronics , including its sighting systems but does not envisage a major upgrade of the vehicle 's drive systems or replacement of the 120 & nbsp ; mm l30a1 rifled gun the full scope of the lep is indicated as being broken down into four areas : surveillance and target acquisition : updated commanders primary sight , updated gunners primary sight , replacement thermal observation and gunnery sights ( togs ) and , 3rd generation thermal imaging ( ti ) a second explosion that occurred during the incident was attributed to the detonation of bag charges that had been stowed outside of the internal ammunition bins ( rather than inside the bins as per correct procedure ) . a royal tank regiment ( rtr ) newsletter dated december 2015 stated that the lep includes managing to curb obsolescence in several turret systems – including ti sights , the fire control computer ( fcc ) and electronic architecture in turret improved technology will be integrated as a new system on the platform , which will deliver more accurate engagements at range and improved fcc power , meaning that cr2 will remain a '' battle winning '' asset out to the extended out of service date in addition to bae systems combat vehicles ( uk ) , which is the original manufacturer , contenders were stated to include rheinmetall and krauss-maffei wegmann of germany , general dynamics uk , lockheed martin uk , cmi defence of belgium , and ruag defence of switzerland weapon control system : fire control computer ( fcc ) , fire control panel ( fcp ) and , gun processing unit ( gpu ) mobility ( through in-service efficiencies ) : 3rd generation ( horstman ) hydrogas suspension , improved air filtration , cv-12 common rail fuel injection , transmission and , cooling
