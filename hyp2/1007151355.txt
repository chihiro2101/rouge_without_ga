as the intent of an emergency action notification is to serve as a '' last-ditch effort to get a message out if the president can not get to the media '' , it can easily be made redundant by the 24-hour news cycle that major weather events and other newsworthy situations—such as , most prominently , the september 11 attacks in 2001—receive from television broadcasters and news channels this was accomplished via expansions to the aforementioned pep network , and the development of the integrated public alert and warning system ( ipaws ) —a national aggregator and distributor of alert information using the xml-based common alerting protocol ( cap ) and an internet network broadcasters traditionally have been allowed to opt out of relaying other alerts such as severe weather , and child abduction emergencies ( amber alerts ) if they so choose ( in practice , severe weather coverage is usually handled by a station 's local news operation and on-air meteorologists , rather than processed through eas ) in 2004 , the fcc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking ( npr ) seeking comment on whether eas in its present form is the most effective mechanism for warning the american public of an emergency and , if not , on how eas can be improved , such as mandatory text messages to cellphones , regardless of subscription on february 3 , 2011 , the fcc announced plans and procedures for national eas tests , which involve all television and radio stations connected to the eas , as well as all cable and satellite services in the united states glenn collins of the new york times acknowledged these limitations , noting that '' no president has ever used the current eas system or its technical predecessors in the last 50 years , despite the cold war , a presidential assassination , the oklahoma city bombing , major earthquakes and three recent high-alert terrorist warnings '' , and that using it would have actually hindered the availability of live coverage from media outlets to protect the integrity of the system , and prevent false activations , the fcc prohibits the use of actual or simulated eas/wea tones and attention signals outside of genuine alerts , tests , or authorized public service announcements , especially when they are used '' to capture audience attention during advertisements ;
