the first known practical sensitometry , which allowed measurements of the speed of photographic materials , was invented by the polish engineer leon warnerke – pseudonym of ( 1837–1900 ) – in 1880 , among the achievements for which he was awarded the progress medal of the photographic society of great britain in 1882 the warnerke standard sensitometer consisted of a frame holding an opaque screen with an array of typically 25 numbered , gradually pigmented squares brought into contact with the photographic plate during a timed test exposure under a phosphorescent tablet excited before by the light of a burning magnesium ribbon the speed of the emulsion was then expressed in 'degrees ' warnerke ( sometimes seen as warn ) corresponding with the last number visible on the exposed plate after development and fixation each number represented an increase of 1/3 in speed , typical plate speeds were between 10° and 25° warnerke at the time his system saw some success but proved to be unreliable due to its spectral sensitivity to light , the fading intensity of the light emitted by the phosphorescent tablet after its excitation as well as high built-tolerances the concept , however , was later built upon in 1900 by henry chapman jones ( 1855–1932 ) plate tester and modified speed system another early practical system for measuring the sensitivity of an emulsion was that of hurter and driffield ( h & d ) , originally described in 1890 , by the swiss-born ferdinand hurter ( 1844–1898 ) and british vero charles driffield ( 1848–1915 ) in their system , speed numbers were inversely proportional to the exposure required the methods to determine the sensitivity were later modified in 1925 ( in regard to the light source used ) and in 1928 ( regarding light source , developer and proportional factor ) —this later variant was sometimes called '' h & d 10 '' the h & d system was officially accepted as a standard in the former soviet union from 1928 until september 1951 , when it was superseded by gost 2817–50 ) system was devised by the german astronomer julius scheiner ( 1858–1913 ) in 1894 originally as a method of comparing the speeds of plates used for astronomical photography scheiner 's system rated the speed of a plate by the least exposure to produce a visible darkening upon development iso 12232:1998 ( 1998-08 ) , iso 12232:2006 ( 2006-04-15 ) , iso 12232:2006 ( 2006-10-01 ) , iso 12232:2019 ( 2019-02-01 ) photography — digital still cameras — determination of exposure index , iso speed ratings , standard output sensitivity , and recommended exposure index speed of photographic negative materials ( monochrome , continuous tone , method for determining ) photography — black-and-white pictorial still camera negative film/process systems — determination of iso speed ( same as ansi/iso 6-1993 ) photography ( sensitometry ) color reversal camera films – determination of iso speed asa ph2.27-1965 ( 1965-07-06 ) , asa ph2.27-1971 , asa ph2.27-1976 , ansi ph2.27-1979 , ansi ph2.27-1981 , ansi ph2.27-1988 ( 1988-08-04 ) photography – colour negative films for still photography – determination of iso speed ( withdrawn ) photographic sensitometry ; systems of black and white negative films and their process for pictorial photography ; determination of speed photographic sensitometry ; determination of the speed of colour reversal films photographic sensitometry ; determination of the speed of colour negative films photography – black-and-white pictorial still camera negative film/process systems – determination of iso speed ( iso 6:1993 ) photography – colour reversal camera films – determination of iso speed ( iso 2240:2003 ) photography – colour negative films for still photography – determination of iso speed ( iso 5800:1987 + corr what is the meaning of iso for digital cameras ? digital photography faq signal-dependent noise modeling , estimation , and removal for digital imaging sensors
