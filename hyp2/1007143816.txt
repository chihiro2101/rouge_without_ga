each service description includes a list of the commands , or actions , to which the service responds , and parameters , or arguments , for each action ; the description for a service also includes a list of variables ; these variables model the state of the service at run time , and are described in terms of their data type , range , and event characteristics it assumes the network must run internet protocol ( ip ) and then leverages http , soap and xml on top of ip , in order to provide device/service description , actions , data transfer and eventing upnp av architecture is an audio and video extension of the upnp , supporting a variety of devices such as tvs , vcrs , cd/dvd players/jukeboxes , settop boxes , stereos systems , mp3 players , still image cameras , camcorders , electronic picture frames ( epfs ) , and personal computers for the control point to learn more about the device and its capabilities , or to interact with the device , the control point must retrieve the device 's description from the location ( url ) provided by the device in the discovery message other upnp features include : ; media and device independence : upnp technology can run on many media that support ip including ethernet , firewire , ir ( irda ) , home wiring ( g.hn ) and rf ( bluetooth , wi-fi ) therefore , all subscribers are sent all event messages , subscribers receive event messages for all '' evented '' variables that have changed , and event messages are sent no matter why the state variable changed ( either in response to a requested action or because the state the service is modeling changed ) the upnp av architecture allows devices to support different types of formats for the entertainment content , including mpeg2 , mpeg4 , jpeg , mp3 , windows media audio ( wma ) , bitmaps ( bmp ) , and ntsc , pal or atsc formats ocf had published a fix to the protocol specification in april 2020 , but since many devices running upnp are not easily upgradable , callstranger is likely to remain a threat for a long time to come device search requests and advertisements are supported by running http on top of udp using multicast ( known as httpmu ) responses to search requests are also sent over udp , but are instead sent using unicast ( known as httpu ) in addition to combining services defined by upnp forum in various ways , vendors can define their own device and service types , and can extend standard devices and services with vendor-defined actions , state variables , data structure elements , and variable values many routers and firewalls expose themselves as internet gateway devices , allowing any local upnp control point to perform a variety of actions , including retrieving the external ip address of the device , enumerating existing port mappings , and adding or removing port mappings if a device has a url for presentation , then the control point can retrieve a page from this url , load the page into a web browser , and depending on the capabilities of the page , allow a user to control the device and/or view device status when a control point is added to the network , ssdp allows that control point to actively search for devices of interest on the network or listen passively to the ssdp alive messages of device the fundamental exchange is a discovery message containing a few essential specifics about the device or one of its services , for example , its type , identifier , and a pointer ( network location ) to more detailed information comparison of upnp av media servers devices profile for web services digital living network alliance ( dlna ) list of upnp av media servers and clients port control protocol nat port mapping protocol ( nat-pmp ) internet gateway device protocol port ( computer networking ) zeroconf a upnp compatible device from any vendor can dynamically join a network , obtain an ip address , announce its name , advertise or convey its capabilities upon request , and learn about the presence and capabilities of other devices upnp av media servers provide a service to upnp av client devices , so-called control points , for browsing the media content of the server and request the media server to deliver a file to the control point for playback in february 2013 , the upnp forum responded in a press release by recommending more recent versions of the used upnp stacks , and by improving the certification program to include checks to avoid further such issues quality of service refers to control mechanisms that can provide different priority to different users or data flows , or guarantee a certain level of performance to a data flow in accordance with requests from the application program dubbed '' callstranger '' by its discoverer , it allows an attacker to subvert the event subscription mechanism and execute a variety of attacks : amplification of requests for use in ddos ; enumeration ; and data exfiltration richard : service and device discovery : protocols and programming , mcgraw-hill professional , michael jeronimo , jack weast : upnp design by example : a software developer 's guide to universal plug and play , intel press , if during the dhcp transaction , the device obtains a domain name , for example , through a dns server or via dns forwarding , the device should use that name in subsequent network operations ; otherwise , the device should use its ip address it is a distributed , open architecture protocol based on established standards such as the internet protocol suite ( tcp/ip ) , http , xml , and soap this requires specific version of adobe flash with acknowledged security issues ) are capable of generating a specific type of http request which allows a router implementing the upnp igd protocol to be controlled by a malicious web site when someone with a upnp-enabled router simply visits that web site also , not all routers can have such things as dns server settings altered by upnp because much of the specification ( including lan host configuration ) is optional for upnp enabled routers
