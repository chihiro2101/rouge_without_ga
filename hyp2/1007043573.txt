of those who do develop symptoms , the primary infection is most often respiratory , with symptoms resembling bronchitis or pneumonia that resolve over a matter of a few weeks notable coccidioidomycosis signs and symptoms include a profound fatigue ( medical ) , loss of smell and taste , fever , cough , headaches , rash , myalgia , and arthralgia the classic triad of coccidioidomycosis known as '' desert rheumatism '' includes the combination of fever , joint pains , and erythema nodosum therefore , coccidioidomycosis may be divided into the following types : : acute coccidioidomycosis , sometimes described in literature as primary pulmonary coccidioidomycosis : chronic coccidioidomycosis : disseminated coccidioidomycosis , which includes primary cutaneous coccidioidomycosis serious complications may occur in patients who have weakened immune systems , including severe pneumonia with respiratory failure and bronchopleural fistulas requiring resection , lung nodules , and possible disseminated form , where the infection spreads throughout the body the disseminated form of coccidioidomycosis can devastate the body , causing skin ulcers , abscesses , bone lesions , swollen joints with severe pain , heart inflammation , urinary tract problems , and meningitis , which can lead to death preventing valley fever is challenging because it is difficult to avoid breathing in the fungus should it be present ; however , the public health effect of the disease is essential to understand in areas where the fungus is endemic studies done in the past show that the cost benefit of a vaccine is most notable among infants , teens , and immigrant adults , with negative cost-benefit results among older age groups dust control measures such as planting grass and wetting the soil , and also limiting exposure to dust storms are advisable for residential areas in endemic regions because the symptoms of coccidioidomycosis are similar to the common flu , pneumonia , and other respiratory diseases , it is important for public health professionals to be aware of the rise of coccidioidomycosis and the specifics of diagnosis amb colloidal versus amb deoxycholate : researchgate ; antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy 35 ( 9 ) :1829-33 · october 1991 ( printed from pubmed ) - retrieved 2017-01-17 the cost of amb deoxycholate , in 2015 , for a patient of at 1 & nbsp ; mg/kg/day dosage , was approximately 63.80 , compared to 5 & nbsp ; mg/kg/day of liposomal amb at 1318.80 , making the less toxic option less accessible in harmony with the mycelium life cycle , incidence increases with periods of dryness after a rainy season ; this phenomenon , termed '' grow and blow '' , refers to growth of the fungus in wet weather , producing spores which are spread by the wind during succeeding dry weather while the majority of cases are observed in the endemic region , cases reported outside the area are generally visitors , who contact the infection and return to their native areas before becoming symptomatic immitis is endemic to southern and central california with the highest presence in the san joaquin valley posadassi is most prevalent in arizona , although it can be found in a wider region spanning from utah , new mexico , texas , and nevada in arizona , for instance , in 2007 , there were 3,450 cases in maricopa county , which in 2007 had an estimated population of 3,880,181 u.s in contrast , though southern new mexico is considered an endemic region , there were 35 cases in the entire state in 2008 and 23 in 2007 , in a region that had an estimated 2008 population of 1,984,356 , new mexico intercensal population estimates from the u.s in addition , the effect of altitude on fungi growth and morphology has not been studied , and altitude can range from sea level to 10,000 feet or higher across california , arizona , utah and new mexico the highest incidence was in the san joaquin valley with 76 % of the 16,970 cases ( 12,855 ) occurring in the area following the 1994 northridge earthquake , there was a sudden increase of cases in the areas affected by the quake , at a pace of over 10 times baseline in 2005 and 2006 , the pleasant valley state prison near coalinga and avenal state prison near avenal on the western side of the san joaquin valley had the highest incidence in 2005 , of at least 3,000 per 100,000 william ophüls , a professor at stanford university hospital ( san francisco ) , discovered that the causative agent of the disease that was at first called coccidioides infection and later coccidioidomycosis was a fungal pathogen , and coccidioidomycosis was also distinguished from histoplasmosis and blastomycosis further , coccidioides immitis was identified as the culprit of respiratory disorders previously called san joaquin valley fever , desert fever , and valley fever , and a serum precipitin test was developed by charles e in retrospect , smith played a major role in both medical research and raising awareness about coccidioidomycosis , especially when he became dean of the school of public health at the university of california at berkeley in 1951 medical research suggested that oc might have had some lethal effects on the populace , and coccidioides immitis started to be classified by the authorities as a threat to public health however , coccidioides immitis was never weaponized to the public 's knowledge , and most of the military research in the mid-1960s was concentrated on developing a human vaccine in 2002 , coccidioides posadasii was identified as genetically distinct from coccidioides immitis despite their morphologic similarities and can also cause coccidioidomycosis as of 2013 , there is no vaccine available to prevent infection with coccidioides immitis or coccidioides posadasii , but efforts to develop such a vaccine are underway in dogs , the most common symptom of coccidioidomycosis is a chronic cough , which can be dry or moist in cats , symptoms may include skin lesions , fever , and loss of appetite , with skin lesions being the most common other species in which valley fever has been found include livestock such as cattle and horses ; llamas ; marine mammals , including sea otters ; zoo animals such as monkeys and apes , kangaroos , tigers , etc ; and wildlife native to the geographic area where the fungus is found , such as cougars , skunks , and javelinas coccidioides coccidioides immitis coccidioides posadasii zygomycosis medical geology list of cutaneous conditions thunderhead , a 1998 novel by douglas preston and lincoln child which uses the fungus and illness as a central plot point
