this lasts from 24 to 36 hours , and results in the rupture of the ovarian follicles , causing the oocyte to be released from the ovary after this is done , a hole called the stigma will form in the follicle , and the secondary oocyte will leave the follicle through this hole the process of ovulation is controlled by the hypothalamus of the brain and through the release of hormones secreted in the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland , luteinizing hormone ( lh ) and follicle-stimulating hormone ( fsh ) the secondary oocyte leaves the ruptured follicle and moves out into the peritoneal cavity through the stigma , where it is caught by the fimbriae at the end of the fallopian tube the time from the beginning of the last menstrual period ( lmp ) until ovulation is , on average , 14.6 days , but with substantial variation among females and between cycles in any single female , with an overall 95 % prediction interval of 8.2 to 20.5 days during the luteal phase , the secondary oocyte will travel through the fallopian tubes toward the uterus in the preovulatory phase of the menstrual cycle , the ovarian follicle will undergo a series of transformations called cumulus expansion , which is stimulated by fsh disorders of ovulation are classified as menstrual disorders and include oligoovulation and anovulation : oligoovulation is infrequent or irregular ovulation ( usually defined as cycles of greater than 36 days or fewer than 8 cycles a year ) anovulation is absence of ovulation when it would be normally expected ( in a post-menarche , premenopausal female ) the follicular phase ( or proliferative phase ) is the phase of the menstrual cycle during which the ovarian follicles mature by this time , the oocyte has completed meiosis , yielding two cells : the larger ovum that contains all of the cytoplasmic material and a smaller , inactive first polar body through a signal transduction cascade initiated by lh , which activates the pro-inflammatory genes through ampc secondary messenger , peptidase are secreted by the follicle that degrade the follicular tissue at the site of the blister , forming a hole called the stigma furthermore , many females experience secondary fertility signs including mittelschmerz ( pain associated with ovulation ) and a heightened sense of smell , and can sense the precise moment of ovulation the charting of such symptoms & mdash ; primarily basal body temperature , mittelschmerz and cervical position & mdash ; is referred to as the sympto-thermal method of fertility awareness , which allow auto-diagnosis by a female of her state of ovulation
