pietism did not die out in the 18th century , but was alive and active in the american deutscher evangelischer kirchenverein des westens ( german evangelical church society of the west , based in gravois , later german evangelical synod of north america and still later the evangelical and reformed church , a precursor of the united church of christ this movement focused on a reassertion of the identity of lutherans as a distinct group within the broader community of christians , with a renewed focus on the book of concord as a key source of lutheran doctrine heppe and ritschl – have included under it nearly all religious tendencies amongst protestants of the last three centuries in the direction of a more serious cultivation of personal piety than that prevalent in the various established churches some historians also speak of a later or modern pietism , characterizing thereby a party in the german church probably influenced by remains of spener 's pietism in westphalia , on the rhine , in württemberg , halle upon saale , and berlin pietist belief in the power of individual meditation on the divine – a direct , individual approach to the ultimate spiritual reality of god – was probably partly responsible for the uniquely metaphysical , idealistic nature of german romantic philosophy laestadian lutheranism , a form of pietistic lutheranism , continues to flourish in scandinavia , where church of sweden priest lars levi laestadius spearheaded the revival in the 19th century amongst them were the christian mystic jakob böhme ( behmen ) ; johann arndt , whose work , true christianity , became widely known and appreciated ; heinrich müller , who described the font , the pulpit , the confessional , and the altar as '' the four dumb idols of the lutheran church '' ; the theologian johann valentin andrea , court chaplain of the landgrave of hesse ; schuppius , who sought to restore the bible to its place in the pulpit ; and theophil großgebauer ( d born at rappoltsweiler in alsace , now in france , on 13 january 1635 , trained by a devout godmother who used books of devotion like arndt 's true christianity , spener was convinced of the necessity of a moral and religious reformation within german lutheranism he afterwards spent a year in geneva , and was powerfully influenced by the strict moral life and rigid ecclesiastical discipline prevalent there , and also by the preaching and the piety of the waldensian professor antoine leger and the converted jesuit preacher jean de labadie during a stay in tübingen , spener read grossgebauer 's alarm cry , and in 1666 he entered upon his first pastoral charge at frankfurt with a profound opinion that the christian life within evangelical lutheranism was being sacrificed to zeal for rigid lutheran orthodoxy pietism , as a distinct movement in the german church , began with religious meetings at spener 's house ( collegia pietatis ) where he repeated his sermons , expounded passages of the new testament , and induced those present to join in conversation on religious questions this was originally a pejorative term given to the adherents of the movement by its enemies as a form of ridicule , like that of '' methodists '' somewhat later in england in pia desideria , spener made six proposals as the best means of restoring the life of the church : the earnest and thorough study of the bible in private meetings , ecclesiolae in ecclesia ( '' little churches within the church '' ) the christian priesthood being universal , the laity should share in the spiritual government of the church a knowledge of christianity must be attended by the practice of it as its indispensable sign and supplement instead of merely didactic , and often bitter , attacks on the heterodox and unbelievers , a sympathetic and kindly treatment of them a reorganization of the theological training of the universities , giving more prominence to the devotional life a different style of preaching , namely , in the place of pleasing rhetoric , the implanting of christianity in the inner or new man , the soul of which is faith , and its effects the fruits of life this work produced a great impression throughout germany three magistrates belonging to that society , one of whom was august hermann francke , subsequently the founder of the famous orphanage at halle ( 1695 ) , commenced courses of expository lectures on the scriptures of a practical and devotional character , and in the german language , which were zealously frequented by both students and townsmen the lectures , however , aroused the ill-will of the other theologians and pastors of leipzig , and francke and his friends left the city , and with the aid of christian thomasius and spener founded the new university of halle spener died in 1705 , but the movement , guided by francke and fertilized from halle , spread through the whole of middle and north germany among its greatest achievements , apart from the philanthropic institutions founded at halle , were the revival of the moravian church in 1727 by count von zinzendorf , spener 's godson and a pupil in the halle school for young noblemen , and the establishment of protestant missions authorities within state-endorsed churches were suspicious of pietist doctrine which they often viewed as a social danger , as it '' seemed either to generate an excess of evangelical fervor and so disturb the public tranquility or to promote a mysticism so nebulous as to obscure the imperatives of morality while some pietists ( such as francis magny ) held that '' mysticism and the moral law went together '' , for others ( like his pupil françoise-louise de la tour ) '' pietist mysticism did less to reinforce the moral law than to take its place… the principle of 'guidance by inner light ' was often a signal to follow the most intense of her inner sentiments… the supremacy of feeling over reason '' as a distinct movement , pietism had its greatest strength by the middle of the 18th century ; its very individualism in fact helped to prepare the way for the enlightenment ( aufklärung ) , which took the church in an altogether different direction yet some claim that pietism contributed largely to the revival of biblical studies in germany and to making religion once more an affair of the heart and of life and not merely of the intellect rudolf sohm claimed that '' it was the last great surge of the waves of the ecclesiastical movement begun by the reformation ; it was the completion and the final form of the protestantism created by the reformation '' dietrich bonhoeffer of the german confessing church framed the same characterization in less positive terms when he called pietism the last attempt to save christianity as a religion : given that for him religion was a negative term , more or less an opposite to revelation , this constitutes a rather scathing judgment many lutherans , called old lutherans formed free churches or emigrated to the united states and australia , where they formed bodies that would later become the lutheran church–missouri synod and the lutheran church of australia , respectively ( many immigrants to america , who agreed with the union movement , formed german evangelical lutheran and reformed congregations , later combined into the evangelical synod of north america , which is now a part of the united church of christ ) in the middle of the 19th century , lars levi laestadius spearheaded a pietist revival in scandinavia that upheld what came to be known as laestadian lutheranism , which is heralded today by the laestadian lutheran church as well as by several congregations within mainstream lutheran churches , such as the evangelical lutheran church of finland and the church of sweden laestadius called on his followers to embrace their lutheran identity and as a result , laestadian lutherans have remained a part of the evangelical lutheran church of finland , the national church in that country , with some laestadian lutherans being consecrated as bishops hollingdale , who translated friedrich nietzsche 's thus spake zarathustra into english , argued that a number of the themes of the work ( especially amor fati ) originated in the lutheran pietism of nietzsche 's childhood – nietzsche 's father , carl ludwig nietzsche , was a lutheran pastor who supported the pietist movement in 1900 , the church of the lutheran brethren was founded and it adheres to pietist lutheran theology , emphasizing a born again in england in the late 19th and early 20th century , the nonconformist protestant denominations , such as the methodists , baptists and congregationalists , formed the base of the liberal party balmer says that : evangelicalism itself , i believe , is quintessentially north american phenomenon , deriving as it did from the confluence of pietism , presbyterianism , and the vestiges of puritanism evangelicalism picked up the peculiar characteristics from each strain – warmhearted spirituality from the pietists ( for instance ) , doctrinal precisionism from the presbyterians , and individualistic introspection from the puritans – even as the north american context itself has profoundly shaped the various manifestations of evangelicalism : fundamentalism , neo-evangelicalism , the holiness movement , pentecostalism , the charismatic movement , and various forms of african-american and hispanic evangelicalism the most extensive and current edition on pietism is the four-volume edition in german , covering the entire movement in europe and north america geschichte des pietismus ( gdp ) im auftrag der historischen kommission zur erforschung des pietismus herausgegeben von martin brecht , klaus deppermann , ulrich gäbler und hartmut lehmann ( english : on behalf of the historical commission for the study of pietism edited by martin brecht , klaus deppermann , ulrich gaebler and hartmut lehmann ) band 1 : der pietismus vom siebzehnten bis zum frühen achtzehnten jahrhundert in zusammenarbeit mit ruth albrecht , martin brecht , christian bunners , ulrich gäbler , andreas gestrich , horst gundlach , jan harasimovicz , manfred jakubowski-tiessen , peter kriedtke , martin kruse , werner koch , markus matthias , thomas müller bahlke , gerhard schäfer ( † ) , hans-jürgen schrader , walter sparn , udo sträter , rudolf von thadden , richard trellner , johannes wallmann und hermann wellenreuther hg
