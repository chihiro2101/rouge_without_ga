between 1954 and 1958 , more than 50 sites were excavated in the kutch ( notably dholavira ) , and saurashtra peninsulas , extending the limits of harappan civilisation by to the river kim , where the bhagatrav site accesses the valley of the rivers narmada and tapti the meaning of lothal ( a combination of loth and ( s ) thal ) in gujarati to be '' the mound of the dead '' is not unusual , as the name of the city of mohenjo-daro in sindhi means the same speculation suggests that owing to the comparatively small dimensions of the main city , lothal was not a large settlement at all , and its '' dock '' was perhaps an irrigation tank however , the asi and other contemporary archaeologists assert that the city was a part of a major river system on the trade route of the ancient peoples from sindh to saurashtra in gujarat two sub-periods of harappan culture are distinguished : the same period ( between 2400 and 1900 & nbsp ; bce ) is identical to the exuberant culture of harappa and mohenjo-daro after the core of the indus civilisation had decayed in mohenjo-daro and harappa , lothal seems not only to have survived but to have thrived for many years remote sensing and topographical studies published by indian scientists in the journal of the indian geophysicists union in 2004 revealed an ancient , meandering river adjacent to lothal , in length according to satellite imagery— an ancient extension of the northern river channel bed of a tributary of the bhogavo river harappans based around lothal and from sindh took this opportunity to expand their settlement and create a planned township on the lines of greater cities in the indus valley the rulers of the town lived in the acropolis , which featured paved baths , underground and surface drains ( built of kiln-fired bricks ) and potable water well while the consensus view amongst archaeologists identifies this structure as a '' dockyard , '' it has also been suggested that owing to small dimensions , this basin may have been an irrigation tank and canal the dock was built on the eastern flank of the town , and is regarded by archaeologists as an engineering feat of the highest order facilitating the movement of cargo was a mudbrick wharf , long , built on the western arm of the dock , with a ramp leading to the warehouse however , with rising prosperity , lothal 's people failed to upkeep their walls and dock facilities , possibly as a result of over-confidence in their systems all the construction were made of fire dried bricks , lime and sand mortar and not by sun-dried bricks as bricks are still intact after 4000 years and still bonded together with each other with the mortar bond most of their equipment : metal tools , weights , measures , seals , earthenware and ornaments were of the uniform standard and quality found across the indus civilization while the wider debate over the end of indus civilisation continues , archaeological evidence gathered by the asi appears to point to natural catastrophes , specifically floods and storms as the source of lothal 's downfall the worst consequence was the shift in the course of the river , cutting off access to the ships and dock this is evidenced in adjacent cities of rangpur , rojdi , rupar and harappa in punjab , mohenjo-daro and chanhudaro in sindh the flood affected the entire region of saurashtra , sindh and south gujarat , and affected the upper reaches of the indus and sutlej , where scores of villages and townships were washed away about this time asi archaeologists record a mass movement of refugees from punjab and sindh into saurashtra and to the valley of sarasvati ( 1900–1700 & nbsp ;

bce ( determined by the difference in burial times of the carbon-dated remains ) lothal was one of the most important centres of production for shell-working , owing to the abundance of chank shell of high quality found in the gulf of kutch and near the kathiawar coast lothal produced a large quantity of gold ornaments—the most attractive item being microbeads of gold in five strands in necklaces , unique for being less than 0.25 & nbsp ; millimetres ( 0.010 & nbsp ; inches ) in diameter the discovery of etched carnelian beads and non-etched barrel beads in kish and ur ( modern iraq ) , jalalabad ( afghanistan ) and susa ( iran ) attest to the popularity of the indus bead industry across west asia lothal offers two new types of potter work , a convex bowl with or without stud handle , and a small jar with flaring rim , both in the micaceous red ware period , not found in contemporary indus cultures on a miniature jar , the story of the thirsty crow and deer is depicted – of how the deer could not drink from the narrow-mouth of the jar , while the crow succeeded by dropping stones in the jar a complete set of terra-cotta gamesmen , has been found in lothal—animal figures , pyramids with ivory handles and castle-like objects ( similar to the chess set of queen hatshepsut in egypt ) the asi has covered the peripheral walls , the wharf and many houses of the early phase with earth to protect from natural phenomena , but the entire archaeological site is nevertheless facing grave concerns about necessary preservation this knowledge also enabled them to select lothal 's location in the first place , as the gulf of khambhat has the highest tidal amplitude and ships can be sluiced through flow tides in the river estuary another assessment is that the basin could have served as an irrigation tank , for the estimated original dimensions of the '' dock '' are not large enough , by modern standards , to house ships and conduct much traffic beck author paul yule pages 31 year 1982 the controversy was finally settled when scientists from the national institute of oceanography , goa discovered foraminifera ( marine microfossils ) and salt , gypsum crystals ( due to evapouration of seawater ) in the rectangular structure clearly indicating that sea water once filled the structure when the river changed its course in 2000 & nbsp ;
