the youngest toba eruption has been linked to a genetic bottleneck in human evolution about 70,000 years ago , which may have resulted in a severe reduction in the size of the total human population due to the effects of the eruption on the global climate in 2013 , archaeologists , led by christine lane , reported finding a microscopic layer of glassy volcanic ash in sediments of lake malawi , and definitively linked the ash to the 75,000-year-old eruption at the lake toba caldera , but found no change in fossil type close to the ash layer , something that would be expected following a severe volcanic winter the erupted mass was , at the very least , 12 times greater than that of the largest volcanic eruption in recent history , the 1815 eruption of mount tambora in indonesia , which caused the 1816 '' year without a summer '' in the northern hemisphere rampino and self believe that global cooling was already underway at the time of the eruption , but that the process was slow ; the youngest toba tuff '' may have provided the extra 'kick ' that caused the climate system to switch from warm to cold states '' m.r rampino and s.self , nature 359 , 50 ( 1992 ) proponents of the genetic bottleneck theory ( including robock ) suggest that the youngest toba eruption resulted in a global ecological disaster , including destruction of vegetation along with severe drought in the tropical rainforest belt and in monsoonal regions this eruption was the last and largest of four eruptions of the lake toba caldera during the quaternary period , and is also recognized from its diagnostic horizon of ashfall , the youngest toba tuff rampino and volcanologist stephen self argue that the eruption caused a '' brief , dramatic cooling or 'volcanic winter ' '' , which resulted in a drop of the global mean surface temperature by 3–5 & nbsp ; °c a 2018 study by chad yost and colleagues of cores from lake malawi dating to the period of the youngest toba eruption showed no evidence of a volcanic winter , and they argue that there was no effect on african humans however , assuming an emission of six billion tons of sulphur dioxide , his computer simulations concluded that a maximum global cooling of approximately 15 & nbsp ; °c occurred for three years after the eruption , and that this cooling would last for decades , devastating life the youngest toba eruption occurred at the present location of lake toba in indonesia , about 75,000 ± 900 years bp according to potassium argon dating
