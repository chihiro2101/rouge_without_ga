as such , the diels–alder reaction is governed by orbital symmetry considerations : it is classified as a π 4 s + π 2 s cycloaddition , indicating that it proceeds through the suprafacial/suprafacial interaction of a 4π electron system ( the diene structure ) with a 2π electron system ( the dienophile structure ) , an interaction that leads to a transition state without an additional orbital symmetry-imposed energetic barrier and allows the diels-alder reaction to take place with relative ease ) for the more common '' normal '' electron demand diels–alder reaction , the more important of the two homo/lumo interactions is that between the electron-rich diene 's ψ 2 as the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) with the electron-deficient dienophile 's π as the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) in an inverse electron-demand diels–alder reaction , electron-withdrawing substituents on the diene lower the energy of its empty ψ 3 orbital and electron-donating substituents on the dienophile raise the energy of its filled π orbital sufficiently that the interaction between these two orbitals becomes the most energetically significant stabilizing orbital interaction despite the fact that the vast majority of diels–alder reactions exhibit stereospecific , syn addition of the two components , a diradical intermediate has been postulated ( and supported with computational evidence ) on the grounds that the observed stereospecificity does not rule out a two-step addition involving an intermediate that collapses to product faster than it can rotate to allow for inversion of stereochemistry calculation of the energy and orbital coefficients of the components ' frontier orbitals provides a picture that is in good accord with the more straightforward analysis of the substituents ' resonance effects , as illustrated below in general , the regioselectivity found for both normal and inverse electron-demand diels–alder reaction follows the ortho-para rule , so named , because the cyclohexene product bears substituents in positions that are analogous to the ortho and para positions of disubstituted arenes for example , in a normal-demand scenario , a diene bearing an electron-donating group ( edg ) at c1 has its largest homo coefficient at c4 , while the dienophile with an electron withdrawing group ( ewg ) at c1 has the largest lumo coefficient at c2 in general , with respect to the energetically most well-matched homo-lumo pair , maximizing the interaction energy by forming bonds between centers with the largest frontier orbital coefficients allows the prediction of the main regioisomer that will result from a given diene-dienophile combination in a more sophisticated treatment , three types of substituents ( z withdrawing : homo and lumo lowering ( cf 3 , no 2 , cn , c ( o ) ch 3 ) , x donating : homo and lumo raising ( me , ome , nme 2 ) , c conjugating : homo raising and lumo lowering ( ph , vinyl ) ) are considered , resulting in a total of 18 possible combinations stereochemical information of the diene and the dienophile are retained in the product , as a syn addition with respect to each component likewise , cis , cis- and trans , trans-disubstitued dienes give cis substituents at these carbons of the product whereas cis , trans-disubstituted dienes give trans substituents : diels–alder reactions in which adjacent stereocenters are generated at the two ends of the newly-formed single bonds imply two different possible stereochemical outcomes in the context of the diels–alder reaction , the transition state in which the most significant substituent ( an electron-withdrawing and/or conjugating group ) on the dienophile is oriented towards the diene π system and slips under it as the reaction takes place is known as the endo transition state in this explanation , the orbitals associated with the group in conjugation with the dienophile double-bond overlap with the interior orbitals of the diene , a situation that is possible only for the endo transition state often , as with highly substituted dienes , very bulky dienophiles , or reversible reactions ( as in the case of furan as diene ) , steric effects can override the normal endo selectivity in favor of the exo isomer the diene component of the diels–alder reaction can be either open-chain or cyclic , and it can host many different types of substituents ; it must , however , be able to exist in the s-cis conformation , since this is the only conformer that can participate in the reaction on the contrary , stable dienes are rather unreactive and undergo diels–alder reactions only at elevated temperatures : for example , naphthalene can function as a diene , leading to adducts only with highly reactive dienophiles , such as n-phenyl-maleimide anthracene , being less aromatic ( and therefore more reactive for diels–alder syntheses ) in its central ring can form a 9,10 adduct with maleic anhydride at 80 & nbsp ; °c and even with acetylene , a weak dienophile , at 250 & nbsp ; °c in a normal demand diels–alder reaction , the dienophile has an electron-withdrawing group in conjugation with the alkene ; in an inverse-demand scenario , the dienophile is conjugated with an electron-donating group carbonyl groups , for example , can successfully react with dienes to yield dihydropyran rings , a reaction known as the oxo-diels–alder reaction , and imines can be used , either as the dienophile or at various sites in the diene , to form various n-heterocyclic compounds through the aza-diels–alder reaction the complexed dienophile becomes more electrophilic and more reactive toward the diene , increasing the reaction rate and often improving the regio- and stereoselectivity as well many methods have been developed for influencing the stereoselectivity of the diels–alder reaction , such as the use of chiral auxiliaries , catalysis by chiral lewis acids , and organocatalysis the work by diels and alder is described in a series of 28 articles published in the justus liebigs annalen der chemie and berichte der deutschen chemischen gesellschaft from 1928 to 1937 corey , in his original 1969 synthesis of prostaglandins f2α and e2 , utilized a diels–alder reaction early in the synthesis to establish the relative stereochemistry of three contiguous stereocenters on the prostaglandin cyclopentane core the use of 2-chloroacrylonitrile as dienophile is a viable synthetic equivalent for ketene , a structure that typically underdoes a 2+2 cycloaddition to give a cyclobutanone dimer rather than participating in diels–alder reactions with 1,3-dienes in their 1980 synthesis of reserpine , paul wender and coworkers used a diels–alder reaction to set the cis-decalin framework of the d and e rings of the natural product the cis-fusion allowed for the establishment of the stereochemistry at c17 and c18 : first by cleavage of the acetate group at c18 to give a ketone that can modulate the stereochemistry of the methoxy group c17 , and then by reduction of the ketone at c18 from the exo face to achieve the stereochemistry of the final product the intermolecular reaction of the hydroxy-pyrone and α , β–unsaturated ester shown below suffered from poor yield and regioselectivity ; however , when directed by phenylboronic acid the desired adduct could be obtained in 61 % yield after cleavage of the boronate with 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-propanediol
