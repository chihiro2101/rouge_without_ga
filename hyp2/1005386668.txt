edgar cayce was born on march 18 , 1877 , near beverly , south of hopkinsville , kentucky he was taken to church when he was 10 , and from then he read the bible , becoming engrossed , and completing a dozen readings by the time he was 12 in may 1889 , while reading the bible in his hut in the woods , he 'saw ' a woman with wings who told him that his prayers were answered , and asked him what he wanted most of all the next night , after a complaint from the school teacher , his father ruthlessly tested him for spelling , eventually knocking him out of his chair with exasperation on being questioned , cayce told the teacher that he saw pictures of the pages in the books he was struck on the base of the spine by a ball in a school game , after which he began to act very strangely , and eventually was put to bed during this time , cayce received an eighth-grade education , is said by the association for research and enlightenment to have developed psychic abilities , and left the family farm to pursue various forms of employment in 1900 , cayce formed a business partnership with his father to sell woodmen of the world insurance ; however , in march he was struck by severe laryngitis that resulted in a complete loss of speech since hart had appointments at other cities , he could not continue his hypnotic treatments of cayce , but admitted he had failed because cayce would not go into the third stage of hypnosis to take a suggestion a new york hypnotist , john duncan quackenboss , found the same impediment but , after returning to new york , suggested that cayce should be prompted to take over his own case while in the second stage of hypnosis 116–120 in subsequent sessions , when cayce wanted to indicate that the connection was made to the person or the '' entity '' that was requesting the reading , he would generally start off with , '' we have the body given only the person 's name and location , cayce said he could diagnose the physical and mental conditions of what he termed '' the entity '' , and then provide a remedy in may 1902 he got a bookshop job in the town of bowling green where he boarded with some young professionals , two of whom were doctors he invented a card game called pit or board of trade , simulating wheat market trading , that became popular , but when he sent the idea to a game company they copyrighted it and he got no returns they had three children : hugh lynn cayce ( march 16 , 1907 – july 4 , 1982 ) , milton porter cayce ( march 28 , 1911 – may 17 , 1911 ) , and edgar evans cayce ( february 9 , 1918 – february 15 , 2013 ) a few days later layne revealed the activity to the professionals at the boarding house , one of whom was a magistrate and journalist , after which state medical authorities forced layne to close his practice cayce and a relative opened a photographic studio in bowling green , while the doctors formed a committee with some colleagues to investigate the phenomenon , with cayce ’ s co-operation after a violent examination by doctors while in a trance , cayce refused any more investigations , declaring that he would only do readings for those who needed help and believed in the readings when a reporter contacted cayce , he explained to the reporter that he somehow had the ability to easily go into the intuitive sleep when he wanted to , and this was different from how he went to sleep normally like everyone else when asked the mechanism of the readings via the sleep method , they were told that it happened via the capabilities of the subconscious mind instead the company was to furnish him with a photographic studio for his livelihood , and build a separate office for the readings he preferred to put the readings on a more scientific basis , but only the doctors in hopkinsville would cooperate , whereas most of the patients were not in that locality shortly after this , in 1912 , cayce , whose everyday conscious mind was not aware during the readings , discovered that ketchum had not been honest about them , and had also used them to gamble for finance the growing fame of cayce along with the popularity he received from newspapers attracted several eager commercially minded men who wanted to seek a fortune by using his clairvoyant abilities even though cayce was reluctant to help them , he was persuaded to give his readings , which left him dissatisfied with himself and unsuccessful a cotton merchant offered him a hundred dollars a day for his readings about the daily outcomes in the cotton market ; however , despite his poor finances , cayce refused the merchant 's offer cayce was told by lammers that , while in his trance state , he spoke of lammers ' past lives and of reincarnation , something lammers believed in you see , i have been studying metaphysics for years , and i was able by a few questions , by the facts you gave , to check what is right and what is wrong with a whole lot of the stuff i 've been reading cayce 's stenographer recorded the following : : in this we see the plan of development of those individuals set upon this plane , meaning the ability to enter again into the presence of the creator and become a full part of that creation cayce was quite unconvinced that he had been referring to the doctrine of reincarnation , and the best lammers could offer was that the reading '' opens up the door '' and to go on to share his beliefs and knowledge with cayce lammers had come to him with quite a bit of information of his own to share with cayce and seemed intent upon convincing cayce now that he felt the reading had confirmed his strongly-held beliefs it appeared that cayce 's subconscious mind was as much at home with the language of metaphysics as it was with the language of anatomy and medicine lammers wanted to ask the purpose of readings of cayce 's clairvoyance , and to put up money for an organization supporting cayce 's healing methods cayce used his knowledge of the bible to convince his family that the word of the bible agreed with reincarnation and other metaphysical teachings the remedies that were channeled often involved the use of unusual electrotherapy , ultraviolet light , diet , massage , gemstones , less mental work and more relaxation in sand on the beach his remedies were coming under the scrutiny of the american medical association and cayce felt that it was time to legitimize the operations with the aid of licensed medical practitioners in 1925 cayce reported while in a trance , '' the voice '' had instructed him to move to virginia beach , virginia across the street from the beach the idea of an association and a hospital was mooted again , but the readings insisted on virginia beach , not suiting most of the people morton blumenthal , a young man who worked in the stock exchange in new york with his trader brother , became very interested in the readings , shared cayce 's outlook , and offered to finance the vision in the right spirit to protect against legal prosecution , the rules required any person requesting a reading to become a member of the association and agree they were participating in an experiment in psychic research early in 1928 , moseley brown , head of the psychology department at washington and lee university , became convinced of the readings and joined the association there were consistent remedies for many of the illnesses regardless of the patient , and cayce hoped to produce a compendium that could be used by the medical profession bisley , dphil ( oxon ) , who also used '' psychic knowledge '' to produce medicines , collaborated with cayce to produce atomidine , an absorbable form of iodine , which was perfected and sold therapies as divergent as salt packs , poultices , hot compresses , chromotherapy , magnetism , vibrator treatment , massage , osteopathic manipulation , dental therapy , colonics , enemas , antiseptics , inhalants , homeopathics , essential oils , mud baths were prescribed substances used included oils , salts , herbs , iodine , witch hazel , magnesia , bismuth , alcohol , castoria , lactated pepsin , turpentine , charcoal , animated ash , soda , cream of tartar , aconite , laudanum , camphor , and gold solution blumenthal and brown went ahead with ambitious plans for a university as a supplement to the hospital and a '' parallel service for the mind and spirit '' from his altered state , cayce relayed to this group that the purpose of life is not to become psychic , but to become a more spiritually aware and loving person the readings were now about dreams , coincidence ( synchronicity ) , developing intuition , karma , the akashic records , astrology , past-life relationships , soul mates and other esoteric subjects on june 6 , 1931 , 61 people attended a meeting to carry on the work and form a new organization called the association for research and enlightenment hugh lynn proposed that they develop a stock in trade rather than something grandiose , and that they build a library of research into the phenomena and hold study groups , and that cayce would do two readings a day hugh lynn narrowed the mailing list to some 300 members who were genuinely enthusiastic , and as a result the first annual congress of the association was held in june 1932 everything was then checked with the subjects of the readings , most of whom were not present during the reading , and the data was published in a study entitled '' 100 cases of clairvoyance '' members raised a building fund for an office , library , and vault , which they erected in 1940–41 as a single unit added on to the cayce residence the other half remained a solid basis for the research work , an audience for case studies , pamphlets , bulletins—and the congress bulletin , which was a yearbook and record of congress events members were drawn from all of the protestant churches : from the roman , greek , syrian and armenian catholic churches ; from theosophy , christian science and spiritualism ; and from many oriental religions in march 1943 the first edition of the only biography written during cayce 's lifetime , there is a river by thomas sugrue , was published the readings themselves scolded him for attempting too much and that he should limit his workload to just two life readings a day or else these good efforts would eventually kill him when he gave a reading on this situation , the instructions were to rest until he was well or dead he and gertrude went away to the mountains of virginia , but in september edgar cayce suffered a stroke at the age of 67 , in september 1944 , and died on january 3 , 1945 the association continued the work of classifying and cross-referencing the over 14,000 files of readings that had been taken throughout cayce 's lifetime from march 31 , 1901 , to september 17 , 1944 however , an article published in the birmingham post-herald on october 10 , 1922 , quotes cayce as saying that he had given 8,056 readings as of that date and it is known that he gave approximately 13,000–14,000 readings after that date cayce said he became interested in learning more about these subjects after he was informed about the content of his readings , which he reported that he never actually heard himself in 1971 edgar cayce 's sons edgar evans cayce and hugh lynn cayce published a book titled the outer limits of edgar cayce 's power , claiming cayce 's readings had an approximate 85 % success rate cayce also accepted the existence of aliens and atlantis , and claimed that '' the red race developed in atlantis and its development was rapid historian olav hammer wrote that many of cayce 's readings discussed race and skin color and according to hammer , the explanation for this is that cayce was not a racism but was influenced by the occult ideas of helena blavatsky in his 2003 book the skeptic 's dictionary , philosopher and skeptic robert todd carroll wrote , '' cayce is one of the main people responsible for some of the sillier notions about atlantis '' carroll mentioned some of cayce 's ideas , including his belief in a giant solar crystal , activated by the sun , and used to harness energy and provide power on atlantis , and his prediction that in 1958 , the united states would rediscover a death ray that had been used on atlantis cayce , who made his diagnoses while in trance , claimed that his healing powers came from god martin gardner , for example , wrote that all of the '' verified '' claims and descriptions from cayce 's trances can be traced to ideas found in the books that cayce had been reading by authors such as carl jung , p gardner concluded that the trance readings of cayce contain , '' little bits of information gleaned from here and there in the occult literature , spiced with occasional novelties from cayce 's unconscious '' why people believe weird things : pseudoscience , superstition , and other confusions of our time , 2002 , shermer wrote that , '' cayce was fantasy-prone from his youth , often talking with angels and receiving visions of his dead grandfather frequently , cayce was even wider off the mark , as when he provided diagnoses of subjects who had died since the letters requesting the readings were sent cayce was n't able to cure his own cousin , or his own son who died as a baby the edgar cayce primer :
