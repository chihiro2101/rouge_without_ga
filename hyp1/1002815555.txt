38–40 , is a letter from the poet dated 18 august 1812 , extolling the poetical merits of the performance and with equal exaggeration censuring what he thought the author 's misguided patriotism peacock was fond of harriet , and in his old age defended her reputation from slanders spread by jane , lady shelley , the daughter-in-law of shelley 's second wife mary after shelley deserted harriet , peacock became an almost daily visitor throughout the winter of 1814–15 of shelley and mary godwin ( later mary shelley ) , at their london lodgings '' he seems '' , writes charles clairmont , mary godwin 's stepbrother and a member of the party , '' an idly-inclined man ; indeed , he is professedly so in the summer ; he owns he can not apply himself to study , and thinks it more beneficial to him as a human being entirely to devote himself to the beauties of the season while they last ; he was only happy while out from morning till night '' shelley 's influence upon peacock may be traced in the latter 's poem of rhododaphne , or the thessalian spell , published in 1818 and shelley wrote a eulogistic review of it at the beginning of 1819 , peacock was unexpectedly summoned to london for a period of probation with the east india company who needed to reinforce their staff with talented people peacock was included at the recommendation of peter auber , the company historian , whom he had known at school , though probably not as a school-fellow it is not in the common routine of office , but is an employment of a very interesting and intellectual kind , connected with finance and legislation , in which it is possible to be of great service , not only to the company , but to the millions under their dominion in 1820 peacock contributed to ollier 's literary pocket book and wrote the four ages of poetry , the latter of which argued that poetry 's relevance was being ended by science , a claim which provoked shelley 's defence of poetry the official duties of the india house delayed the completion and publication of maid marian , begun in 1818 , until 1822 , and as a result of the delay it was taken for an imitation of ivanhoe although its composition had , in fact , preceded scott 's novel peacock 's salary was now £1000 a year , and in 1823 he acquired a country residence at lower halliford , near shepperton , middlesex , constructed out of two old cottages , where he could gratify the love of the thames , which was as strong as his enthusiasm for classical literature in the winter of 1825–26 he wrote paper money lyrics and other poems '' during the prevalence of an influenza to which the beautiful fabric of paper-credit is periodically subject '' in his early time at the india office he wrote little except for the operatic criticisms which he regularly contributed to the examiner , and an occasional article in the westminster review or bentley 's miscellany in this role in 1834 , he resisted james silk buckingham 's claim to compensation for his expulsion from the east indies , and in 1836 , he defeated the attack of the liverpool merchants and cheshire manufacturers upon the indian salt monopoly the post was one which could only be filled by someone of sound business capacity and exceptional ability in drafting official documents : and peacock 's discharge of its duties , it is believed , suffered nothing by comparison either with his distinguished predecessor or his still more celebrated successor , stuart mill he wrote a poem on '' a day at the india office '' : in about 1852 towards the end of peacock 's service in the india office , his zeal or leisure for authorship returned , and he began to contribute to fraser 's magazine in which appeared his entertaining and scholarly horæ dramaticæ , a restoration of the querolus , a roman comedy probably of the time of diocletian , and his reminiscences of shelley his last writings were two translations , gl ' ingannati ( the deceived ) a comedy , performed at siena in 1861 and ælia lælia crispis of which a limited edition was circulated in 1862 peacock died at lower halliford , 23 january 1866 , from injuries sustained in a fire in which he had attempted to save his library , and is buried in the new cemetery at shepperton that he has nevertheless been the favourite only of the few is owing partly to the highly intellectual quality of his work , but mainly to his lack of ordinary qualifications of the novelist , all pretension to which he entirely disclaims plato 's symposium is the literary ancestor of these works , by way of the deipnosophists of athenaeus , in which the conversation relates less to exalted philosophical themes than to the points of a good fish dinner mark ( 1804 ) palmyra and other poems ( 1805 ) the genius of the thames : a lyrical poem ( 1810 ) the genius of the thames palmyra and other poems ( 1812 ) the philosophy of melancholy ( 1812 ) sir hornbook , or childe launcelot 's expedition ( 1813 ) sir proteus : a satirical ballad ( 1814 ) the round table , or king arthur 's feast ( 1817 ) rhododaphne : or the thessalian spirit ( 1818 ) paper money lyrics ( 1837 ) '' the war-song of dinas vawr '' ( in the misfortunes of elphin , 1829 ) the four ages of poetry ( 1820 ) recollections of childhood : the abbey house ( 1837 ) memoirs of shelley ( 1858–62 ) the last day of windsor forest ( 1887 ) composed 1862 prospectus : classical education
