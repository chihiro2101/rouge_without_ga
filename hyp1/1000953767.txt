in use , the rdf operator would first tune the receiver to the correct frequency , then manually turn the loop , either listening or watching an s meter to determine the direction of the null ( the direction at which a given signal is weakest ) of a long wave ( lw ) or medium wave ( am ) broadcast beacon or station ( listening for the null is easier than listening for a peak signal , and normally produces a more accurate result ) gebhard , louis a '' evolution of naval radio-electronics and contributions of the naval research laboratory '' ( 1979 ) after world war ii , there were many small and large firms making direction finding equipment for mariners , including apelco , aqua guide , bendix , gladding ( and its marine division , pearce-simpson ) , ray jefferson , raytheon , and sperry however the low cost of adf and rdf systems , and the continued existence of am broadcast stations ( as well as navigational beacons in countries outside north america ) has allowed these devices to continue to function , primarily for use in small boats , as an adjunct or backup to gps since these radio signals are broadcast in all directions ( omnidirectional ) during the day , the signal itself does not include direction information , and these beacons are therefore referred to as non-directional beacons , or ndbs while these commercial radio stations can be useful due to their high power and location near major cities , there may be several miles between the location of the station and its transmitter , which can reduce the accuracy of the 'fix ' when approaching the broadcast city this made rdf so much more practical that it was soon being used for navigation on a wide scale , often as the first form of aerial navigation available , with ground stations homing in on the aircraft 's radio set by the 1960s , many of these radios were actually made by japanese electronics manufacturers , such as panasonic , fuji onkyo , and yoji ito in aircraft equipment , bendix and sperry-rand were two of the larger manufacturers of rdf radios and navigation instruments in the 1950s , aviation ndbs were augmented by the vor system , in which the direction to the beacon can be extracted from the signal itself , hence the distinction with non-directional beacons while this information provided a baseline from the station to the ship or aircraft , the navigator still needed to know beforehand if he was to the east or west of the station in order to avoid plotting a course 180-degrees in the wrong direction this led to the 1919 introduction of the adcock antenna ( uk patent 130,490 ) , which consisted of four separate monopole antennas instead of two loops , eliminating the horizontal components and thus filtering out the sky waves being reflected down from the ionosphere the transmitter sends a morse code transmission on a long wave ( 150 – 400 & nbsp ; khz ) or medium wave ( 520 – 1720 & nbsp ; khz ) frequency incorporating the station 's identifier that is used to confirm the station and its operational status the rdf station might now receive the same signal from two or more locations , especially during the day , which caused serious problems trying to determine the location pseudo-doppler radio direction finder systems use a series of small dipole antennas arranged in a ring and use electronic switching to rapidly select dipoles to feed into the receiver the signals from the antennas were sent into coils wrapped around a wooden frame about the size of a pop can , where the signals were re-created in the area between the coils in spite of the system being presented publicly , and its measurements widely reported in the uk , its impact on the art of rdf seems to be strangely subdued development was limited until the mid-1930s , when the various british forces began widespread development and deployment of these '' high-frequency direction finding '' , or '' huff-duff '' systems this meant there was always an ambiguity in the location of the signal , it would produce the same output if the signal was in front or back of the antenna automatic direction finder ( adf ) acronyms and abbreviations in avionics amateur radio direction finding battle of the beams cardioid direction finding hf/df radio navigation real-time locating system traffic analysis vor/dme wullenweber antennas are generally sensitive to signals only when they have a length that is a significant portion of the wavelength , or larger a major improvement in the rdf technique was introduced by robert watson-watt as part of his experiments to locate lightning strikes as a method to indicate the direction of thunderstorms for sailors and airmen in particular , the ability to compare the phase of signals led to phase-comparison rdf , which is perhaps the most widely used technique today however , when the same technique was being applied to higher frequencies , unexpected difficulties arose due to the reflection of high frequency signals from the ionosphere improved vacuum tubes and the introduction of the transistor allowed much higher frequencies to be used economically , which led to widespread use of vhf and uhf signals when the office was moved , his new location at a radio research station provided him with both an adcock antenna and a suitable oscilloscope , and he presented his new system in 1926
