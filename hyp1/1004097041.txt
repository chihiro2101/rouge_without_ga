however , if one considers communities to simply possess boundaries of some sort between their members and non-members , then a virtual community is certainly a community early research into the existence of media-based communities was concerned with the nature of reality , whether communities actually could exist through the media , which could place virtual community research into the social sciences definition of ontology as well , benedict anderson 's imagined communities in 1983 , described how different technologies , such as national newspapers , contributed to the development of national and regional consciousness among early nation-states some authors that built their theories on anderson 's imagined communities have been critical of the concept , claiming that all communities are based on communication and that virtual/real dichotomy is disintegrating , making use of the word '' virtual '' problematic or even obsolete virtual communities are used for a variety of social and professional groups ; interaction between community members vary from personal to purely formal the software for social media pages or virtual communities is structured around the users ’ experience and designed specifically for online use when it comes to testing user experience in a software interface , three main characteristics are needed : a user who is engaged , a user who is interacting with a product or interface , and defining the users ’ experience in ways that are and observable or measurable the widespread use of the internet and virtual communities by millions of diverse users for socializing is a phenomenon that raises new issues for researchers and developers some well-established measures applied to the usability framework for online communities are speed of learning , productivity , user satisfaction , how much people remember using the software , and how many errors they make people communicate their social identities or culture code through the work they do , the way they talk , the clothes they wear , their eating habits , domestic environments and possessions , and use of leisure time people with rare or debilitating disorders may not be able to access support groups in their physical community , thus online communities act as primary means for such support online content-sharing sites have made it easy for youth as well as others to not only express themselves and their ideas through digital media , but also connect with large networked communities within these spaces , young people are pushing the boundaries of traditional forms of engagement such as voting and joining political organizations and creating their own ways to discuss , connect , and act in their communities in his book the wealth of networks from 2006 , yochai benkler suggests that virtual communities would '' come to represent a new form of human communal existence , providing new scope for building a shared experience of human interaction '' the two main effects that can be seen according to benkler are a '' thickening of preexisting relations with friends , family and neighbours '' and the beginnings of the '' emergence of greater scope for limited-purpose , loose relationships '' previous concerns about the effects of internet use on community and family fell into two categories : 1 ) sustained , intimate human relations '' are critical to well-functioning human beings as a matter of psychological need '' and 2 ) people with '' social capital '' are better off than those who lack it however , benkler argues that unless internet connections actually displace direct , unmediated , human contact , there is no basis to think that using the internet will lead to a decline in those nourishing connections we need psychologically , or in the useful connections we make socially there is a shift from individuals who depend upon locally embedded , unmediated and stable social relationships to networked individuals who are more dependent upon their own combination of strong and weak ties across boundaries and weave their own fluid relationships lisa nakamura argues in chapter 16 of her 2002 book after/image of identity : gender , technology , and identity politics , that technology gives us iterations of our age , race and gender in virtual spaces , as opposed to them being fully extinguished doctor sherry turkle , professor of social studies of science and technology at mit , believes the internet is a place where actions of discrimination are less likely to occur in her 1995 book life on the screen : identity in the age of the internet , she argues that discrimination is easier in reality as it is easier to identify as face value , what is contrary to your norm for these reasons , turkle argues users existing in online spaces are less compelled to judge or compare ourselves to our peers , allowing people in virtual settings an opportunity to gain a greater capacity for acknowledging diversity identity tourism , in the context of cyberspace , is a term used to the describe the phenomenon of users donning and doffing other-race and other-gender personae the gaming community is extremely vast and accessible to a wide variety of people , however , there are negative effects on the relationships 'gamers ' have with the medium when expressing identity of gender doctor adrienne shaw notes in her 2012 article do you identify as a gamer ? gender , race , sexuality , and gamer identity , that gender , perhaps subconsciously , plays a large role in identifying oneself as a 'gamer the explosive diffusion of the internet since the mid-1990s fostered the proliferation of virtual communities in the form of social networking services and online communities virtual communities may synthesize web 2.0 technologies with the community , and therefore have been described as community 2.0 , although strong community bonds have been forged online since the early 1970s on timeshare systems like plato and later on usenet the lack of status that is presented with an online identity also might encourage people , because , if one chooses to keep it private , there is no associated label of gender , age , ethnicity or lifestyle shortly after the rise of interest in message boards and forums , people started to want a way of communicating with their '' communities '' in real time the downside to message boards was that people would have to wait until another user replied to their posting , which , with people all around the world in different time frames , could take a while chat rooms are now provided by internet relay chat ( irc ) and other individual websites such as yahoo , msn , and aol there is usually a list of the users who are currently in the room , so that people can see who is in their virtual community users create their own avatar character ( from choosing the avatar 's outfits to designing the avatar 's house ) and control their character 's life and interactions with other characters in the 3-d virtual world when characters interact with other characters , they can get to know one another through text-based talking and virtual experience ( such as having avatars go on a date in the virtual world ) communities in virtual worlds are most similar to real-life communities because the characters are physically in the same place , even if the users who are operating the characters are not these business based worlds have stricter controls and allow functionality such as muting individual participants , desktop sharing , or access lists to provide a highly interactive and controlled virtual world to a specific business or group on facebook , for example , one can upload photos and videos , chat , make friends , reconnect with old ones , and join groups or causes all of these functions encourage people to form a community , large or small , on the internet the exchange and consumption of information requires a degree of '' digital literacy '' , such that users are able to '' archive , annotate , appropriate , transform and recirculate media content '' ( jenkins ) for example , tasteofhome.com , the website of the magazine taste of home , is a specialized information community that focuses on baking and cooking his comment on the first page even illustrates the social networks in the virtual society : '' my seven year old daughter knows that her father congregates with a family of invisible friends who seem to gather in his computer indeed , in his revised version of virtual community , rheingold goes so far to say that had he read barry wellman 's work earlier , he would have called his book '' online social networks '' lipnack & stamps ( 1997 ) and mowshowitz ( 1997 ) point out how virtual communities can work across space , time and organizational boundaries ; lipnack & stamps ( 1997 ) mention a common purpose ; and lee , eom , jung and kim ( 2004 ) introduce '' desocialization '' which means that there is less frequent interaction with humans in traditional settings , e.g recently , mitch parsell ( 2008 ) has suggested that virtual communities , particularly those that leverage web 2.0 resources , can be pernicious by leading to attitude polarization , increased prejudices and enabling sick individuals to deliberately indulge in their diseases this interaction allows people to engage in many activities from their home , such as : shopping , paying bills , and searching for specific information users of online communities also have access to thousands of specific discussion groups where they can form specialized relationships and access information in such categories as : politics , technical assistance , social activities , health ( see above ) and recreational pleasures in theory , online identities can be kept anonymous which enables people to use the virtual community for fantasy role playing as in the case of second life 's use of avatars clan ( computer gaming )
