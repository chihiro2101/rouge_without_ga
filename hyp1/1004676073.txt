54 these texts were written on the walls of the burial chambers within pyramids , and were exclusively for the use of the pharaoh ( and , from the 6th dynasty , the queen ) the pyramid texts were written in an unusual hieroglyphic style ; many of the hieroglyphs representing humans or animals were left incomplete or drawn mutilated , most likely to prevent them causing any harm to the dead pharaoh 54 the purpose of the pyramid texts was to help the dead king take his place amongst the gods , in particular to reunite him with his divine father ra ; at this period the afterlife was seen as being in the sky , rather than the underworld described in the book of the dead the coffin texts were available to wealthy private individuals , vastly increasing the number of people who could expect to participate in the afterlife ; a process which has been described as the '' democratization of the afterlife '' the earliest known occurrence of the spells included in the book of the dead is from the coffin of queen mentuhotep , of the 13th dynasty , where the new spells were included amongst older texts known from the pyramid texts and coffin texts some of the spells introduced at this time claim an older provenance ; for instance the rubric to spell 30b states that it was discovered by the prince hordjedef in the reign of king menkaure , many hundreds of years before it is attested in the archaeological record taylor 2010 , p.34 by the 17th dynasty , the book of the dead had become widespread not only for members of the royal family , but courtiers and other officials as well from this period onward the book of the dead was typically written on a papyrus scroll , and the text illustrated with vignettes taylor 2010 , p.35 & ndash ; 7 in the third intermediate period , the book of the dead started to appear in hieratic script , as well as in the traditional hieroglyphics in the late period and ptolemaic period , the book of the dead continued to be based on the saite recension , though increasingly abbreviated towards the end of the ptolemaic period faulkner 1994 , p.145 ; taylor 2010 , p.29 in the context of the book of the dead , it is typically translated as either chapter or spell some are intended to give the deceased mystical knowledge in the afterlife , or perhaps to identify them with the gods : for instance , spell 17 is an obscure and lengthy description of the god atum taylor 2010 , p.51 , 56 others are incantations to ensure the different elements of the dead person 's being were preserved and reunited , and to give the deceased control over the world around him the act of speaking a ritual formula was an act of creation ; taylor 2010 , p.30 there is a sense in which action and speech were one and the same thing taylor 2010 , p.32 & ndash ; 3 ; faulkner 1994 , p.148 the egyptians also believed that knowing the name of something gave power over it ; thus , the book of the dead equips its owner with the mystical names of many of the entities he would encounter in the afterlife , giving him power over them taylor 2010 , p.30 & ndash ; 1 the spells of the book of the dead made use of several magical techniques which can also be seen in other areas of egyptian life taylor , p.58 the books of the dead from the saite period tend to organize the chapters into four sections : chapters 1–16 the deceased enters the tomb and descends to the underworld , and the body regains its powers of movement and speech mummification served to preserve and transform the physical body into sah , an idealised form with divine aspects ; taylor 2010 , p.17 & 20 the book of the dead contained spells aimed at preserving the body of the deceased , which may have been recited during the process of mummification taylor 2010 , p.161 the heart , which was regarded as the aspect of being which included intelligence and memory , was also protected with spells , and in case anything happened to the physical heart , it was common to bury jewelled heart scarabs with a body to provide a replacement taylor 2010 , p.163-4 the name of the dead person , which constituted their individuality and was required for their continued existence , was written in many places throughout the book , and spell 25 ensured the deceased would remember their own name it was the ba , depicted as a human-headed bird , which could '' go forth by day '' from the tomb into the world ; spells 61 and 89 acted to preserve it in the book of the dead , the dead were taken into the presence of the god osiris , who was confined to the subterranean duat taylor 2010 , p.239 & ndash ; 241 as well as joining the gods , the book of the dead also depicts the dead living on in the 'field of reeds ' , a paradisiac likeness of the real world these statuettes were inscribed with a spell , also included in the book of the dead , requiring them to undertake any manual labour that might be the owner 's duty in the afterlife these creatures had to be pacified by reciting the appropriate spells included in the book of the dead ; once pacified they posed no further threat , and could even extend their protection to the dead person taylor 2010 , p.215 if the heart was out of balance with maat , then another fearsome beast called ammit , the devourer , stood ready to eat it and put the dead person 's afterlife to an early and unpleasant end john taylor points out the wording of spells 30b and 125 suggests a pragmatic approach to morality ; by preventing the heart from contradicting him with any inconvenient truths , it seems that the deceased could enter the afterlife even if their life had not been entirely pure ogden goelet says '' without an exemplary and moral existence , there was no hope for a successful afterlife '' , while geraldine pinch suggests that the negative confession is essentially similar to the spells protecting from demons , and that the success of the weighing of the heart depended on the mystical knowledge of the true names of the judges rather than on the deceased 's moral behaviour image : papyrus ani curs hiero.jpg thumb right a close-up of the papyrus of ani , showing the cursive hieroglyphs of the text a book of the dead papyrus was produced to order by scribes & nbsp ; 264 most owners of the book of the dead were evidently part of the social elite ; they were initially reserved for the royal family , but later papyri are found in the tombs of scribes , priests and officials the scribes working on book of the dead papyri took more care over their work than those working on more mundane texts ; care was taken to frame the text within margins , and to avoid writing on the joints between sheets & nbsp ; 267 for instance , in the papyrus of ani , the name '' ani '' appears at the top or bottom of a column , or immediately following a rubric introducing him as the speaker of a block of text ; the name appears in a different handwriting to the rest of the manuscript , and in some places is mis-spelt or omitted entirely the text of a new kingdom book of the dead was typically written in cursive hieroglyphs , most often from left to right , but also sometimes from right to left the calligraphy is similar to that of other hieratic manuscripts of the new kingdom ; the text is written in horizontal lines across wide columns ( often the column size corresponds to the size of the papyrus sheets of which a scroll is made up ) the text of a book of the dead was written in both black and red ink , regardless of whether it was in hieroglyphic or hieratic script most of the text was in black , with rubric used for the titles of spells , opening and closing sections of spells , the instructions to perform spells correctly in rituals , and also for the names of dangerous creatures such as the demon apep since it was found in tombs , it was evidently a document of a religious nature , and this led to the widespread but mistaken belief that the book of the dead was the equivalent of a bible or qur'an faulkner 1994 , p.13 taylor 210 , p.288 & nbsp ; 9 in 1842 karl richard lepsius published a translation of a manuscript dated to the ptolemaic era and coined the name '' book of the dead '' ( das todtenbuch ) this project was undertaken by édouard naville , starting in 1875 and completed in 1886 , producing a three-volume work including a selection of vignettes for every one of the 186 spells he worked with , the more significant variations of the text for every spell , and commentary today the book of the dead project , as it is called , maintains a database of documentation and photography covering 80 % of extant copies and fragments from the corpus of book of the dead texts , and provides current services to egyptologists 2345 bce – first royal pyramid , of king unas , to contain the pyramid texts , carved precursors ( intended only for the king ) to the funerary literature from which the book of the dead ultimately developed c 1600 bce – earliest spells of the book of the dead , on the coffin of queen menthuhotep , an ancestor of kings from the new kingdom c 1550 bce – from this time onward to the beginning of the new kingdom , papyrus copies of the book of the dead are used instead of inscribing spells on the walls of the tombs c 600 bce – approximately when the order of the spells became standard 42–553 ce – christianity spreads to egypt , gradually replacing the native religion as successive emperors alternately tolerate or suppress them , culminating in the last temple at philae ( also site of the last known religious inscription in demotic , dating from 452 ) being closed by order of emperor justinian in 533 2nd century ce – possibly the last copies of the book of the dead were produced , but it is a poorly documented era of history 1798 ce – napoleon 's invasion of egypt encourages european interests in ancient egypt ;
