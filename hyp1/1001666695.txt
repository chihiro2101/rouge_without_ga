when work ( file transfer or command execution requests ) is queued for a neighbor system , the program typically calls that system to process the work for instance , when the caller responds with their system name , the called system may optionally hang up if it does not recognize the caller , sending the ryou are unknown to me\0 response string and then disconnecting when the s command is received on the called system , it responds with sy if it succeeded and it is ready to accept the file , or snx if it failed , where x is a failure reason it is otherwise similar to s , using ry and rn to indicate the command was accepted and it will begin to send data or had a problem , and expecting a cy and cn5 from the caller at the end of the transfer after sending an h command , the calling system sends a final packet ( control-p , six ohs , null-terminator ) and the called system responds with ( control-p , seven ohs , null-terminator ) these include a secondary channel that can send command data interspersed with a file transfer , and the ability to renegotiate the packet and window sizes during transmission the next byte is the data type and finally , the last byte is the xor of the header , allowing it to be checked separately from the payload tt is the packet type , 0 for control packets ( which also requires k 9 to be valid ) , 1 for alternate data ( not used in uucp ) , 2 for data , and 3 indicates a short packet that re-defines the meaning of k in a data packet , xxx is the packet number for this packet from 0 to 7 , and yyy is the last that was received correctly for instance , transfers are started by sending a short control packet with tt 0 ( control ) , xxx 7 and yyy the number of packets in a window , then sending another packet with xxx 6 and yyy as the packet length ( encoded as it would be in k ) and then a third packet that is identical to the first but xxx 5 telebit modems used protocol spoofing to improve the performance of g-protocol transfers by noticing end-of-packet markers being sent to the remote system and immediately sending an back to the local host , pretending that the remote system had already received the packet and decoded it correctly the data between the two modems was error-corrected using a proprietary protocol based on mnp that ran over telebit 's half-duplex connections much better than g-protocol would normally , because in the common 64x3 case the remote system would be sending a constant stream of s that would overflow the low-speed return channel the less-used e-protocol , which originated the honeydanber versions as opposed to t from bsd , differs only in that commands are not packetized and are instead sent as normal strings , while files are padded to the nearest 20 bytes taylor uucp also incorporated features of all previous versions of uucp , allowing it to communicate with any other version and even use similar config file formats from other versions packages such as uuslave/gnuucp ( john gilmore , garry paxinos , tim pozar ) , uupc/extended ( drew derbyshire of kendra electronic wonderworks ) and fsuucp ( christopher ambler of iodesign ) , brought early internet connectivity to personal computers , expanding the network beyond the interconnected university systems as an example , ufgate ( john galvin , garry paxinos , tim pozar ) was a package that provided a gateway between networks running fidonet and uucp protocols a simple uucp mail address was formed from the adjacent machine name , an exclamation mark ( often pronounced bang ) , followed by the user name on the adjacent machine for example , if machine barbox is not connected to the local machine , but it is known that barbox is connected to machine foovax which does communicate with the local machine , the appropriate address to send mail to would be foovax ! barbox ! user this directs people to route their mail to machine bigsite ( presumably a well-known and well-connected machine accessible to everybody ) and from there through the machine foovax to the account of user user on barbox uucp was sometimes used to designate a hostname as being reachable by uucp networking , although this was never formally registered in the domain name system ( dns ) as a top-level domain a uucp-only site can register a dns domain name , and have the dns server that handles that domain provide mx records that cause internet mail to that site to be delivered to a uucp host on the internet that can then deliver the mail to the uucp site the uucp mapping project was a volunteer , largely successful effort to build a map of the connections between machines that were open mail relays and establish a managed namespace many uucp hosts , particularly those at universities , were also connected to the internet in its early years , and e-mail gateways between internet smtp-based mail and uucp mail were developed a user at a system with uucp connections could thereby exchange mail with internet users , and the internet links could be used to bypass large portions of the slow uucp network with this infrastructure in place , uucp 's strength was that it permitted a site to gain internet e-mail and usenet connectivity with only a dial-up modem link to another cooperating computer the uux command is used to execute a command on a remote system , or to execute a command on the local system using files from remote systems the command is run by the daemon , which handles remote execution requests as simply another kind of file to batch-send to the remote system whenever a next-hop node is available in july 2012 , dutch internet provider xs4all closed down its uucp service , claiming it was '' probably one of the last providers in the world that still offered it '' ; it had only 13 users at that time ( however prior to its shut-down it had refused requests from new users for several years ) in addition to legacy use , in 2021 new and innovative uucp uses are growing , especially for telecommunications in the hf band , for example , for communities in the amazon rainforest for email exchange and other uses a patch to ian 's uucp was contributed to uucp debian linux package to adapt for the hermes ( high-frequency emergency and rural multimedia exchange system ) project , which provides uucp hf connectivity in the mid 2000s , uucp over tcp/ip ( often encrypted , using the ssh protocol ) was proposed for use when a computer does not have any fixed ip addresses but is still willing to run a standard mail transfer agent ( mta ) like sendmail or postfix bang-like paths are still in use within the usenet network , though not for routing ; they are used to record , in the header of a message , the nodes through which that message has passed , rather than to direct where it will go next
