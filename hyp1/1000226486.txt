during early 1930 he used the same principle as the basis for the design of a disc-shaped aircraft called aerodina lenticulară ( lens-shaped aerodyne ) , a '' flying saucer '' shaped aircraft that used an unspecified source of high-pressure gases to flow through a ring-shaped vent system harry stine—a rocket scientist , author and '' the father of american model rocketry '' —stated in his book the hopeful future that '' there were several jet-propelled aircraft in existence at an early time-the coandă-1910 jet and the 1938 caproni campini n.1 , the pure jet aircraft flight was made in germany in 1938 '' rolf sonnemann and klaus krug from the university of technology of dresden , mentioned in passing in their 1987 book technik und technikwissenschaften in der geschichte ( technology and technical sciences in history ) that the coandă-1910 was the world 's first jet in 1969 , during the early years of the ceauşescu era , he returned to spend his last days in his native romania , where he served as director of the institute for scientific and technical creation ( increst ) and in 1971 reorganized , along with professor elie carafoli , the department of aeronautical engineering of the polytechnic university of bucharest , spinning it off from the department of mechanical engineering in 1910 , in the workshop of gianni caproni , he designed and built an aircraft known as the coandă-1910 , which he displayed publicly at the second international aeronautic salon in paris that year the aircraft used a 4-cylinder piston engine to power a rotary compressor which was intended to propel the craft by a combination of suction at the front and airflow out the rear instead of using a propeller in 1915 , he returned to france where , working during world war i for delaunay-belleville in saint-denis , he designed and built three different models of propeller aeroplane , including the coandă-1916 , with two propellers mounted close to the tail '' gibbs-smith continued , '' the claim said that after a disastrous crash ( which never happened ) coandă wished to begin a 'second aircraft ' , but 'his funds were exhausted coandă graduated as an artillery officer , but he was more interested in the technical problems of flight he graduated in 1903 with the rank of sergeant major , and he continued his studies at the school of artillery , military , and naval engineering in bucharest between 1911 and 1914 , he worked as technical manager of the bristol aeroplane company in the united kingdom , where he designed several aeroplanes known as the bristol-coanda monoplanes coandă 's research on the coandă effect was of interest post-war and became the basis for several investigations of entrained or augmented flow 1911 : an aircraft powered by two engines driving a single propeller 20 july 1916 flight – the configuration cancelled the torque of the engines
