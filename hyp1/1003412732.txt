in 1810 , masséna had followed the british-portuguese back to lisbon before arriving at the lines of torres vedras , but was determined to avoid storming the extensive double line of interlocking fortifications whilst wellington besieged almeida , masséna reformed his battered army and marched to relieve the french garrison in the city wellington chose to check the relief attempt at the small village of fuentes de oñoro , leaving his line of retreat exposed in order to cover all routes to almeida on 3 may , masséna launched a frontal assault against the british-portuguese pickets holding the barricaded village , while bombarding the british-portuguese on the heights east of the village with heavy artillery the fight in the center of the village lasted all that day , with french soldiers of ferey 's and marchand 's divisions clashing with the british redcoats of the 1st and 3rd divisions at first , the british-portuguese were driven back under immense pressure , but a charge that included men of the 71st highland light infantry reclaimed the streets and buildings lost earlier in the day masséna launched a heavy attack on the weak british-portuguese flank , led by montbrun 's dragoons and supported by the infantry divisions of marchand , mermet , and solignac time was of the essence and masséna at once sent one of his aide-de-camp , charles oudinot , the son of marshal duke of reggio , with orders to bring forward the guard cavalry the young oudinot hastily set off and masséna was impatiently checking his watch , pressed to commit this cavalry to what he believed was a decisive action of the battle oudinot had encountered the guard cavalry second-in-command , general louis lepic , who sharply refused to commit his men , saying that he only recognised the duke of istria ( bessières ) as commander and that without explicit orders from its commander , the guard horse grenadiers and dragoons would not draw their swords in a staggering display of treachery , bessières was absent from the field of battle , needlessly inspecting a series of ditches where the french army had passed a few days before low on ammunition , the french had to resort to the bayonet in a futile attempt to drive the british back wellington had repelled the army of portugal , inflicting a great number of casualties , and was able to continue his blockade of almeida '' glover , p.155 russian historian oleg sokolov noted that wellington had committed a serious strategic error by following the french into northern portugal , and that this decision could have had grievous consequences for the british-portuguese sokolov adds that , despite the various setbacks that he encountered before and during the battle , masséna was still able to check wellington 's position at fuentes de oñoro wellington himself did not mark the battle as a victory ; he also considered that he had unnecessarily extended his line , putting the 7th division and light division in danger '' glover , p.156 on reaching ciudad rodrigo , masséna was recalled to paris by a furious napoleon to explain his actions ( although napoleon had issued the order to return prior to the battle ) napoleonistyka the confusion came about because the hanoverian legion wore red coats , and in the smoke and heat of battle the finer details of uniforms that might have distinguished them from british line infantry were easily overlooked wellington commended his troops for their generosity after the battle , writing , '' the village of fuentes de oñoro having been the field of battle the other day , and not having been much improved by this circumstance , they immediately and voluntarily subscribed to raise a sum of money , to be given to the inhabitants as a compensation for the damage which their properties have sustained in the contest
