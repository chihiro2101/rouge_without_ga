the benedictine abbey of vézelay was founded , the primary source for the history of vézelay is a codex compiled in the twelfth century , containing the abbey 's annals , a cartulary , a history of the early counts of nevers , and much besides , in the bibliothèque municipale , auxerre , ms 227 ; it was edited by r in the 9th century , the abbey was refounded under the guidance of badilo , who became an affiliate of the reformed benedictine order of cluny vézelay also stood at the beginning of one of the four major routes through france for pilgrims going to santiago de compostela in galicia , in the north-western corner of spain about 1050 the monks of vézelay began to claim to hold the relics of mary magdalene , brought , they said , from the holy land either by their 9th-century founder-saint , badilo , or by envoys despatched by him a little later a monk of vézelay declared that he had detected in a crypt at st-maximin in provence , carved on an empty sarcophagus , a representation of the anointing of jesus , when jesus ' head was anointed by mary of bethany , who was assumed in the middle ages to be mary magdalene freed captives then brought their chains as votive objects to the abbey , and it was the newly elected abbot geoffroy in 1037 who had the ironwork melted down and reforged as wrought iron railings surrounding the magdalene 's altar thus the erection of one of the finest examples of romanesque architecture which followed was made possible by pilgrims to the declared relics and these tactile examples demonstrating the efficacy of prayers mary magdalene is the prototype of the penitent , and vézelay has remained an important place of pilgrimage for the roman catholic faithful , though the actual claimed relics were torched by huguenots in the 16th century to accommodate the influx of pilgrims a new abbey church was begun , dedicated on april 21 , 1104 , but the expense of building so increased the tax burden on the abbey 's lands that the peasants rose up and killed the abbot thomas becket , in exile , chose vézelay for his pentecost sermon in 1166 , announcing the excommunication of the main supporters of his english king , henry ii , and threatening the king with excommunication too the diocese of autun , who challenged its claims to exemption ; the counts of nevers , who claimed jurisdiction in their court and rights of hospitality at vézelay ; the abbey of cluny , which had reformed its rule and sought to maintain control of the abbot within its hierarchy ; the townsmen of vézelay , who demanded a modicum of communal self-government the beginning of vézelay 's decline coincided with the well-publicized discovery in 1279 of the body of mary magdalene at saint-maximin-la-sainte-baume in provence , given regal patronage by charles ii , the angevin king of sicily in 1834 the newly appointed french inspector of historical monuments , prosper mérimée ( more familiar as the author of carmen ) , warned that it was about to collapse , and on his recommendation the young architect eugène viollet-le-duc was appointed to supervise a massive and successful restoration , undertaken in several stages between 1840 and 1861 , during which his team replaced a great deal of the weathered and vandalized sculpture the art historian george zarnecki wrote , '' to most people the term romanesque sculpture brings to mind a large church portal , dominated by a tympanum carved with an apocalyptic vision , usually the last judgment in 1095 , urban altered his plans and preached for the first crusade at the council of clermont , but vézelay remained a central figure in the history of the crusades it is a depiction of the first pentecostal mission to spread the word of god to all the people of the world the vézelay lintel is distinct , but some comparisons can be made between it and other romanesque portal sculptures of the time in reference to the turkish take-over of the holy lands , pope urban said , '' what a disgrace that a race so despicable , degenerate , and enslaved by demons should thus overcome a people endowed with faith in almighty god ! '' it is not difficult to see the parallel between the apostles ' mission of casting out demons , and the designer 's view of the crusaders ' mission of casting out '' a race & nbsp ; that is why the traditional romanesque christ , with its angry stare , was replaced at vézelay by a kind and welcoming christ with arms wide open in 1976 , after more than eight centuries , hugues delautre , one of the franciscan fathers previously in charge of servicing the vézelay sanctuary , discovered that not only the orientation axis of la madeleine , but also its internal structure , were determined according to the position of the earth relative to the sun every year , just before the nativity of saint john the baptist , the astronomical dimensions of this church are revealed : when the sun reaches its highest point of the year , at noon on the summer solstice , the light coming through the southern clerestory windows casts a series of luminous spots precisely along the longitudinal center of the nave floor hugues delautre , solstices à vézelay , zodiaque n° 122 , abbaye sainte-marie de la pierre-qui-vire ( yonne ) , les ateliers de la pierre-qui-vire , dépôt légal 1240-3-79 , october 1979 , p 7 to 16 ( interview about the solstices lightings at vézelay ) cosmic architecture and the cult of light ) , translated in english , german , spanish , italian and dutch to understand the meaning of this objective sign , father hugues delautre refers to the 12th-century texts ( suger , peter the venerable , honorius of autun ) that inhabit the monument with the symbolic mentality of that time , for which sense reveals itself from sensitive signs through the anagogical method ( literally ascent towards the uncreated ) , and where one 's gaze is invited to go beyond the reality of the sign to reach the invisible , i.e letting himself be progressively informed by the vézelay light , he so concludes : : has not the builder , fascinated by the beauty of the universe which he recognises as the work of god , erected this vestibule to heaven in imitation of god who created with order , measure and beauty ? he could say as solomon did when he constructed the temple in jerusalem exactly according to god 's instructions : thou hast given command to build a temple on thy holy mountain
