in parallel-flow heat exchangers , the two fluids enter the exchanger at the same end , and travel in parallel to one another to the other side the counter current design is the most efficient , in that it can transfer the most heat from the heat ( transfer ) medium per unit mass due to the fact that the average temperature difference along any unit length is higher for efficiency , heat exchangers are designed to maximize the surface area of the wall between the two fluids , while minimizing resistance to fluid flow through the exchanger the exchanger 's performance can also be affected by the addition of fins or corrugations in one or both directions , which increase surface area and may channel fluid flow or induce turbulence however , since double pipe heat exchangers are simple , they are used to teach heat exchanger design basics to students as the fundamental rules for all heat exchangers are the same 1.double-pipe heat exchanger ( a ) when the other fluid flows into the annular gap between two tubes , one fluid flows through the smaller pipe 2.shell-and-tube heat exchanger the main constituents of this type of heat exchanger seem to be the tube box , shell , the front rear end headers , and baffles or fins the baffles are used to support the tubes , direct the fluid flow to the tubes in an approximately natural manner , and maximize the turbulence of the shell fluid there is many various kinds of baffles , and the choice of baffle form , spacing , and geometry depending on the allowable flow rate of the drop in shell-side force , the need for tube support , and the flow-induced vibrations in application to cool air with shell-and-tube technology ( such as intercooler / charge air cooler for combustion engines ) , fins can be added on the tubes to increase heat transfer area on air side and create a tubes & fins configuration to prevent a decrease in pressure in the movement of steam from the turbine to condenser , the condenser unit is placed underneath and connected to the turbine tube thickness : the thickness of the wall of the tubes is usually determined to ensure : there is enough room for corrosion that flow-induced vibration has resistance axial strength availability of spare parts hoop strength ( to withstand internal tube pressure ) buckling strength ( to withstand overpressure in the shell ) tube length : heat exchangers are usually cheaper when they have a smaller shell diameter and a long tube length however , there are many limitations for this , including space available at the installation site and the need to ensure tubes are available in lengths that are twice the required length ( so they can be withdrawn and replaced ) tube corrugation : this type of tubes , mainly used for the inner tubes , increases the turbulence of the fluids and the effect is very important in the heat transfer giving a better performance there are four main types of tube layout , which are , triangular ( 30° ) , rotated triangular ( 60° ) , square ( 90° ) and rotated square ( 45° ) the triangular patterns are employed to give greater heat transfer as they force the fluid to flow in a more turbulent fashion around the piping tubes & fins design : in application to cool air with shell-and-tube technology ( such as intercooler / charge air cooler for combustion engines ) , the difference in heat transfer between air and cold fluid can be such that there is a need to increase heat transfer area on air side in hvac applications , large heat exchangers of this type are called plate-and-frame ; when used in open loops , these heat exchangers are normally of the gasket type to allow periodic disassembly , cleaning , and inspection there are many types of permanently bonded plate heat exchangers , such as dip-brazed , vacuum-brazed , and welded plate varieties , and they are often specified for closed-loop applications such as refrigeration another difference between the two is that plate exchangers typically serve low to medium pressure fluids , compared to medium and high pressures of shell and tube a third type of heat exchanger is a plate and shell heat exchanger , which combines plate heat exchanger with shell and tube heat exchanger technologies a fourth type of heat exchanger uses an intermediate fluid or solid store to hold heat , which is then moved to the other side of the heat exchanger to be released two examples of this are adiabatic wheels , which consist of a large wheel with fine threads rotating through the hot and cold fluids , and fluid heat exchangers advantages of plate and fin heat exchangers : high heat transfer efficiency especially in gas treatment larger heat transfer area approximately 5 times lighter in weight than that of shell and tube heat exchanger after welding the enclosed space is pressurised with sufficient force to cause the thin metal to bulge out around the welds , providing a space for heat exchanger liquids to flow , and creating a characteristic appearance of a swelled pillow formed out of metal this is a heat exchanger with a gas passing upwards through a shower of fluid ( often water ) , and the fluid is then taken elsewhere before being cooled a waste heat recovery unit ( whru ) is a heat exchanger that recovers heat from a hot gas stream while transferring it to a working medium , typically water or oils thumb thumb in addition to heating up or cooling down fluids in just a single phase , heat exchangers can be used either to heat a liquid to evaporate ( or boil ) it or used as condensers to cool a vapor and condense it to a liquid in the nuclear power plants called pressurized water reactors , special large heat exchangers pass heat from the primary ( reactor plant ) system to the secondary ( steam plant ) system , producing steam from water in the process air pollution control orientation course from website of the air pollution training institute energy savings in steam systems figure 3a , layout of surface condenser ( scroll to page 11 of 34 pdf pages ) to conserve energy and cooling capacity in chemical and other plants , regenerative heat exchangers can transfer heat from a stream that must be cooled to another stream that must be heated , such as distillate cooling and reboiler feed pre-heating direct contact heat exchangers involve heat transfer between hot and cold streams of two phases in the absence of a separating wall thus such heat exchangers can be classified as : gas – liquid immiscible liquid – liquid solid-liquid or solid – gas most direct contact heat exchangers fall under the gas – liquid category , where heat is transferred between a gas and liquid in the form of drops , films or sprays such types of heat exchangers are used predominantly in air conditioning , humidification , industrial hot water heating , water cooling and condensing plants _1 is known as the log mean temperature difference , and is a measure of the effectiveness of the heat exchanger in transferring heat energy architectural engineering chemical engineering cooling tower copper in heat exchangers heat pipe heat pump heat recovery ventilation jacketed vessel log mean temperature difference ( lmtd ) marine heat exchangers mechanical engineering micro heat exchanger moving bed heat exchanger packed bed and in particular packed columns pumpable ice technology reboiler recuperator , or cross plate heat exchanger regenerator run around coil steam generator ( nuclear power ) surface condenser toroidal expansion joint thermosiphon thermal wheel , or rotary heat exchanger ( including enthalpy wheel and desiccant wheel ) tube tool waste heat heat transfer and mass transfer- volume 1 ;
