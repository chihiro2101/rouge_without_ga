constitutional monarchy was the most viable solution for ending the revolution with a minimum of further bloodshed he was denounced on 15 august 1792 in the legislative assembly , arrested and imprisoned for ten months in grenoble , then transferred to fort barraux ( also called fort saint-barthélémy ) , near barraux in the isère department , and in november 1793 to paris ( during the reign of terror ) his sympathy and relations with the royal family , to whom he had submitted a plan for a counter-revolution , and his desire to check the violence of the revolution , brought on him suspicion of treason he soon rose to prominence in the national assembly , becoming the friend of most of the leaders of the party originating in the third estate , and formed with adrien duport and alexandre lameth the group known during the constituent assembly as '' the triumvirate '' at time of the arrest of louis xvi and the royal family during the flight to varennes , barnave was one of the three appointed to bring them back to paris , together with jérôme pétion de villeneuve and the charles césar de fay de la tour-maubourg barnave took part in the conference on the claims of the three orders , drew up the first address to king louis xvi , and supported the proposal of emmanuel joseph sieyès that the assembly should declare itself '' national '' barnave was prepared for a career in law , and at the age of twenty-two made himself known by a speech pronounced before the local parlement , the parlement du dauphiné , also known as parlement de grenoble , on the separation of powers until 1791 , he was one of the preeminent members of the club known later as the jacobin club , of which he drew up the manifesto and first rulebook 229 barnave 's argument , that “ just as landed property is the basis of aristocracy and federalism , commercial property is the principle of democracy and unity ” , quoted in r meek , social science and the ignoble savage ( cambridge 1976 ) p subject to the more radical forces , barnave took part in the attacks on the monarchy , on the clergy , on roman catholic church property , and on the provincial parlements a few months later he became better known , when the estates-general of 1789 convened in versailles on 5 may 1789 , and barnave was chosen to be a deputy of the third estate for his native province of dauphiné esprit des édits , enregistrés militairement , le 10 mai 1788 19 pages , french he was immediately elected deputy , with his father , to the estates general ( france ) , and played a prominent role in their debates he believed that her support would improve the public opinion on the royal family by preventing her brother , the emperor of austria , from invading france and imposing upon it an absolute monarchy that conflicted with the ideals of the french revolution after the storming of the bastille , barnave argued that violence lead the french citizens to their desired goals – the start of the revolution and constitutional change a critical dictionary of the french revolution ( 1989 ) , pp his conflict with mirabeau on the question of assigning to the king the right to make peace or war ( from 16 to 23 may 1790 ) was one of the main episodes of the assembly 's mandate a few weeks later , in early july 1791 , marie antoinette wrote to barnave the first of a long series of cryptic letters ) , companion to the history of the french revolution ( wiley-blackwell , 2013 ) , 263–77 he felt that a constitutional monarchy would solve the problems facing france without being a complete upheaval of the government , although it does not mean that he was entirely in favor of the monarchy on the occasion of the death of mirabeau , which occurred on 2 april 1791 , barnave paid a high tribute to his worth and public services , designating him the '' william shakespeare of oratory '' together these three would later be principal figures in the formation of the feuillants , the breakaway party from the jacobin club dedicated to a moderate course supporting constitutional monarchy passing the civil constitution of the clergy would lawfully impose church adherence to the king and the nation of france by having the state pay them salaries for their service and holding popular elections for the priests and bishops being in favor of a new system of government , barnave spoke passionately about terminating the powerful influence of religious authorities and allocating that role in government to the people of france to barnave , allocating the appropriated land of the church among the french people would help abate the economic burden and starvation in the country as the jacobin club grew more radically in favor of a republic , barnave and the other two members of the triumvirate broke away from it and formed the feuillant political group on 18 july 1791 in august 1790 , after a vehement debate , he fought a duel with jacques antoine marie de cazalès , in which the latter was slightly wounded much evidence indicates that , because her closest friends , including count von fersen , who had organized the flight from paris , were absent , marie antoinette was attempting to influence barnave and his fellow feuillants as a way to ensure her family 's safety
