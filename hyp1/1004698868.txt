kayton , fried 1977 , p.116 by tuning in a radio station and then using a directional antenna , one could determine the direction to the broadcasting antenna commercial am radio stations can be used for this task due to their long range and high power , but strings of low-power radio beacons were also set up specifically for this task , especially near airports and harbours at most angles the loop has a fairly flat reception pattern , but when it is aligned perpendicular to the station the signal received on one side of the loop cancels the signal in the other , producing a sharp drop in reception known as the '' null '' by rotating the loop and looking for the angle of the null , the relative bearing of the station can be determined a smaller problem is that the accuracy of the system is based to a degree on the size of the antenna , but larger antennas would likewise make the installation more difficult by timing the delay between the morse signal and the peak/null , then dividing by the known rotational rate of the station , the bearing of the station could be calculated combined with the introduction of the transistor and integrated circuit , rdf systems were so reduced in size and complexity that they once again became quite common during the 1960s , and were known by the new name , automatic direction finder , or adf vhf omnidirectional range , or vor , is an implementation of the reverse-rdf system , but one that is more accurate and able to be completely automated the vor station transmits two audio signals on a vhf carrier – one is at 1020 & nbsp ; hz which is morse code to identify the station , the other is a continuous 9960 & nbsp ; hz audio signal frequency modulated at 30 & nbsp ; hz , with the 0-degree referenced to magnetic north this signal is rotated mechanically or electrically at 30 & nbsp ; hz , which appears as a 30 & nbsp ; hz am signal added to the previous two signals , the phasing of which is dependent on the position of the aircraft relative to the vor station conversion from this audio signal into a usable navigation aid is done by a navigation converter , which takes the reference signal and compares the phasing with the variable signal station identification is known by listening to the audio directly , as the 9960 & nbsp ; hz and 30 & nbsp ; hz signals are filtered out of the aircraft internal communication system , leaving only the 1020 & nbsp ; hz morse-code station identification these systems were common in the era when electronics were large and expensive , as they placed minimum requirements on the receivers – they were simply voice radio sets tuned to the selected frequencies in the post-world war i era , the lorenz company of germany developed a means of projecting two narrow radio signals with a slight overlap in the center the first widespread radio navigation network , using low and medium frequencies , was instead led by the us ( see lff , below ) bombers would enter one of the beams and use it for guidance until they heard the second one in a second radio receiver , using that signal to time the dropping of their bombs the low-frequency radio range ( lfr , also '' four course radio range '' among other names ) was the main navigation system used by aircraft for instrument flying in the 1930s and 1940s in the u.s the borders between these quadrants created four course legs or '' beams '' and if the pilot flew down these lines , the '' a '' and '' n '' signal merged into a steady '' on course '' tone and the pilot was '' on the beam '' if the pilot deviated to either side the '' a '' or '' n '' tone would become louder and the pilot knew to make a correction the beams were typically aligned with other stations to produce a set of airways , allowing an aircraft to travel from airport to airport by following a selected set of stations the introduction of radar in the 1930s provided a way to directly determine the distance to an object even at long distances when the signal reflects off a target , some of that signal is reflected back in the direction of the station , where it is received amplified signals from the receiver are then sent to the y input , where any received reflection causes the beam to move upward on the display by measuring the distance from the start of the sweep to the blip , which corresponds to the time between broadcast and reception , the distance to the object can be determined transponders are a combination of receiver and transmitter whose operation is automated – upon reception of a particular signal , normally a pulse on a particular frequency , the transponder sends out a pulse in response , typically delayed by some very short time transponders were initially used as the basis for early iff systems ; aircraft with the proper transponder would appear on the display as part of the normal radar operation , but then the signal from the transponder would cause a second blip to appear a short time later as the distance between the broadcaster and receiver grows , the area covered by the fan increases , decreasing the accuracy of location within it in comparison , transponder-based systems measure the timing between two signals , and the accuracy of that measure is largely a function of the equipment and nothing else to ease pilot workload only one of these was used for navigation – prior to the mission a circle was drawn over the target from one of the stations , and the aircraft was directed to fly along this circle on instructions from the ground operator the asv radar introduced by raf coastal command was designed to track down submarines and ships by displaying the signal from two antennas side by side and allowing the operator to compare their relative strength the us quickly adopted the system for paratroop operations , dropping the eureka with pathfinder forces or partisans , and then homing in on those signals to mark the drop zones these systems allowed the troops at the front line to direct the aircraft to points in front of them , directing fire on the enemy beacons were widely used for temporary or mobile navigation as well , as the transponder systems were generally small and low-powered , able to be man portable or mounted on a jeep dme was identical to gee-h in concept , but used new electronics to automatically measure the time delay and display it as a number , rather than having the operator time the signals manually on an oscilloscope if the signal from two stations arrived at the same time , the aircraft must be an equal distance from both transmitters , allowing the navigator to determine a line of position on his chart of all the positions at that distance from both stations by the 1980s , this had been further reduced to the size of a conventional radio , and it became common even on pleasure boats and personal aircraft it was the most popular navigation system in use through the 1980s and 90s , and its popularity led to many older systems being shut down , like gee and decca satellite navigation systems send several signals that are used to decode the satellite 's position , distance between the user satellite , and the user 's precise time satellite navigation systems offer better accuracy than any land-based system , are available at almost all locations on the earth , can be implemented ( receiver-side ) a modest cost and complexity , with modern electronics , and require only a few dozen satellites to provide worldwide coverage itu radio regulations , chapter ii – frequencies , article 5 frequency allocations , section iv – table of frequency allocations in order to improve harmonisation in spectrum utilisation , the majority of service-allocations stipulated in this document were incorporated in national tables of frequency allocations and utilisations which is within the responsibility of the appropriate national administration
