however , due to buffering of the digital broadcast on some computers , this signal may be delayed as much as 20 seconds from the actual start of the hour ( this is presumably the same situation for all cbs radio stations , as each station 's digital stream is produced and distributed in a similar manner ) , though unlike program content which is on a broadcast delay for content concerns , the time signal airs as-is over-the-air , meaning it can sometimes be talked over during a live news event or sports play-by-play a march 1905 issue of the technical world describes the role of the united states naval observatory as a source of time signals : : one of the most important functions of the naval observatory is found in the daily distribution of the correct time to every portion of the united states kenneth seidelmann time : from earth rotation to atomic physics , wiley-vch , 2009 , page 256 radio time signal stations broadcast the time in both audible and machine-readable time code form that can be used as references for radio clocks and radio-controlled watches the electrical impulse which goes forth from the observatory at noon each day , now sets or regulates automatically more than 70,000 clocks located in all parts of the united states , and also serves , in each of the larger cities of the country , to release a time-ball located on some lofty building of central location in many midwestern us cities where tornadoes are a common hazard , the emergency sirens are tested regularly at a specified time ( say , noon each saturday ) ; while not primarily intended to mark the time , local people often check their watches when they hear this signal the time announcements are normally delayed by less than 30 ms when using land lines from within the continental united states , and the stability ( delay variation ) is generally in the united states many information-based radio stations ( full-service , all-news and news/talk ) also broadcast time signals at the beginning of the hour thus , network-generated time signals and service cues will also be delayed by about eight seconds ( for this reason , when wben-am in buffalo , new york was broadcasting time markers and was simulcast on an fm station that broadcast in hd , the fm signal did not carry the time signal ; wben does not broadcast in hd ) the all-news radio stations of the cbs radio network , of which wcbs is the flagship , air a '' bong '' ( at a frequency of 440 & nbsp ; hz , the a440 ( pitch standard ) ) that immediately precedes each top-of-the-hour network newscast the dropping of the time-ball – accompanied , at some points , with the simultaneous firing of a cannon – is the signal for the regulation by hand of hundreds of other clocks and watches in the vicinity american practical navigator car radio , radio data system ( rds ) clock signal extended data services and pbs greenwich time signal low frequency , ( lf ) smart personal objects technology , ( spot ) speaking clock synchronization vbi , vitc wwvb time synchronization in north america time transfer time and frequency transfer time synchronization this included a system for synchronising the drop of the time ball at greenwich with other time balls around the country , one of which was on top of the electric 's offices in the strand stations operating in the shortwave band can cover wider areas with relatively low-power transmitters , but the varying distance that the signal travels increases the uncertainty of the time signal on a scale of milliseconds the cbc 's predecessor , the cnr radio , broadcast the time signal over its cbo-fm , cnro ( originally ckch ) , at 9 pm daily and also on its moncton station , cnra , beginning in 1923 the telegraphic distribution of time signals was made obsolete by the use of am , fm , shortwave radio , internet network time protocol servers as well as atomic clocks in satellite navigation systems the original object of this time service was to furnish mariners in the seaboard cities with the means of regulating their chronometers ; but , like many another governmental activity , its scope has gradually broadened until it has become of general usefulness a number of accurate audible or visible time signals were established in many seaport cities to enable navigators to set their chronometers accurate knowledge of time of day is essential for navigation , and ships carried the most accurate marine chronometers available , although they did not keep perfect time in australia , many information-based radio stations broadcast time signals at the beginning of the hour , and a speaking clock service was also available until october 2019
