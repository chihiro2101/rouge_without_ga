the g.i was designed to serve on the heavier end of the spectrum of heavy fighters , as a jachtkruiser or a bomber destroyer , and was comparable to early models of the german messerschmitt bf 110 in 1934 , the french ministry of air issued a specification for a new two or three-seat multi-role fighter , capable of functioning as a bomber escort and night fighter , as well as providing fighter direction ( leading formations of single-engine fighters to their targets ) rickard , j ( 19 may 2011 ) , potez 630 , the basic design was extremely close to the original specification ; that of either a 2 or 3 seat , dual-engine heavy fighter , armed with two 20 & nbsp ; mm hispano-suiza hs.404 cannons in gondolas under the fuselage and a rearward-facing machine gun for defense the day/night fighter variant , the potez 631 , had quickly proved to be an ineffectual interceptor ; it was slower than some german bomber aircraft and 130 & nbsp ; km/h slower than the messerschmitt bf 109 e-variant fighter one factor contributing to the high losses was the near-complete lack of spares , rendering 70 63.11s unserviceable even prior to the german invasion ; many aircraft were destroyed on the ground by enemy bombing and strafing attacks , and entire units were wiped out without conducting a single mission rickard , j ( 2 october 2009 ) , bréguet 690 , by 1938 , with france falling behind in ground-attack/close-air support aircraft , the decision was made by the air force to re-designate the bréguet 690 as the bréguet 691 , and to utilize it as a ground-attack aircraft six to eight were shot down by german flak , two more 693s were lost while attempting to return to base , and of those that made it home safely , one was written off ( most of the twenty four crewmen survived or were captured alive , although three died during the attack and some of the survivors were badly wounded ) as the fighting drew to a close the french attempted to fly as many 693s as possible to north africa , but only three made the flight , and none were used by the vichy air force in north africa a major heavy fighter design was the messerschmitt bf 110 , a german fighter that , prior to the war , was considered by the german luftwaffe more important than their single-engine fighters it served well against the hawker hurricane during the battle of france , but was easily outperformed by – and up to 50 & nbsp ; km/h ( 31 & nbsp ; mph ) slower in top speed than – the supermarine spitfire during the battle of britain eventually bf 110s were converted to interceptors , and were particularly successful in the later marks of the bf 110g series from 1942/3 onwards as night fighters , serving as the primary aircraft of the luftwaffe nachtjagdgeschwader night fighter wings , using various versions of the lichtenstein radar for nocturnal interception of raf bomber command heavy bombers , as well as finding some use as ground-attack aircraft the me 210 and me 410 hornisse were all-new aircraft designs meant to replace the bf 110 , but also could not outrun contemporary single-engine fighters , with the me 210 having serious aerodynamic problems from mistakes in the design of its wing planform and the initial design of its rear fuselage aside from the bf 110 and me 210/410 , the luftwaffe also utilized various light bombers , medium bombers , and schnellbombers ( german ; literally '' fast bomber '' ) in the heavy fighter role towards the end of the war , the dornier do 335 could have been an ideal twin-engine zerstörer fighter design for the luftwaffe due to its push-pull configuration , which placed its fuselage-mounted twin db 603 engines ' propellers on opposing ends of the fuselage , and potentially allowed much better maneuverability , while essentially using the same engines as the conventional-layout twin-engine me 410 the centre-line thrust design of the do 335 , the first-ever front-line combat fighter to use it , did allow dramatically higher speeds ( just over 750 & nbsp ; km/h or 465 & nbsp ; mph ) than any other twin-piston-engine aircraft of its era , but was never produced in quantity apart from the westland whirlwind and the high-altitude welkin , both built only in modest numbers ( the former due to lack of engines , the latter due to changed requirement ) , the royal air force 's wartime twin-engined fighters were all adapted from contemporary bombers during the battle of britain , bristol blenheim bombers were fitted , as an interim measure and in utmost secrecy , with radars and ventral gun packs , turning them into the raf 's first night fighters more successful was the bristol beaufighter , started in 1938 as an interim aircraft to cover for delays in introduction of a cannon-armed fighter ( the westland whirlwind ) 303 inch ( 7.7 mm ) machine guns , four 20 & nbsp ; mm cannon and rockets , bombs or torpedoes , the beaufighter was potent in the anti-ship and ground attack role in the pacific and europe during the war the curtis xp-71 project was a long range escort fighter/bomber destroyer design based on 75mm gun ( the same as intended for the lockheed xp-58 ) but interest waned and the span aircraft did not progress beyond the mockup buttler , t and griffith , a american secret projects : fighters bombers and attack aircraft 1937 to 1945 p 73-74 another bomber destroyer was the beech model 28 with a 75 & nbsp ; mm gun and twin turrets for defence buttler and griffith , p144 the us military never designated an aircraft as a '' heavy fighter , '' but some american fighters were relatively heavy in weight it was designed as a twin-engine bomber interceptor to climb quickly and carry heavy armament at high speed , with the lighter bell p-39 airacobra meeting the single-engine version of the same requirement during the interwar period the ussr , as with many other nations , set about developing twin-engine fighters with recoilless rifle armament to function in the heavy-fighter role , particularly as interceptors and bomber destroyers with the operation barbarossa in 1941 , the soviet air forces were caught off-guard ; with only lighter , single-engined , relatively lightly-armed fighters to intercept luftwaffe bombers , and no dedicated night fighters ( a role typically filled by heavy fighters ) the regiment 's experiences revealed further deficiencies not found during initial testing ; firing the aircraft 's forward-facing armament at night temporarily blinded the pilots , crews complained about a lack of frontal armor , and heavier armament was requested all were developed at the end of world war & nbsp ; ii for use in the pacific theatre , though none reached operational squadrons until after vj day , the hornet in 1946 , the sea hornet in 1947 and the twin mustang in 1948 they typically also have more capable and complex radar and electronic systems , with the result that in older air-superiority fighters such as the mcdonnell douglas f-4 phantom ii or grumman f-14 tomcat , a second dedicated crew member was carried to manage radar and weapon-systems
