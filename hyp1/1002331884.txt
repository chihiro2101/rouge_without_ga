'' despite his own unique teaching on baptism his own account is noteworthy for the absence of any mention of the process of laying on of hands or a special prayer in the dispensation of the holy spirit , which were considered fundamental for membership in the worldwide church of god and reason for many a new convert 's rebaptism '' baptism and ordination of herbert w armstrong '' while a member of the church of god ( seventh day ) , armstrong became acquainted with ministers john kiesz and israel hager who began to suspect that herbert was a little too arrogant and tended to go against church doctrine dodd , both of which had composed a book called a history of the true religion , from 33 ad to date , in which they claimed that the new testament church of the first century had secretly descended through history and eventually became the sabbath-keeping church of god ( seventh day ) eventually , this led to dugger and dodd 's ouster and when they promised to make armstrong an apostle in their new church , the church of god ( seventh day ) , he joined with them after severing ties with the church of god ( seventh day ) as the result of doctrinal disputes , he began to teach a form of british israelism , which would later make up his book united states in prophecy for example , a statement from a lead article in the february 1939 edition of the plain truth , about a coming world war , said this : by way of brief review of previous articles , and radio messages , notice , first , that this war will involve all nations during the 1950s and 1960s , the church continued to expand and the radio program was broadcast in england , australia , the philippines , latin america , and africa several books and booklets focused on the key events that would signal the imminence of christ 's return , and taught of a specific end-time prophecy to be fulfilled , manifested in the form of european peacekeeping forces surrounding jerusalem , at which time god 's church would be taken to a place of protection , or '' place of safety '' —possibly petra in jordan in this book , armstrong makes the claim that the peoples of the united states , the british commonwealth nations , and the nations of northwestern europe are descendants of the ten lost tribes of israel franz josef strauss , a major politician in post-wwii germany , became the target of the broadcasting and publishing media blitz that armstrong unleashed upon europe through the daily offshore pirate radio station broadcasts by his son garner ted armstrong , the plain truth , and the ambassador college campus at bricket wood in hertfordshire , england after initially changing his behavior he returned , but these issues resurfaced , coupled with his challenging his father 's authority as pastor general , resulting in him being permanently '' disfellowshipped '' ( the church 's term for excommunication ) in 1978 these humanitarian projects led to armstrong receiving a series of invitations to meet with prominent heads of state , including ( among others ) margaret thatcher , emperor hirohito of japan , king hussein of jordan , and indira gandhi '' in his latter years , armstrong stated that he did not know whether or not christ would return in his lifetime but did know , based on the sequence of events in the bible , that the lord 's return was approaching in the years after his death in 1986 , wcg leaders came to the conclusion that many of armstrong 's theological arguments were not biblical , causing the church to reject his teachings as '' aberrant '' and to completely rewrite its doctrines in april 2009 , in light of the major doctrinal shifts made , the church also changed its name to grace communion international ( gci ) to better reflect its new teachings armstrong taught a form of sabbatarianism , explaining that ; by creating the sabbath ( on the seventh day of creation , through resting – not working ) god '' hallowed the seventh-day of every week ( ex to be enjoyed , to spiritually refresh , in blessed fellowship and communion with christ !

'' circa 1972 armstrong preached that jesus christ will return to earth to '' rescue '' humanity from the brink of self-annihilation , resulting in the establishment of '' god 's government '' upon earth , during a 'millennium ' period , under the rulership of christ and first-resurrected saints '' christ is in heaven '' until '' the '' times of restitution '' ( acts 3:19–21 ) when god 's government , world peace and utopian conditions shall be restored to this earth he believed that those who die as unbelievers prior to the return of christ , exist in a state of '' unconsciousness '' ( see soul sleep ) until after the 'millennium ' at the second resurrection , during which they will be offered the choice to submit to god 's government he believed that the holy spirit was part of god 's essence , a power emanating from him that suffused all creation , and especially believers , and through which god was omnipresent and able to act at all places and at all times because of his teachings identifying both the primacy of sabbath and the '' identity of modern israel '' , armstrong would come to accept that the mosaic law had not been '' done away '' although he excluded certain segments he regarded as '' already fulfilled '' , '' ceremonial '' or otherwise unfit , he taught adherence to the levitical food regulations and the observance of the '' holy days '' of the mosaic law armstrong , pagan holidays – or god 's holy days – which , p.26 the worldwide church of god taught seven 'festivals of god ' ( passover , days of unleavened bread , pentecost , feast of trumpets , day of atonement , feast of tabernacles , last great day ) and regarded such to be 'worship ' days including sukkot or '' feast of tabernacles armstrong placed much emphasis on faith in god for healing and taught against the medical practice , except in the case of '' repair '' ( setting of broken bones , cleansing of wounds , etc armstrong spoke highly of principles of good diet ( outside of the levitical food regulations ) and proper living , and members of the worldwide church of god as a result tended to gravitate towards whole grains , home-grown vegetables etc armstrong and the worldwide church of god viewed revelation 2 and 3 , ( which contains seven messages to seven churches in asia minor at the time of its writing ) , to also be descriptive of seven '' church eras '' to pass , in chronological order he stated that the '' sardis '' era ended with his severance from the church of god ( seventh-day ) and that the '' philadelphia '' era officially began in october 1933 this concept has assumed greater importance among current wcg splinter groups , as those that practice armstrong 's teachings tend to view the modern worldwide church of god ( and sometimes other splinter groups ) as '' laodicean '' or entirely protestant the first tithe ( 10 % of member 's gross household income ) went to the worldwide church of god organization , which viewed itself as the '' melchizedek priesthood '' with jesus christ as the high priest with the rank of melchizedek , which priesthood superseded the levitical priesthood , and thereby entitled to support by tithes salvation : armstrong believed that repentance , faith and the indwelling of god 's holy spirit enables true and full obedience to god 's law , but stressed that keeping god 's law ( and repentance upon having sinned ) is a requirement for salvation the covenants : armstrong taught that the new covenant is an 'amplification ' of the old covenant , and that certain laws ( excluding temple and unenforceable ancient civil laws ) from the old covenant are still in effect for christians gospel of the kingdom : armstrong taught that a reason for jesus christ 's presence on earth was to proclaim the gospel message of a literal kingdom of god that will be established on earth at christ 's 'second coming ' , and that the message of the kingdom should be the focus of the gospel rather than the person of christ armstrong taught that – the gospel '' of '' christ – began to change to – a gospel '' about '' christ – around twenty to thirty years after the founding of the church in 31 a.d he made the extraordinary claim that the gospel christ brought ( of the kingdom ) had '' not been proclaimed to the world '' for about 1,900 years '' until the first week in 1953 '' when he began preaching it again on radio luxembourg armstrong was considered gifted with spiritual understanding also and that , through him , god was revealing the true meaning of parts of the bible which , till his time , had remained locked or sealed ( so could not be correctly understood ) that desire for understanding had been with armstrong since he was a small boy , '' always wanting to know 'why ? ' or 'how ? ' that obsession for understanding was to have a great influence on founding the plain truth magazine and ambassador college in later years british israelism : armstrong taught a form of british israelism , which is the belief that those of western european descent , notably england ( ephraim ) and the united states ( manasseh ) , are direct descendants of the ancient northern kingdom of israel armstrong stated god 's church , the now imminent bride of christ , is not going to rise to meet the returning christ in the air with painted faces and plucked and repainted eyebrows ! how cleverly , without our suspecting it , did satan influence leading ministers to derail the church in many ways ! as the bible teaches that '' the body is the temple of god 's spirit , '' armstrong believed that it should therefore be kept in good health and presented in a manner glorifying to christ armstrong concluded that a third resurrection would take place , in which the incorrigibly wicked and those who had been converted ( baptized members of wcg ) but had 'fallen away ' ( left wcg ) and who also had not repented in the '' great tribulation '' would be resurrected and sentenced to eternal death in the 'lake of fire order of the sacred treasure , from the japanese government king albert i a watch ( one of four specially commissioned by king albert , after the armistice , to be made from an iron cannonball ) , presented by his majesty leopold iii of belgium in november 1970 , for most significant contribution toward world peace ; ambassador foundation presents herbert w 4 ( 1983 ) armstrong was also a founding board member of the king leopold iii foundation for the conservation of nature presidential merit medal , presented by president marcos of the philippines in 1983 in the manila presidential palace ambassador foundation presents herbert w 30 and 31 ( 1983 ) the cross of constantine , presented by the patriarch of jerusalem diodoras in 1982 in jerusalem honorary doctorates in humanities from both iloilo university and angeles university in the philippines herbert w pagan holidays—or god 's holy days—which ? proof of the bible the incredible human potential the missing dimension in sex the seven laws of success the united states and britain in prophecy the wonderful world tomorrow what is faith ? what science ca n't discover about the human mind who or what is the prophetic beast ? why marriage – soon obsolete ?
