software synthesizers can have more advanced algorithms than digital hardware synthesizers due to the much greater processing speed ( as well as support for floating point processing and greater than 24-bit word size ) of the x86-64 cpus that modern music production personal computers have over the digital signal processors found in common hardware synthesizers image : cubase 6 feature - software instruments and software effects.svg thumb top : software instruments bottom : software effect processors on cubase 6 a software instrument can be a synthesized version of a real instrument ( like the sounds of a violin or drums ) , or a unique instrument , generated by computer software the advantage to dedicated hardware is that it can be more stable , and also that it often has a user interface that is physical ( knobs and sliders ) and therefore easier to manipulate during performances : category : software synthesizers : category : music software plugin architectures digital audio editor modular synthesizer music sequencer digital audio workstation sound module synthesizer synthfont timidity++ video game music list of music software plugin softsynths require a host application such as a digital audio workstation , which records the music that is played however modern professional audio interfaces can frequently operate with extremely low latency , so in recent years this has become much less of a problem than in the early days of computer music when the soft synthesizer is running as a plug-in for a host sequencer , both the soft synth and the sequencer are competing for processor time the advantage of offline synthesis is that the software can spend as much time as it needs to generate the resulting sounds , potentially increasing sound quality the integrated processors included in mobile phones have become so fast , that synthesizer applications ( apps ) can play with the same capabilities as the classic analog or digital synths also of note is software like csound and nyquist , which can be used to program software instruments popular synthesizers such as the minimoog , yamaha dx7 , korg m1 , prophet-5 , oberheim ob-x , roland jupiter 8 , arp 2600 and dozens of other classics have been recreated in software software instruments have been made popular by the convergence of synthesizers and computers , as well as sequencing software like garageband , logic pro ( geared toward professionals ) , the open source project audacity , and ableton live which is geared towards live performances
