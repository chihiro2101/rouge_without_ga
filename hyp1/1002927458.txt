sefer yetzirah describes how the universe was created by the '' god of israel '' ( a list of all of god 's hebrew names appears in the first sentence of the book ) through '' 32 wondrous ways of wisdom '' : ten numbers ( sefirot , the origin for the sefirot of later kabbalah ) the twenty-two letters of the hebrew alphabet— three '' mother '' letters ( aleph , mem , shin ) seven '' doubles '' ( bet , gimel , dalet , kaph , pe , resh , taw ) twelve '' simples '' or '' elementals '' ( he , waw , zayin , heth , teth , yodh , lamedh , nun , samekh , ayin , tsade , qoph ) these divisions correspond to jewish concepts such as the 3 letters making up god 's name ( yud , he , and vav ) , the 7 days of the jewish week , the 12 tribes of israel , and the 12 months of the hebrew calendar , as well as to early '' scientific '' or philosophical ideas such as the 4 elements ( fire , water , air , earth ) , the 7 planets , 10 directions , the 12 zodiacal constellations , various human physical functions , and a list of the parts of the human body as in the latter , god is not only the beginning but also the end of all things , so in the former he is the ἀρχή ( ראשית ) and τέλος ( תכלית ) of all that exists ; and the clementine writings furthermore teach that the spirit of god is transformed into πνεῦμα ( רוח ) , and this into water , which becomes fire and rocks , thus agreeing with the sefer yetzirah , where the spirit of god , רוח ( πνεῦμα ) , air , water , and fire are the first four sefirot god 's covenant with abraham is described as being two-fold : between the 10 toes of the feet is the '' covenant of the circumcision '' ( mila in hebrew , which also means '' word '' ) between the 10 fingers of the hands ( also identified with the 10 sephirot ) is the '' covenant of the tongue '' ( lashon in hebrew , which also means '' language '' ) the last sentence describes how god '' connects '' the 22 letters of the torah to abraham 's tongue , and reveals its secret to abraham 3 ) the letters are distinguished , moreover , by the intensity of the sound necessary to produce them , and are accordingly divided into : mutes , which are unaccompanied by sound , such as mem sibilants , such as shin , which is therefore called the '' hissing shin '' aspirates , such as aleph , which holds a position between the mutes and sibilants , and is designated as the '' airy aleph , which holds the balance in the middle '' ( iv both the macrocosm ( the universe ) and the microcosm ( man ) are viewed in this system as products of the combination and permutation of these mystic characters , and such a use of the letters by the jews for the formation of the holy name for thaumaturgy purposes is attested by magic papyri that quote an '' angelic book of moses , '' which was full of allusions to bible names an intimate relation exists between the sefer yetzirah and the later mystics ; and although there is a marked difference between the later kabbalah and the sefer yetzirah ( for instance , the sefirot of the kabbalists do not correspond to those of the sefer yetzirah ) , the system laid down in the latter is the first visible link in the development of kabbalistic ideas hence the formation of the letters is described as follows : with the tip of the tongue and the throat between the lips and the tip of the tongue in the middle of the tongue by the tip of the tongue by the tongue , which lies flat and stretched , and by the teeth ( ii 1 ) besides these three letters , which are called '' mothers , '' a distinction is also drawn between the seven '' double '' letters , which have two different sounds according to inflection , and the twelve '' simple '' letters , the remaining characters of the alphabet which represent only one sound each in addition to the doctrine of the sefirot and the letters , the theory of contrasts in nature , or of the syzygies ( '' pairs '' ) , as they are called by the gnostics , occupies a prominent place in the sefer yetzirah the three seasons of the year , winter , summer , and the rainy season , correspond to water , fire , and ruach in the same way as man consists of a head ( corresponding to fire ) , torso ( represented by ruach ) , and the other parts of the body ( equivalent to water ) the '' dragon '' ( תלי tli , perhaps meaning '' curled one '' as a coiled serpent ) which plays such an important part in the astrology of the book , is probably an ancient semitic figure ; at all events its name is not arabic , as scholars have hitherto assumed , but either aramaic or possibly a babylonian loan-word in the beginning , however , these three substances had only a potential existence , and came into actual being only by means of the three letters aleph , mem , shin ; and as these are the principal parts of speech , so those three substances are the elements from which the cosmos has been formed while the sefirot are expressly designated as '' abstracts '' , it is said of the letters : '' twenty-two letters : god drew them , hewed them , combined them , weighed them , interchanged them , and through them produced the whole creation and everything that is destined to come into being '' ( ii according to the jewish encyclopedia , the essential elements of the book are characteristic of the 3rd or 4th century ; for a work of this nature , composed in the geonim period could have been cast only in the form of jewish gnosis , which remained stationary after the 4th century , if indeed it had not already become extinct the three letters aleph , mem , shin , are not only the three '' mothers '' from which the other letters of the alphabet are formed , but they are also symbolical figures for the three primordial elements , the substances which underlie all existence the remaining six sefirot , or the limitations of space by the three dimensions in a twofold direction , are also found in the clementina , where god is described as the boundary of the universe and as the source of the six infinite dimensions the latter are those organs which perform functions in the body independent of the outside world , being the hands , feet , kidneys , gall , intestines , stomach , liver , pancreas , and spleen ; and they are , accordingly , subject to the twelve signs of the zodiac according to the sefer yetzirah , the first emanation from the spirit of god was the ruach rúaħ '' spirit , '' '' air '' ) that produced water , which , in its turn , formed the genesis of fire the book describes how god used the 10 sefirot and the 22 hebrew letters in various combinations , and finally ( as described in the closing section of the book ) , how he revealed this secret to abraham as a covenant with him from these premises the sefer yezirah draws the important conclusion that '' good and evil '' have no real existence , for since everything in nature can exist only by means of its contrast , a thing may be called good or evil according to its influence over man by the natural course of the contrast thus in the three prototypes of creation the contrasting elements fire and water are equalized by air ; corresponding to this are the three '' rulers '' among the letters , the mute mem contrasting with the hushing shin , and both being equalized by aleph the cosmos consists of three parts , the world , the year ( or time ) , and man , which are combined in such a way that the three primordial elements are contained in each of the three categories instead of the immediate creation ex nihilo , both works postulate a series of emanations of mediums between god and the universe ; and both consider god as the first cause only , and not as the immediate efficient cause of the world the twelve '' simple '' letters created the twelve signs of the zodiac , whose relation to the earth is always simple or stable ; and to them belong the twelve months in time , and the twelve '' leaders '' in man hence the sefirot must not be conceived as emanations in the ordinary sense of the word , but rather as modifications of the will of god , which first changes to air , then becomes water , and finally fire , the last being no further removed from god than the first besides these abstract ten sefirot , which are conceived only ideally , the twenty-two letters of the alphabet produced the material world , for they are real , and are the formative powers of all existence and development as the sefer yetzirah divides the hebrew alphabet into three groups , so the gnostic marcus divided the greek letters into three classes , regarded by him as the symbolic emanations of the three powers which include the whole number of the upper elements in contrast to the jewish grammarians , who assumed a special mode of articulation for each of the five groups of sounds , the sefer yetzirah says that no sound can be produced without the tongue , to which the other organs of speech merely lend assistance
