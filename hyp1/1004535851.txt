in an excited state , one or more of the protons or neutrons in a nucleus occupy a nuclear orbital of higher energy than an available nuclear orbital for example , a well-known nuclear isomer used in various medical procedures is , which decays with a half-life of about 6 hours by emitting a gamma ray of 140 & nbsp ; kev of energy ; this is close to the energy of medical diagnostic x-rays nuclear isomers have long half-lives because their gamma decay is '' forbidden '' from the large change in nuclear spin needed to emit a gamma ray the excited state in this situation is a good candidate to be metastable if there are no other states of intermediate spin with excitation energies less than that of the metastable state for isotopes with more than one metastable isomer , '' indices '' are placed after the designation , and the labeling becomes m1 , m2 , m3 , and so on this geometry can result in quantum-mechanical states where the distribution of protons and neutrons is so much further from spherical geometry that de-excitation to the nuclear ground state is strongly hindered in general , these states either de-excite to the ground state far more slowly than a '' usual '' excited state , or they undergo spontaneous fission with half-life of the order of nanoseconds or microseconds—a very short time , but many orders of magnitude longer than the half-life of a more usual nuclear excited state as a result , the characterization '' nuclear isomer '' is usually applied only to configurations with half-lives of 10 −9 & nbsp ; seconds or longer the low excitation energy of the isomeric state causes both gamma de-excitation to the ground state ( which itself is radioactive by beta decay , with a half-life of only 8 hours ) and direct beta decay to hafnium or tungsten to be suppressed due to spin mismatches this way of de-excitation had never been observed ; however , the de-excitation of by resonant photo-excitation of intermediate high levels of this nucleus ( e & nbsp ; ~ & nbsp ; 1 & nbsp ; mev ) was found in 1999 by belic and co-workers in the stuttgart nuclear physics group this direct detection allowed for a first measurement of the isomer 's lifetime under internal-conversion decay , the determination of the isomer 's magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moment via spectroscopy of the electronic shell and an improved measurement of the excitation energy the most common mechanism for suppression of gamma decay of excited nuclei , and thus the existence of a metastable isomer , is lack of a decay route for the excited state that will change nuclear angular momentum along any given direction by the most common amount of 1 quantum unit ħ in the spin angular momentum instead of a natural gamma-decay half-life of 10 −12 seconds , it has a half-life of more than 10 23 seconds , or at least 3 & nbsp ; × & nbsp ; 10 15 years , and thus has yet to be observed to decay an isotope such as 177 lu releases gamma rays by decay through a series of internal energy levels within the nucleus , and it is thought that by learning the triggering cross sections with sufficient accuracy , it may be possible to create energy stores that are 10 6 times more concentrated than high explosive or other traditional chemical energy storage the actual process has two types ( modes ) : gamma ray emission ( emission of a high-energy photon ) , internal conversion ( the energy is used to eject one of the atom 's electrons ) for example , 177m lu can beta-decay to 177 hf with a half-life of 160.4 & nbsp ; d , or it can undergo isomeric transition to 177 lu with a half-life of 160.4 & nbsp ; d , which then beta-decays to 177 hf with a half-life of 6.68 & nbsp ; d the emission of a gamma ray from an excited nuclear state allows the nucleus to lose energy and reach a lower-energy state , sometimes its ground state some nuclei are able to stay in this metastable excited state for minutes , hours , days , or occasionally far longer the process of isomeric transition is similar to gamma emission from any excited nuclear state , but differs by involving excited metastable states of nuclei with longer half-lives as with other excited states , the nucleus can be left in an isomeric state following the emission of an alpha particle , beta particle , or some other type of particle
