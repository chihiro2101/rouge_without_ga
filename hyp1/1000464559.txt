most of what was then known about electricity and magnetism , however , could be explained on the basis that charge is a continuous variable ; in much the same way that many of the properties of light can be explained by treating it as a continuous wave rather than as a stream of photons while franklin left his support for millikan 's measurement with the conclusion that concedes that millikan may have performed '' cosmetic surgery '' on the data , david goodstein investigated the original detailed notebooks kept by millikan , concluding that millikan plainly states here and in the reports that he included only drops that had undergone a '' complete series of observations '' and excluded no drops from this group of complete measurements the droplets entered the space between the plates and , because they were charged , could be made to rise and fall by changing the voltage across the plates reasons for a failure to generate a complete observation include annotations regarding the apparatus setup , oil drop production , and atmospheric effects which invalidated , in millikan 's opinion ( borne out by the reduced error in this set ) , a given particular measurement millikan in 1891 226x226px starting in 1908 , while a professor at the university of chicago , millikan , with the significant input of fletcher , and after improving his setup , published his seminal study in 1913 ( this is because the upwards electric force f e is greater for them than the downwards gravitational force f g , in the same way bits of paper can be picked by a charged rubber rod ) with the electrical field calculated , they could measure the droplet 's charge , the charge on a single electron being millikan and fletcher 's experiment involved measuring the force on oil droplets in a glass chamber sandwiched between two electrodes , one above and one below this enabled millikan to claim that he had calculated e to better than one half of one percent ; in fact , if millikan had included all of the data he had thrown out , the standard error of the mean would have been within 2 % a likely looking drop is selected and kept in the middle of the field of view by alternately switching off the voltage until all the other drops have fallen
