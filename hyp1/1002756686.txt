in 2002 , star trek : deep space nine producer ira steven behr stated that unlike some plots , which originated from a single small idea , the creation of the dominion villain and story arc was '' very much thought out '' behr said that the earliest mention of the dominion was purposely planted in the comic season two ferengi episode , '' rules of acquisition '' , to leave the audience with an impression of '' how important could it be ? '' it was decided that the gamma quadrant would need an ambience that would distinguish it from the alpha quadrant the producers wanted to portray the region as something other than '' uncharted space '' , and avoid imitating the adventures of star trek : the next generation with another series of plots focusing primarily on themes of exploration writer and script editor robert hewitt wolfe has explained that this move also distinguished deep space nine from its successor series , star trek : voyager , which stars a lost federation ship traversing the chaotic and divided delta quadrant of the milky way executive producer michael piller suggested the idea that the founders of the dominion be the race to which odo belongs , toward the end of season two production , and discovered that behr and wolfe had also discussed this possibility wolfe also characterized the dominion as a '' carrot and stick '' empire , with the vorta offering the carrot and the jem'hadar holding the stick the dominion incorporated a vast number of planets , and their resident species , into its military and civilian ranks , including : changelings/founders ( the rulers of the dominion ) vorta ( administrative/diplomatic/scientist class of clones ; genetic engineering by the founders ) jem'hadar ( shock troops under the direct command of the vorta ; genetically engineered by the founders ) son ' a hunters skreea karemma dosi breen cardassians t-rogorans little is revealed regarding the dominion 's inner workings , other than the fact that the jem'hadar and vorta fulfill the main military and administrative roles respectively the dominion was established between two thousand and ten thousand years before the events of star trek : deep space nine , by the changelings , a race of liquid lifeforms capable of shapeshifting , as a means of defending themselves against the widespread persecution they faced from humanoid races ( whom they called '' solids '' ) over 200 years before first contact with deep space nine , the changelings ' great link ( a planet in the gamma quadrant where changelings exist in their natural '' gelatinous '' form ) had sent out 100 changeling infants in containers throughout the universe in order to see how other ( alien ) races react to the presence of changelings although his deepest desire is to rejoin the great link , he is reluctant to do so due to the female changeling/founder 's mad crusade of total war against every solid in the alpha quadrant ; ironically , in the last episode odo does rejoin the great link , saving them from being totally destroyed in 2370 , jem'hadar troops annihilated numerous bajoran and federation colonies and ships in the gamma quadrant and captured commander benjamin sisko , as the dominion demanded the federation stay on their side of the '' anomaly '' a federation starship , the uss odyssey , was destroyed by a kamikaze attack after the federation rescued sisko , as the dominion demonstrated not only an ability to penetrate shielding , but a fanatical devotion to their cause as the suicide attack was made on a retreating ship , solely to drive the point home to the federation as a result of this incident , the federation pulled the uss defiant out of storage ( which was originally designed to combat the borg ) , complete with a romulan cloaking device , and began preparations for a drastic increase in deep space nine 's defensive capabilities in 2371 , the combined intelligence organizations of the cardassian and romulan attempted a strike into the gamma quadrant with a cloaked fleet , seeking to destroy the founders ' homeworld and cripple the dominion the changeling later sabotages the defiant and reprograms it to target the tzenkethi in the hopes that the attack on the tzenkethi will cause an outbreak of war , allowing the dominion to conquer the alpha quadrant after hours of fighting , dominion ships were outflanked by the arrival of a large klingon fleet , which won the running battle and allowed the defiant to break through to deep space nine later in the war , the mysterious race known as the breen joined forces with the dominion , and launched a devastating attack against starfleet headquarters on earth ( ds9 , '' the changing face of evil '' ) ( ds9 , '' what you leave behind '' ) the founders themselves were nearly wiped out by a plague , which was revealed to be a biological weapon engineered by agents of the secret clandestine federation agency section 31 , who deliberately infected odo with it , in the expectation that he would pass it through the great link odo 's return to the great link is partially intended to share with the other changelings the information he has about how the war concluded and what he knows from living with solids ; presumably , this is to change the goals and tactics of the founders to a system that coexists with the solids as opposed to a strategy of domination through odo 's efforts , the dominion permits visitors from the alpha quadrant to resume peaceful operations in the gamma quadrant in exchange for leaving its territory alone the dominion also make an appearance in star trek : conquest as one of the major races and have three ship types : a jem'hadar scout , a jem'hadar cruiser and a jem'hadar battleship it continues the story of the dominion fleet lost in the wormhole , the changeling laas and the fate of the founder leader after the dominion war the 2018 expansion victory is life introduces jem'hadar as a playable race , and shows the dominion ( represented by the changeling character odo ) fighting a losing war with the hur ' q , an alien species with connections to klingon history
