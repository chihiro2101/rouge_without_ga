( 4 ) peace would call for israeli withdrawal from occupied territories to secure borders ; ( 5 ) a palestinian entity ( but not an independent nation ) should be created the camp david accords were the result of 14 months of diplomatic efforts by egypt , israel , and the united states that began after jimmy carter became president sela , '' arab–israel conflict '' , 100 according to kenneth stein in heroic diplomacy : sadat , kissinger , carter , begin , and the quest for arab–israeli peace : the accords were another interim agreement or step , but negotiations that flowed from the accords slowed for several reasons while begin , who took office in may 1977 , officially favored the reconvening of the conference , perhaps even more vocally than rabin , and even accepted the palestinian presence , in actuality the israelis and the egyptians were secretly formulating a framework for bilateral talks ) egypt and israel agree that , in order to ensure a peaceful and orderly transfer of authority , and taking into account the security concerns of all the parties , there should be transitional arrangements for the west bank and gaza for a period not exceeding five years in response , carter had the choice of trying to salvage the agreement by conceding the issue of the west bank to begin , while advocating sadat 's less controversial position on the removal of all settlements from the sinai peninsula by the end of his first year in office , he had already met with anwar el sadat of egypt , king hussein of jordan , hafez al-assad of syria , and yitzhak rabin of israel alternate link to poll results from a bbc news article the menachem begin heritage foundation jaffe center poll on israeli public attitudes to the peace process ny times : anti-semitic 'elders of zion ' gets new life on egypt tv '' camp david 25th anniversary forum '' ( led by president carter ) despite the fact that he supported sadat 's peace initiative , king hussein refused to take part in the peace talks ;

the white house and state department were particularly concerned that sadat was merely reaching out to reacquire sinai as quickly as possible , putting aside the palestinian problem a/res/33/28 ) on 6 december 1979 , the un condemned in resolution 34/70 all partial agreements and separate treaties that did not meet the palestinian rights and comprehensive solutions to peace ; it condemned israel 's continued occupation and demanded withdrawal from all occupied territories accompanied by their capable negotiating teams and with their respective interests in mind , both leaders converged on camp david for 13 days of tense and dramatic negotiations from 5 to 17 september 1978 however , carter felt they were not '' aiming high enough '' and was interested in the establishment of a written '' land for peace '' agreement with israel returning the sinai peninsula and west bank begin and sadat had such mutual antipathy toward one another that they only seldom had direct contact ; thus carter had to conduct his own microcosmic form of shuttle diplomacy by holding one-on-one meetings with either sadat or begin in one cabin , then returning to the cabin of the third party to relay the substance of his discussions it was less clear than the agreements concerning the sinai , and was later interpreted differently by israel , egypt , and the united states egypt , israel , jordan and the representatives of the palestinian people should participate in negotiations on the resolution of the palestinian problem in all its aspects although most israelis supported the accords , the israeli settler opposed them because sadat 's refusal to agree to a treaty in which israel had any presence in the sinai peninsula at all meant they had to withdraw from the entire sinai peninsula as the truck approached the president , the leader of the belligerents – lieutenant khalid islambouli – came out of the truck and threw three grenades towards the president ;
