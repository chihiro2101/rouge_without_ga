many caves in central europe have skeletons of cave bears inside , for example the heinrichshöhle in hemer , the dechenhöhle in iserlohn , germany both the cave bear and the brown bear are thought to be descended from the plio-pleistocene etruscan bear ( ursus etruscus ) that lived about 5.3 & nbsp ; mya to 100,000 & nbsp ; years ago the immediate precursor of the cave bear was probably ursus deningeri ( deninger 's bear ) , a species restricted to pleistocene europe about 1.8 & nbsp ; mya to 100,000 & nbsp ; years ago in 2005 , scientists recovered and sequenced the nuclear dna of a cave bear that lived between 42,000 and 44,000 years ago both show that the cave bear was more closely related to the brown bear and polar bear than it was to the american black bear , but had split from the brown bear lineage before the distinct eastern and western brown bear lineages diversified and before the split of brown bears and polar bears the humerus of the cave bear was similar in size to that of the polar bear , as were the femora of females the morphological features of the cave bear chewing apparatus , including loss of premolars , have long been suggested to indicate their diets displayed a higher degree of herbivory than the eurasian brown bear for example , toothmarks on cave bear remains in areas where cave bears are the only recorded potential carnivores suggests occasional cannibalistic scavenging , possibly on individuals that died during hibernation , and dental microwear analysis indicates the cave bear may have fed on a greater quantity of bone than its contemporary , the smaller eurasian brown bear additionally , cave bear remains from peștera cu oase in the southwestern tip of the romanian part of the carpathian mountains had elevated levels of nitrogen-15 in their bones , indicative of omnivore diets , although the values are within the range of those found for the strictly herbivorous mammoth although the current prevailing opinion concludes that cave bears were largely herbivorous , and more so than any modern species of the genus ursus , increasing evidence points to omnivorous diets , based both on regional variability of isotopic composition of bone remains indicative of dietary plasticity , and on a recent re-evaluation of craniodental morphology that places the cave bear squarely among omnivorous modern bear species with respect to its skull and tooth shapes the presence of fully articulated adult cave lion skeletons , deep in cave bear dens , indicates the lions may have occasionally entered dens to prey on hibernating cave bears , with some dying in the attempt no traces of cave bears have been found in scotland , scandinavia or the baltic countries , which were all covered in extensive glaciers at the time others , however , point out that , though some caves have thousands of bones , they were accumulated over a period of 100,000 years or more , thus requiring only two deaths in a cave per year to account for the large numbers scholars speculated that it was proof of prehistoric human religious rites involving the cave bear , or that the drachenloch cave bears were hunted as part of a hunting ritual , or that the skulls were kept as trophies however , there have been archeological finds of cave bear teeth used in a necklace that dates back only 12,000 years ago , suggesting that the extinction may have happened much later compared with other megafaunal species that also became extinct during the last glacial maximum , the cave bear was believed to have had a more specialized diet of high-quality plants and a relatively restricted geographical range overhunting by humans has been largely dismissed because human populations at the time were too small to pose a serious threat to the cave bear 's survival , though the two species may have competed for living space in caves some evidence indicates that the cave bear used only caves for hibernation and was not inclined to use other locations , such as thickets , for this purpose , in contrast to the more versatile brown bear therefore , as human populations slowly increased , the cave bear faced a shrinking pool of suitable caves , and slowly faded away to extinction , as both neanderthals and anatomically modern humans sought out caves as living quarters , depriving the cave bear of vital habitat according to the research study , published in the journal molecular biology and evolution , radiocarbon dating of the fossil remains shows that the cave bear ceased to be abundant in central europe around 35,000 years ago in 2019 the results of a large scale study of 81 bone specimens ( resulting in 59 new sequences ) , and 64 previously published complete mitochondrial genomes of cave bear mitochondrial dna remains found in switzerland , poland , france , spain , germany , italy and serbia , indicated that the cave bear population drastically declined starting around 40,000 years ago at the onset of the aurignacian , coinciding with the arrival of anatomically modern humans in a study of spanish cave bear mtdna , each cave used by cave bears was found to contain almost exclusively a unique lineage of closely related haplotypes , indicating a homing behaviour for birthing and hibernation
