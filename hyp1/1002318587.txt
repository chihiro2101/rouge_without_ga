dutch mathematician and historian of mathematics , bartel leendert van der waerden attended lectures given by brouwer in later years , and commented : '' even though his most important research contributions were in topology , brouwer never gave courses in topology , but always on—and only on—the foundations of his intuitionism in 1905 , at the age of 24 , brouwer expressed his philosophy of life in a short tract life , art and mysticism , which has been described by the mathematician martin davis as '' drenched in romantic pessimism '' ( davis ( 2002 ) , p but in this address weyl '' while defending brouwer against some of hilbert 's criticisms.attempts to bring out the significance of hilbert 's approach to the problems of the foundations of mathematics it seemed that he was no longer convinced of his results in topology because they were not correct from the point of view of intuitionism , and he judged everything he had done before , his greatest output , false according to his philosophy brouwer founded intuitionism , a philosophy of mathematics that challenged the then-prevailing formalism of david hilbert and his collaborators , who included paul bernays , wilhelm ackermann , and john von neumann ( cf brouwer also proved the simplicial approximation theorem in the foundations of algebraic topology , which justifies the reduction to combinatorial terms , after sufficient subdivision of simplicial complexes , of the treatment of general continuous mappings ) , klarheit in religionsdingen , leipzig : leipziger universitätsverlag 2003 , pp.145–160 ) brouwer then '' embarked on a self-righteous campaign to reconstruct mathematical practice from the ground up so as to satisfy his philosophical convictions '' ; indeed his thesis advisor refused to accept his chapter ii '' as it stands , he became relatively isolated ; the development of intuitionism at its source was taken up by his student arend heyting kolmogorov supports most of brouwer 's results but disputes a few ; he discusses the ramifications of intuitionism with respect to '' transfinite judgements '' , e.g brouwer , in a paper entitled 'the untrustworthiness of the principles of logic ' , challenged the belief that the rules of the classical logic , which have come down to us essentially from aristotle ( 384 -- 322 b.c the most important were his fixed point theorem , the topological invariance of degree , and the invariance of domain it is a simple corollary to the second , concerning the topological invariance of degree , which is the best known among algebraic topologists brouwer gives brief synopsis of his belief that the law of excluded middle can not be '' applied without reservation even in the mathematics of infinite systems '' and gives two examples of failures to illustrate his assertion ' he was killed in 1966 at the age of 85 , struck by a vehicle while crossing the street in front of his house among mathematicians generally , the best known is the first one , usually referred to now as the brouwer fixed point theorem brouwer luitzen egbertus jan brouwer entry in stanford encyclopedia of philosophy chapter five : '' hilbert to the rescue '' wherein davis discusses brouwer and his relationship with hilbert and weyl with brief biographical information of brouwer he felt more and more isolated , and spent his last years under the spell of 'totally unfounded financial worries and a paranoid fear of bankruptcy , persecution and illness a variety of constructive mathematics , intuitionism is a philosophy of the foundations of mathematics he was involved in a very public and eventually demeaning controversy in the later 1920s with hilbert over editorial policy at mathematische annalen , at that time a leading learned journal
