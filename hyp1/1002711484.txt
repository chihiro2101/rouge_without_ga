receiving a sixty ruble fee , he exchanged it for the works of molière , racine , and boileau and it was probably under their influence that he wrote his other plays , of which his philomela ( written in 1786 ) was not published until 1795 for about four years ( 1797–1801 ) krylov lived at the country estate of prince sergey galitzine , and when the prince was appointed military governor of livonia , he accompanied him as a secretary and tutor to his children , resigning his position in 1803 by 1806 he had arrived in moscow , where he showed the poet and fabulist ivan dmitriev his translation of two of jean de la fontaine 's fables , “ the oak and the reed ” and “ the choosy bride ” , and was encouraged by him to write more honours were now showered on him in recognition of his growing reputation : the russian academy of sciences admitted him as a member in 1811 , and bestowed on him its gold medal in 1823 ; in 1838 a great festival was held in his honour under imperial sanction , and the emperor nicholas , with whom he was on friendly terms , granted him a generous pension the two were friends and pushkin modified krylov 's description of 'an ass of most honest principles ' ( '' the ass and the peasant '' ) to provide the opening of his romantic novel in verse , eugene onegin by the time of krylov 's death , 77,000 copies of his fables had been sold in russia , and his unique brand of wisdom and humor has remained popular ever since though he began as a translator and imitator of existing fables , krylov soon showed himself an imaginative , prolific writer , who found abundant original material in his native land and in the burning issues of the day in the case of '' the grandee '' ( 1835 ) , it was only allowed to be published after it became known that krylov had amused the emperor by reading it to him , ralston , p.13 while others did not see the light until long after his death , such as '' the speckled sheep '' , published in 1867 , and '' the feast '' in 1869 ralston , p.248 beside the fables of la fontaine , and one or two others , the germ of some of krylov 's other fables can be found in aesop , but always with his own witty touch and reinterpretation in russia his language is considered of high quality : his words and phrases are direct , simple and idiomatic , with color and cadence varying with the theme , many of them becoming actual idioms krylov 's '' the peasant and the snake '' makes la fontaine 's the farmer and the viper ( vi.13 ) the reference point as it relates how the reptile seeks a place in the peasant 's family , presenting itself as completely different in behaviour from the normal run of snakes to krylov 's approbation , with the ending of la fontaine 's fable in mind , the peasant kills it as untrustworthy though both fables concern being made the dupe of another , krylov tells of how one boy , rather than picking chestnuts from the fire , supports another on his shoulders as he picks the nuts and receives only the rinds in return again , in his '' the hops and the oak '' , harrison p.111 krylov merely embroiders on one of the variants of the elm and the vine in which an offer of support by the tree is initially turned down in his bibliographical and historical notes to the fables of krilof ( 1868 ) , the russian commentator v.f.kenevich sees the fable as referring to aesop 's “ the travellers and the plane tree ” on the other hand , the french critic jean fleury points out that gotthold ephraim lessing ’ s fable of '' the oak tree and the swine '' , fables and epigrams of lessing translated from the german , london 1825 , fable 33 a satirical reworking of aesop 's '' the walnut tree '' , is the more likely inspiration , coalescing as it does an uncaring pig and the theme of a useful tree that is maltreated napoleon.org the fable of '' the swan , the pike and the crawfish '' , all of them pulling a cart in a different direction , originally commented sceptically on a new phase in the campaign against napoleon in the coalition of 1814 ( although some interpreters tend to see it as an allusion to the endless debates of the state council kriloff 's original fables ) he was followed by alexander gretchaninov , who set 4 fables after ivan krylov for medium voice and piano ( op.33 ) , which included '' the musicians '' , '' the peasant and the sheep '' , '' the eagle and the bee '' , and '' the bear among the bees '' la fontaine knew latin and so was able to consult classical versions of aesop 's fables in that language – or , as in the case of “ the banker and the cobbler ” , to transpose an anecdote in a poem by horace into his own time though he lacked latin , he taught himself koine greek from a new testament in about 1819 , ralston , p.xxxii and so was able to read aesop in the original rather than remaining reliant on la fontaine 's recreations of latin versions the major difference between them , however , was that la fontaine created very few fables of his own , whereas the bulk of krylov 's work after 1809 was either indebted to other sources only for the germ of the idea or the fables were of his invention krylov 's first three fables , published in a moscow magazine in 1806 , followed la fontaine 's wording closely ; the majority of those in his 1809 collection were likewise adaptations of la fontaine much the same can be said of his treatment of '' the fly and the bee '' ( la fontaine 's the fly and the ant , iv.3 ) and '' the wolf and the shepherds '' ( la fontaine 's x.6 ) , which dispense with the circumstantiality of the original and retain little more than the reasoning : translations , memoirs of the author and notes on the fables in english translation can be found in w.r.s.ralston , krilof and his fables , prose translations and a memoir , originally published london 1869 ;
