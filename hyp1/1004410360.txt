in december 1998 , the ietf published - definition of the differentiated services field ( ds field ) in the ipv4 and ipv6 headers , which replaced the ipv4 tos field with the ds field in the ds field , a range of eight values ( class selectors ) is used for backward compatibility with the ip precedence specification in the former tos field today , diffserv has largely supplanted tos and other layer 3 qos mechanisms , such as integrated services ( intserv ) , as the primary architecture routers use to provide qos rather than differentiating network traffic based on the requirements of an individual flow , diffserv operates on the principle of traffic classification , placing each data packet into one of a limited number of traffic classes the premise of diffserv is that complicated functions such as packet classification and policing can be carried out at the edge of the network by edge routers a traffic classifier may inspect many different parameters in incoming packets , such as source address , destination address or traffic type and assign individual packets to a specific traffic class for tight control over volumes and type of traffic in a given class , a network operator may choose not to honor markings at the ingress to the diffserv domain explicit congestion notification ( ecn ) occupies the least-significant 2 bits of the ipv4 tos field and ipv6 traffic class ( tc ) field in practice , however , most networks use the following commonly defined per-hop behaviors : default forwarding ( df ) phb — which is typically best-effort traffic expedited forwarding ( ef ) phb — dedicated to low-loss , low-latency traffic assured forwarding ( af ) phb — gives assurance of delivery under prescribed conditions class selector phbs — which maintain backward compatibility with the ip precedence field because an overload of ef traffic will cause queuing delays and affect the jitter and delay tolerances within the class , admission control , traffic policing and other mechanisms may be applied to ef traffic diffserv or any other ip based qos marking does not ensure the quality of the service or a specified service-level agreement ( sla ) by marking the packets , the sender indicates that it wants the packets to be treated as a specific service , but there is no guarantee this happens it is up to all the service providers and their routers in the path to ensure that their policies will take care of the packets in an appropriate fashion — definition of the differentiated services field ( ds field ) in the ipv4 and ipv6 headers — a differentiated services code point ( dscp ) for capacity-admitted traffic ietf diffserv working group page cisco whitepaper — diffserv-the scalable end-to-end quality of service model acm sigcomm'09 paper- modeling and understanding end-to-end class of service policies in operational networks : proposes a practical model for extracting diffserv policies cisco : implementing quality of service policies with dscp
