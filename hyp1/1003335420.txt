graduate students must usually declare their research goal or submit a research proposal upon entering grad school ; in the case of master 's degrees , there will be some flexibility ( that is , one is not held to one 's research proposal , although major changes , for example from premodern to modern history , are discouraged ) there has also been some confusion over the conversion of the different marking schemes between british , us , and australian systems for the purpose of assessment for entry to graduate programmes admission to a master 's ( course-based , also called '' non-thesis '' ) program generally requires a bachelor 's degree in a related field , with sufficiently high grades usually ranging from b+ and higher ( note that different schools have different letter grade conventions , and this requirement may be significantly higher in some faculties ) , and recommendations from professors there are two types of postgraduate ; lato sensu ( latin for '' in broad sense '' ) , which generally means a specialization course in one area of study , mostly addressed to professional practice , and stricto sensu ( latin for '' in narrow sense '' ) , which means a master of science or doctorate , encompassing broader and profound activities of scientific research traditionally , doctoral programs were only intended to last three to four years and , in some disciplines ( primarily the natural sciences ) , with a helpful advisor , and a light teaching load , it is possible for the degree to be completed in that amount of time award of postgraduate degrees requires a defence of the completed research before a panel of examiners comprising external and internal examiners , head of department , departmental postgraduate coordinator , representative ( s ) of faculty and postgraduate school , and any other member of staff with a phd in the department/faculty '' for some social science and many humanities disciplines , where graduate students may or may not have studied the discipline at the undergraduate level , these exams will be the first set , and be based either on graduate coursework or specific preparatory reading ( sometimes up to a year 's work in reading ) physician , surgeon , pharmacist , dentist , veterinarian diplomas ) as equivalent to a master 's degree in any other discipline , to account for the difficulty gap between getting a medical degree and getting non health related doctoral degrees , the latter requiring original research a th.m is one year of seminary study followed by a shorter thesis ( usually around one hundred pages ) that does not necessarily have to be a unique contribution to the field ( unlike a dissertation ) in the case of ph.d.s , the research direction is usually known as it will typically follow the direction of the master 's research funding for postgraduate study in the uk is awarded competitively , and usually is disseminated by institution ( in the form of a certain allocation of studentships for a given year ) rather than directly to individuals theses may be presented in english or in the language of the subject ( german for german literature , for example ) , but if this is the case an extensive abstract must be also presented in english passing such examinations allows the student to stay , begin doctoral research , and rise to the status of a doctoral candidate while failing usually results in the student leaving the program or re-taking the test after some time has passed ( usually a semester or a year ) admission to a doctoral program generally requires a thesis-type master 's degree in a related field , sufficiently high grades , recommendations , samples of writing , a research proposal , and typically an interview with a prospective supervisor a person applying for a doctoral program in biblical studies or theology from a seminary or theological school must already hold a first professional degree in the field , known as the master of divinity degree ( m.div candidates for the degree of doctor of education ( ed.d ) are typically required to hold a good bachelor 's degree as well as an appropriate master 's degree before being admitted there are a number of scholarships for master 's courses , but these are relatively rare and dependent on the course and class of undergraduate degree obtained ( usually requiring at least a lower second ) generally , in order to be accepted , the candidate must have above average grades and it is highly recommended to be initiated on scientific research through government programs on undergraduate areas , as a complement to usual coursework admission to a postgraduate degree programme in nigeria requires a bachelor 's degree with at least a second class lower division ( not less than 2.75/5 ) admission to a high-quality thesis-type master 's program generally requires an honours degree or canadian honours degree , samples of the student 's writing as well as a research thesis proposal some students may also choose to remain in a program if they fail to win an academic position , particularly in disciplines with a tight job market ; by remaining a student , they can retain access to libraries and university facilities , while also retaining an academic affiliation , which can be essential for conferences and job-searches for example , a british student who achieves 70+ will receive an a grade , whereas an australian student with 70+ will receive a distinction which is not the highest grade in the marking scheme admission to a graduate certificate program requires a university degree ( or in some cases , a diploma with years of related experience ) these differences are due to the differing nature of research between the humanities and some social sciences and the natural sciences , and to the differing expectations of the discipline in coursework , languages and length of thesis the most widely available , and thus important , award for overseas students is the overseas research student ( ors ) award , which pays the difference in university fees between an overseas student and a british or eu resident other factors contributing to possible financial difficulties include high costs to visit their families back home , supporting one 's family who is not allowed to work due to immigration laws , tuition that is steep by world standards , and large fees : visa fees by us citizenship and immigration services , surveillance fees ( such as student and exchange visitor information systems , or sevis ) by the united states congress and the united states department of homeland security . additionally , doctoral students who have advanced to candidacy but not filed a dissertation ( '' abd , '' for '' all but dissertation '' ) often receive master 's degrees and an additional master 's called a master of philosophy , or m.phil master 's degrees can possibly be completed in one year but normally take at least two , or in the case of a required research-based thesis a maximum of three ; they typically do not exceed five years the master 's component of a doctorate program often requires one or two years , and some students , because doctoral programs are sometimes better-funded , apply for doctoral programs while only intending to earn a master 's degree in some departments , a comprehensive examination is often required in the first year of doctoral study , and is designed to test a student 's background undergraduate-level knowledge candidacy examination ( '' candidacy '' ) , or a general examination ( '' generals '' ) designed to test the students ' grasp of a broad sample of their discipline , or one or several special field examinations ( '' specials '' ) which test students in their narrower selected areas of specialty within the discipline at english-speaking universities , applicants from countries where english is not the primary language are required to submit scores from the test of english as a foreign language ( toefl ) some schools have an intermediate category , passing at the master 's level , which allows the student to leave with a master 's without having completed a master 's thesis such funding generally comes from research councils such as the engineering and physical sciences research council ( epsrc ) , arts and humanities research council ( ahrc ) , medical research council ( mrc ) and others admission to doctoral programmes requires an academic master 's degree with a minimum weighted average of 60 % ( b average or 4.00/5 ) the increase in length of degree is a matter of great concern for both students and universities , though there is much disagreement on potential solutions to this problem
