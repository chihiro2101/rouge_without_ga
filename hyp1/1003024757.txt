technology can be used theoretically or practically to render real-world objects invisible : making use of a real-time image displayed on a wearable display , it is possible to create a see-through effect comparing light waves to the water , and whatever object that is being '' cloaked '' to the stone , the goal is to have light waves pass around that object , leaving no visible aspects of it , possibly not even a shadow xiang zhang , of the university of california , berkeley said : '' in the case of invisibility cloaks or shields , the material would need to curve light waves completely around the object like a river flowing around a rock '' uc berkeley researcher jason valentine 's team made a material that affects light near the visible spectrum , in a region used in fibre optics : 'instead of the fish appearing to be slightly ahead of where it is in the water , it would actually appear to be above the water 's surface pendry , who theorized the invisibility cloak '' as a joke '' to illustrate the potential of metamaterials , said in an interview in august 2011 that grand , theatrical manifestations of his idea are probably overblown : '' i think it â€™ s pretty sure that any cloak that harry potter would recognize is not on the table '' in turkey in 2009 , bilkent university search center of nanotechnology researches explained and published in new journal of physics that they achieved to make invisibility real in practice using nanotechnology making an object invisible with no shadows etc the material , called quantum stealth , is currently still in the prototyping stage , but was developed by the company 's ceo guy cramer primarily for military purposes , to conceal agents and equipment such as tanks and jets in the field they discovered that the structure of a material can be modified to be usable for frequencies operating photonic devices and sensors , for example , while the structural modification becomes invisible for frequencies detectable by the eye more precisely , they found that the positive refractive index ( ri ) change induced by the electronic resonance variation can exactly compensate the negative ri change induced by a structural expansion ( both caused by the laser-induced modification ) , resulting in a zero ri change for certain colors , enabling invisibility the term was used in this manner in the title of the book invisible man , by ralph ellison , in reference to the protagonist , likely modeled after the author , being overlooked on account of his status as an african american in fiction , people or objects can be rendered completely invisible by several means : magical objects such as rings , cloaks and amulets can be worn to grant the wearer permanent invisibility ( or temporary invisibility until the object is taken off )
