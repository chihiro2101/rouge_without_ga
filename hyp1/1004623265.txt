two knots can be added by cutting both knots and joining the pairs of ends find a rectangle in the plane where one pair of opposite sides are arcs along each knot while the rest of the rectangle is disjoint from the knots having a preferred direction of travel along the knot , and requiring the arcs of the knots in the sum are oriented consistently with the oriented boundary of the rectangle a prime knot if it is non-trivial and can not be written as the knot sum of two non-trivial knots while you can not form the unknot in three dimensions by adding two non-trivial knots , you can in higher dimensions , at least when one considers smooth knots in codimension at least 3 the sequence of the number of prime knots of a given crossing number , up to crossing number 16 , is 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 7 , 21 , 49 , 165 , 552 , 2176 , 9988 , , , the first knot tables by tait , little , and kirkman used knot diagrams , although tait also used a precursor to the dowker notation the development of knot theory due to alexander , reidemeister , seifert , and others eased the task of verification and tables of knots up to and including 9 crossings were published by alexander–briggs and reidemeister in the late 1920s conway found a number of omissions but only one duplication in the tait–little tables ; however he missed the duplicates called the perko pair , which would only be noticed in 1974 by kenneth perko links are written by the crossing number with a superscript to denote the number of components and a subscript to denote its order within the links with the same number of components and crossings alexander–briggs names in the range 10 162 to 10 166 are ambiguous , due to the discovery of the perko pair in charles newton little 's original and subsequent knot tables , and differences in approach to correcting this error in knot tables and other publications created after this point the dowker–thistlethwaite notation , also called the dowker notation or code , for a knot is a finite sequence of even integers the conway notation for knots and links , named after john horton conway , is based on the theory of tangles such a polyhedron is denoted first by the number of vertices then a number of asterisks which determine the polyhedron 's position on a list of basic polyhedra the last example is usually written 8 3:2 0 , where the ones are omitted and kept the number of dots excepting the dots at the end for an algebraic knot such as in the first example , 1 is often omitted for example , the trefoil knot in gauss code can be given as : 1 , −2,3 , −1,2 , −3 gauss code is limited in its ability to identify knots knotinfo : table of knot invariants and knot theory resources the knot atlas — detailed info on individual knots in knot tables knotplot — software to investigate geometric properties of knots knotscape — software to create images of knots knoutilus — online database and image generator of knots knotdata.html — wolfram mathematica function for investigating knots
