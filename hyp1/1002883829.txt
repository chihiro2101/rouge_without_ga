meanwhile , suvorov and chasteler planned to throw three columns at the french , with the main strength on the right to break down macdonald 's flank by advancing from the tidone to the trebbia and finally all the way to the nure , the next river to the east the war of the second coalition in northern italian began with the inconclusive battle of verona on 26 march 1799 between the habsburg army of paul kray and the republican french army of italy under barthélemy louis joseph schérer a second authority placed the 12th line in olivier 's division rather than salme 's advanced guard , specified that the 17th in rusca 's division was light infantry , put the 2nd line instead of the 3rd line in montrichard 's division and listed different unit totals in some divisions suvorov determined from captured dispatches that macdonald 's mangled army was no longer a threat to northern italy and marched the allied army back west on the 23rd , hoping to catch moreau between himself and belegarde as dombrowski 's troops mounted a flank attack to the south , the troops of victor 's division fought their way to the village of sarmato where they were held up by an austrian artillery battery and two battalions of the nádasdy regiment on 27 april , the coalition allies led by suvorov were victorious over jean victor marie moreau 's french army at the battle of cassano along the adda river the subsequent battle of magnano on 5 april was a clear-cut victory by kray over the french , with the austrians sustaining 6,000 casualties while inflicting losses of 8,000 men and 18 guns on their foes in order to accomplish this , he asked moreau to march north and east to meet him near piacenza , an impractical move that would place the army of italy in the midst of its enemies finding his strong position behind the mincio river outflanked on the north by 12,000 austrians , schérer left 12,000 troops to hold the key fortress of mantua , directed 1,600 more to defend peschiera del garda and retreated to the west on 12 april the advanced guard was led by general of brigade jean-baptiste salme and included the 11th line ( 1,390 ) , 12th line ( 1,250 ) and 15th light ( 1,340 ) infantry demi-brigades , a detachment of the 25th chasseurs à cheval regiment ( 85 ) , the 6th company of the 8th foot artillery regiment ( 34 ) and the 3rd company of the 1st sapper battalion ( 29 ) in the meantime , melas noticed the presence of strong enemy forces at the north end of the battleline and sent 12 artillery pieces to the west bank of the trebbia to blast the french positions coming from the south , a polish battalion threatened the russian rear , but it was quickly hemmed in by russian infantry , the austrian karaczay dragoons and cossacks and 230 men were forced to lay down their arms the first column on the right was headed by an advance guard under major general pyotr bagration which included the dendrygin , kalemin , lomonosov and sanaev combined grenadier battalions , two battalions of the bagration jäger regiment , grekov and posdeev cossack regiments and six squadrons of the austrian karaczay dragoon regiment nr but with bagration 's forces pulled to the south by dombrowski 's ill-fated attack , rusca 's men found a gap in the allied line south of casaliggio if ott could hold out along the tidone river , it would allow ample space for the austro-russian army to deploy between the po and the mountain spurs to the south the french maintained a firm grip on the west bank of the trebbia , but macdonald 's division commanders were not able to give him any estimate of their remaining strength 89 on 12 june in the battle of modena , the french inflicted losses of 750 killed and wounded on their enemies while capturing 1,650 men , eight guns and three colors an alert french staff officer , pierre edmé gautherin brought the divisions of rusca and victor to the west bank of the trebbia where they stopped and drove back bagration 's troops the 3rd division was supervised by general of division montrichard and was made up of the 3rd ( or 2nd ) line ( 730 ) , 21st line ( 1,000 ) , 68th line ( 900 ) and 5th light ( 1,900 ) infantry demi-brigades , 1st cavalry ( 263 ) , 12th dragoon ( 400 ) , 11th hussar ( 250 ) , cisalpine dragoon ( 100 ) and cisalpine hussar ( 308 ) regiments and gunners and sappers ( 112 ) on 9 june suvorov received news from peter karl ott von bátorkéz that victor and montrichard reinforced macdonald and that the french captured pontremoli from there , the safest course was to use the west coast road to reach genoa , keeping the apennine mountains between him and the allies 87 as it moved north , the army of naples absorbed the divisions of victor , montrichard and gaultier , bringing its total field force to 36,728 soldiers the russians presently gained the upper hand and compelled rusca to pull back to the east bank of the trebbia , which his men accomplished while maintaining their ranks in a scene of horror , thousands of dead and wounded soldiers littered the bed of the trebbia while piacenza 's austrian garrison blindly fired cannons into the night accompanied in person by suvorov , the russians defeated their mostly polish opponents with serious losses and forced them to retreat to the east bank victor 's division led the french attack on ott as rusca 's soldiers edged toward the south as if to flank the austrians out of position farther north , victor 's division was repulsed by a combination of schveikovsky 's left wing and förster 's division and withdrew to the french-held east bank he believed that his 22,000 available soldiers were outnumbered and ought to retreat , but he anticipated that moreau might soon arrive to pitch into the allied rear scouts reported that the french were defending behind the trebbia with advanced positions near the villages of san nicolò , gragnano trebbiense and casaliggio , from north to south 158 during the pursuit , macdonald was set upon by a troop of french royalist cavalry and suffered saber cuts on the head and arm before his own soldiers could finish off their enemies around the same time that olivier made his attack , salme 's advanced guard and watrin 's division , which had previously been in reserve , crossed the trebbia on the far right flank but the allies were aware that jacques macdonald had a strong french occupation force in southern and central italy this source also named as brigade commanders , johann i joseph , prince of liechtenstein for the grenadiers , ferdinand johann von morzin for the nádasdy , mittrowsky and württemberg regiments and friedrich heinrich von gottesheim for the d'aspre , mihanovich , banater and archduke joseph units suvorov ordered bellegarde 's corps to march on alessandria to keep an eye on moreau while the rest of his army concentrated against macdonald because of the wounds he sustained at modena , macdonald was bedridden in the village of borgo san antonio to the west of piacenza meanwhile , an artillery battery detached from the mantua siege corps under the command of colonel kinsky unlimbered on the north bank of the po at 5:00 pm the span was in place and suvorov 's army crossed and marched all night to reach castelnuovo scrivia on the morning of the 16th macdonald was also aware of the presence of a force under jean françois cornu de la poype that was in position to threaten the allied south flank since the fortress of alessandria commanded the only crossing of the bormida , the austro-russian main body waited on a pontoon train which finally arrived on 15 june having disposed of montrichard 's division earlier , the allies were free to mass against olivier 's division and eventually throw it back to the trebbia 's east bank allowing for the possibility of defeat , the russian army commander ordered the po to be bridged at cava manara for the main army and valenza for bellegarde 's corps one battalion of warasdiner grenz and one squadron of the bussy mounted jägers tried to block macdonald 's retreat but were crushed on 24 june at sassuolo south of modena macdonald planned to destroy hohenzollern 's division by pinning it with his own column while enveloping it with dombrowski 's division from the west and rusca 's division from the east 99-100 suvorov 's desire to start the attack at 7:00 am proved to be impractical due to the allied soldiers ' exhaustion , so it was put off until 11:00 am accordingly , he assembled the army of naples and moved north , leaving southern italy in the hands of local forces to keep macdonald from raising the siege of mantua , kray manned the north bank of the po with several thousand troops next to the west were the divisions of jean-baptiste olivier and françois watrin , accompanied by macdonald and advancing from pistoia on modena in the south rusca and victor were directed to attack side-by-side near casaliggio , supported by an outflanking move by dombrowski via rivalta the austrian guns proceeded to bombard their enemies , encouraging them in their decision to recross the trebbia though the austrians made prisoners of 300 french meanwhile , macdonald determined to launch an assault , putting his faith in the french soldier 's enthusiasm for the attack and his troops ' good morale if ott were forced back into the narrow stradella position , it would be difficult for the allies to form a line of battle and might even cause a rout to face this array , moreau counted about 25,000 soldiers in the divisions of paul grenier , claude victor-perrin , pierre garnier de laboissière at genoa , paul louis gaultier de kervéguen at florence and joseph hélie désiré perruquet de montrichard at bologna on 14 april 1799 , the french directory ordered macdonald to help the french forces in northern italy the french divisions were deployed with victor on the right , rusca in the center and dombrowski on the left immediately , suvorov ordered ott to conduct a staged withdrawal to stradella , but to hold that position at all hazards two days later , alexander suvorov arrived at vicenza with an russian empire army and assumed command of the combined austro-russian forces the remaining infantry division was led by general of division victor and included the 5th line ( 1,300 ) , 39th line ( 1,225 ) , 92nd line ( 1,240 ) , 93rd line ( 1,265 ) and 99th line ( 1,320 ) infantry demi-brigades and 15th chasseurs à cheval regiment ( 400 ) but perhaps the real reason was that macdonald wished to make a theatrical entrance to the campaign by smashing his way through the coalition allies
