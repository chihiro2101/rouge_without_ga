the philippine peso ( filipino : piso ) is derived from the spanish silver coin real de a ocho or spanish dollar , in wide circulation in the entire america and southeast asia during the 17th and 18th centuries , through its use in the spanish colonies and even in the united states and canada it was minted in large quantities after the discovery of silver in mexico , peru and bolivia in the 16th century and immediately became a coin of worldwide importance in international trade between europe , asia and north america thus , following the great silver devaluation of 1873 , the philippine peso devalued in parallel with the mexican unit , and by the end of the 19th century , was worth half a united states dollar initially the peso was produced in spanish latin america in a rapid and simplified manner by cutting off a lump of silver of proper weight and fineness from the end of a silver bar , which was then flattened out and impressed by a hammer 24 but the spanish dollar continued to dominate the eastern trade , and the peso of eight reales continued to be minted in the new world this coin was known to english colonists in north america as a piece of eight , then later on as a spanish dollar , spanish milled dollar , and finally as a mexican dollar the coin was sometimes called a republican dollar , but eventually any peso of the old spanish eight-real standard was generally referred to as a mexican dollar , mexico being the most prolific producer while the relationship of 8 reales 1 ( or peso duro ) continued in the americas until the 19th century , spain grappled with the issuance of reales de vellon ( made of billon alloy with less than Â½ silver ) of various weights and finenesses starting 1600 due to its domestic financial and monetary problems prior to 1873 , the mexican dollar would have been to all intents and purposes equal in value to the silver dollar coins of the united states north of the border , but at that time in history , the mexican coin would have had a much greater international notoriety than that of the u.s
