the basic idea of relevant implication appears in medieval logic , and some pioneering work was done by ackermann , moh , moh shaw-kwei , 1950 , '' , '' methodos 2 56–75 drawing on them , nuel belnap and alan ross anderson ( with others ) wrote the magnum opus of the subject , entailment : the logic of relevance and necessity in the 1970s ( the second volume being published in the nineties ) they focused on both systems of entailment and systems of relevance , where implications of the former kinds are supposed to be both relevant and necessary a\to a a\land b\to a a\land b\to b ( a\to b ) \land ( a\to c ) \to ( a\to b\land c ) a\to a\lor b b\to a\lor b ( a\to c ) \land ( b\to c ) \to ( a\lor b\to c ) a\land ( b\lor c ) \to ( a\land b ) \lor ( a\land c ) \lnot\lnot a\to a the rules are the following a , a\to b\vdash b a , b\vdash a\land b a\to b\vdash ( c\to a ) \to ( c\to b ) a\to b\vdash ( b\to c ) \to ( a\to c ) a\to b\vdash \lnot b\to\lnot a stronger logics can be obtained by adding any of the following axioms ( a\to b ) \to ( \lnot b\to\lnot a ) ( a\to b ) \land ( b\to c ) \to ( a\to c ) ( a\to b ) \to ( ( b\to c ) \to ( a\to c ) ) ( a\to b ) \to ( ( c\to a ) \to ( c\to b ) ) ( a\to ( a\to b ) ) \to ( a\to b ) ( a\land ( a\to b ) ) \to b ( a\to\lnot a ) \to\lnot a ( a\to ( b\to c ) ) \to ( b\to ( a\to c ) ) a\to ( ( a\to b ) \to b ) ( ( a\to a ) \to b ) \to b a\lor\lnot a a\to ( a\to a ) there are some notable logics stronger than b that can be obtained by adding axioms to b as follows for e , add axioms 1-7 , 10 , 11 , ( ( a\to a ) \land ( b\to b ) \to c ) \to c , and \box a\land \box b\to \box ( a\land b ) , where \box a is defined as ( a\to a ) \to a a routley–meyer frame f for a propositional language is a quadruple ( w , r , ,0 ) , where w is a non-empty set , r is a ternary relation on w , and is a function from w to w , and 0\in w a routley-meyer model m is a routley-meyer frame f together with a valuation , \vdash , that assigns a truth value to each atomic proposition relative to each point a\in w the algebraic structures for r are de morgan algebra , which are sextuples ( d , \land , \lor , \lnot , \circ , e ) where ( d , \land , \lor , \lnot ) is a distributive lattice with a unary operation , \lnot obeying the laws \lnot\lnot x x and if x\leq y then \lnot y\leq \lnot x ; e\in d , the binary operation \circ is commutative ( x\circ y y\circ x ) and associative ( ( x\circ y ) \circ z x\circ ( y\circ z ) ) , and e\circ x x , i.e ( d , \circ , e ) is an abelian monoid with identity e ; the monoid is lattice-ordered and satisfies x\circ ( y\lor z ) ( x\circ y ) \lor ( x\circ z ) ; x\leq x\circ x ; and if x\circ y\leq z , then x\circ\lnot z\leq \lnot y : x \circ y\leq z \iff x\leq y\to z an interpretation v is a homomorphism from the propositional language to a de morgan monoid m such that v ( p ) \in d for all atomic propositions , v ( \lnot a ) \lnot v ( a ) v ( a\lor b ) v ( a ) \lor v ( b ) v ( a\land b ) v ( a ) \land v ( b ) v ( a\to b ) v ( a ) \to v ( b ) given a de morgan monoid m and an interpretation v , one can say that formula a holds on v just in case e\leq v ( a )
