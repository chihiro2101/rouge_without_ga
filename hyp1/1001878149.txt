by deforestation ) and thereby is submitted to intense evaporation , the upward capillary movement of water , which has dissolved iron and aluminum salts , is responsible for the formation of a superficial hard pan of laterite or bauxite , respectively , which is improper for cutivation , a known case of irreversible soil degradation ( lateritization , bauxitization ) other important functions are fulfilled by earthworms in the soil ecosystem , in particular their intense mucus production , both within the intestine and as a lining in their galleries , exert a organic matter on soil microflora , giving them the status of ecosystem engineers , which they share with ants and termites this process is also called arenization , resulting in the formation of sandy soils ( granitic arenas ) , thanks to the much higher resistance of quartz compared to other mineral components of granite ( micas , amphiboles , feldspars ) jenny 's state equation in factors of soil formation differs from the vasily dokuchaev equation , treating time ( t ) as a factor , adding topographic relief ( r ) , and pointedly leaving the ellipsis '' open '' for more factors ( state variables ) to be added as our understanding becomes more refined while a mixture of sand , silt and clay constitute the texture of a soil and the aggregation of those components produces peds , the development of a distinct b horizon marks the development of a soil or pedogenesis climate is the dominant factor in soil formation , and soils show the distinctive characteristics of the climate zones in which they form , with a feedback to climate through transfer of carbon stocked in soil horizons back to the atmosphere oxidation of a mineral compound is the inclusion of oxygen in a mineral , causing it to increase its oxidation number and swell due to the relatively large size of oxygen , leaving it stressed and more easily attacked by water ( hydrolysis ) or carbonic acid ( carbonation ) the type and amount of precipitation influence soil formation by affecting the movement of ions and particles through the soil , and aid in the development of different soil profiles a specific example of the evolution of soils in prehistoric lake beds is in the makgadikgadi pans of the kalahari desert , where change in an ancient river course led to millennia of salinity buildup and formation of calcretes and silcretes in general , the mixing of the soil by the activities of animals , sometimes called pedoturbation , tends to undo or counteract the tendency of other soil-forming processes that create distinct horizons aeolian processes ( movement by wind ) are capable of moving silt and fine sand many hundreds of miles , forming loess soils ( 60â€“90 percent silt ) , common in the midwest of north america , north-western europe , argentina and central asia plants shade soils , keeping them cooler and slow evaporation of soil moisture , or conversely , by way of transpiration , plants can cause soils to lose moisture , resulting in complex and highly variable relationships between leaf area index ( measuring light interception ) and moisture loss : more generally plants prevent soil from desiccation during driest months while they dry it during moister months , thereby acting as a buffer against strong moisture variation these patterns emerge from topographic differences in erosion , deposition , fertility , soil moisture , plant cover , other soil biology , fire-history , and exposure to the elements the direct influences of climate include : a shallow accumulation of lime in low rainfall areas as caliche formation of acid soils in humid areas erosion of soils on steep hillsides deposition of eroded materials downstream very intense chemical weathering , leaching , and erosion in warm and humid regions where soil does not freeze climate directly affects the rate of weathering and leaching the growth of roots through the soil stimulates microbial populations , stimulating in turn the activity of their predators ( notably amoeba ) , thereby increasing the mineralization rate , and in last turn root growth , a positive feedback called the soil microbial loop rock , whether its origin is igneous , sedimentary , or metamorphic , is the source of all soil mineral materials and the origin of all plant nutrients with the exceptions of nitrogen , hydrogen and carbon the mineralogical and chemical composition of the primary bedrock material , its physical features , including grain size and degree of consolidation , and the rate and type of weathering transforms the parent material into a different mineral marine deposits , such as soils along the atlantic and gulf coasts and in the imperial valley of california of the united states , are the beds of ancient seas that have been revealed as the land uplifted cycles of wetting and drying cause soil particles to be abraded to a finer size , as does the physical rubbing of material as it is moved by wind , water , and gravity he demonstrated this in 1898 using the soil forming equation : : s soil formation cl ( sometimes c ) climate o organisms ( soil microbiology , soil mesofauna , soil biology ) r relief p parent material t time this is often remembered with the mnemonic clorpt plants have fine roots that excrete organic compounds ( sugars , organic acids , mucigel ) , slough off cells ( in particular at their tip ) and are easily decomposed , adding organic matter to soil , a process called rhizodeposition soil animals , including soil macrofauna and soil mesofauna , mix soils as they form burrows and pores , allowing moisture and gases to move about , a process called bioturbation often called weathered granite , saprolite is the result of weathering processes that include : hydrolysis , chelation from organic compounds , hydration ( the solution of minerals in water with resulting cation and anion pairs ) and physical processes that include freezing and thawing temperature and moisture both influence the organic matter content of soil through their effects on the balance between primary production and decomposition : the colder or drier the climate the lesser atmospheric carbon is fixed as organic matter while the lesser organic matter is decomposed their tillage also mixes the different soil layers , restarting the soil formation process as less weathered material is mixed with the more developed upper layers , resulting in net increased rate of mineral weathering russian geologist vasily dokuchaev , commonly regarded as the father of pedology , determined in 1883 that soil formation occurs over time under the influence of climate , vegetation , topography , and parent material the topography , or relief , is characterized by the inclination ( slope ) , elevation , and orientation of the terrain it takes decades to several thousand years for a soil to develop a profile , although the notion of soil development has been criticized , soil being in a constant state-of-change under the influence of fluctuating soil-forming factors soil factors such as density , depth , chemistry , ph , temperature and moisture greatly affect the type of plants that can grow in a given location redox , the opposite of oxidation , means the removal of oxygen , hence the oxidation number of some part of the mineral is reduced , which occurs when oxygen is scarce surplus water percolating through the soil profile transports soluble and suspended materials from the upper layers ( eluviation ) to the lower layers ( illuviation ) , including clay particles and dissolved organic matter the greater the depth of water penetration , the greater the depth of weathering of the soil and its development this led to the development of empirical models to describe pedogenesis , such as climofunctions , biofunctions , topofunctions , lithofunctions , and chronofunctions since hans jenny published his formulation in 1941 , it has been used by innumerable soil surveyors all over the world as a qualitative list for understanding the factors that may be important for producing the soil pattern within a region climate also indirectly influences soil formation through the effects of vegetation cover and biological activity , which modify the rates of chemical reactions in the soil soil is the most abundant ecosystem on earth , but the vast majority of organisms in soil are microbes , a great many of which have not been described earthworms , ants , termites , moles , gophers , as well as some millipedes and tenebrionid beetles mix the soil as they burrow , significantly affecting soil formation the solution of salts in water results from the action of bipolar water molecules on ionic salt compounds producing a solution of ions and water , removing those minerals and reducing the rock 's integrity , at a rate depending on water flow and pore channels they aerate and stir the soil and create stable soil aggregates , after having disrupted links between soil particles during the intestinal transit of ingested soil , thereby assuring ready infiltration of water soil formation is influenced by at least five classic factors that are intertwined in the evolution of a soil the effects of ancient ecosystems are not as easily observed , and this challenges the understanding of soil formation water may then enter the cracks and freeze and cause the physical splitting of material along a path toward the center of the rock , while temperature gradients within the rock can cause exfoliation of '' shells '' , precipitation minus evapotranspiration ) and temperature , both of which affect the rates of chemical , physical , and biological processes
