in this period , he began his lectures on hermeneutics ( 1805–1833 ) and he also wrote his dialogue the weihnachtsfeier ( christmas eve : dialogue on the incarnation , 1806 ) , which represents a midway point between his speeches and his great dogmatic work , der christliche glaube ( the christian faith ) ; the speeches represent phases of his growing appreciation of christianity as well as the conflicting elements of the theology of the period '' the one general function of the ego , thought , becomes in relation to the non-ego either receptive or spontaneous action , and in both forms of action its organic , or sense , and its intellectual energies co-operate ; and in relation to man , nature and the universe the ego gradually finds its true individuality by becoming a part of them , '' every extension of consciousness being higher life the essential nature of the concept is that it combines the general and the special , and the same combination recurs in being ; in being the system of substantial or permanent forms answers to the system of concepts and the relation of cause and effect to the system of judgments , the higher concept answering to '' force '' and the lower to the phenomena of force , and the judgment to the contingent interaction of things schleiermacher classifies the virtues under the two forms of gesinnung ( '' disposition , attitude '' ) and fertigkeit ( '' dexterity , proficiency '' ) , the first consisting of the pure ideal element in action and the second the form it assumes in relation to circumstances , each of the two classes falling respectively into the two divisions of wisdom and love and of intelligence and application in the monologen , he revealed his ethical manifesto in which he proclaimed his ideas on the freedom and independence of the spirit and on the relationship of the mind to the sensual world , and he sketched his ideal of the future of the individual and of society he took a prominent part in the reorganization of the prussian church and became the most powerful advocate of the union of the lutheran and reformed divisions of german protestantism , paving the way for the prussian union of churches ( 1817 ) starting with the idea of the highest good and of its constituent elements ( güter ) , or the chief forms of the union of mind and nature , schleiermacher 's system divides itself into the doctrine of moral ends , the doctrine of virtue and the doctrine of duties ; in other words , as a development of the idea of the subjection of nature to reason it becomes a description of the actual forms of the triumphs of reason , of the moral power manifested therein and of the specific methods employed born in wrocław in the prussian silesia as the grandson of daniel schleiermacher , a pastor at one time associated with the zionites , boston collaborative encyclopedia of western theology : friedrich daniel ernst schleiermacher ( 1768–1834 ) and the son of gottlieb schleiermacher , a reformed church chaplain in the prussian army , schleiermacher started his formal education in a moravian school at niesky in upper lusatia , and at barby near magdeburg while he preached every sunday , schleiermacher also gradually took up in his lectures in the university almost every branch of theology and philosophy : new testament exegesis , introduction to and interpretation of the new testament , ethics ( both philosophic and christian ) , dogmatic and practical theology , church history , history of philosophy , psychology , dialectics ( logic and metaphysics ) , politics , pedagogy , aesthetics and translation the same year , schleiermacher lost his only son , nathaniel ( 1820–1829 ) , a blow that he said '' drove the nails into his own coffin '' , but he continued to defend his theological position against hengstenberg 's party and the rationalists daniel georg konrad von cölln ( 1788–1833 ) and david schulz ( 1779–1854 ) , protesting against both subscription to the ancient creeds and the imposition of a new rationalistic formulary strictly speaking , the antitheses of good and bad and of free and necessary have no place in an ethical system , but simply in history , which is obliged to compare the actual with the ideal , but as far as the terms '' good '' and '' bad '' are used in morals they express the rule or the contrary of reason , or the harmony or the contrary of the particular and the general feeling in this higher sense ( as distinguished from '' organic '' sensibility , empfindung ) , which is the minimum of distinct antithetic consciousness , the cessation of the antithesis of subject and object , constitutes likewise the unity of our being , in which the opposite functions of cognition and volition have their fundamental and permanent background of personality and their transitional link schleiermacher continued with his translation of plato and prepared a new and greatly-altered edition of his christlicher glaube , anticipating the latter in two letters to his friend gottfried lücke ( in the studien und kritiken , 1829 ) in which he defended his theological position generally and his book in particular against opponents on both the right and the left though the work added to the reputation of its author , it aroused the increased opposition of the theological schools it was intended to overthrow , and at the same time , schleiermacher 's defence of the right of the church to frame its own liturgy in opposition to the arbitrary dictation of the monarch or his ministers brought him fresh troubles moral functions can not be performed by the individual in isolation but only in his relation to the family , the state , the school , the church , and society — all forms of human life which ethical science finds to its hand and leaves to the science of natural history to account for in his christian ethics he dealt with the subject from the basis of the christian consciousness instead of from that of reason generally ; the ethical phenomena dealt with are the same in both systems , and they throw light on each other , while the christian system treats more at length and less aphoristically the principal ethical realities — church , state , family , art , science and society these two over-simplifications are given by schleiermacher as first , that their conscience shall be put into judgement , and second , the '' general idea turns on the fear of an eternal being , or , broadly , respect for his influence on the occurrences of this life called by you providence , or expectation of a future life after this one , called by you immortality the ontological basis of ethics is the unity of the real and the ideal , and the psychological and actual basis of the ethical process is the tendency of reason and nature to unite in the form of the complete organization of the latter by the former in politics , schleiermacher supported liberty and progress , and in the period of reaction that followed the overthrow of napoleon , he was charged by the prussian government with '' demagogic agitation '' in conjunction with the patriot ernst moritz arndt another work , grundlinien einer kritik der bisherigen sittenlehre outlines of a critique of the doctrines of morality to date ( 1803 ) , the first of his strictly critical and philosophical productions , occupied him ; it is a criticism of all previous moral systems , including those of kant and fichte : plato 's and spinoza 's find most favour the claim of schleiermacher as the father of hermeneutics seems to be justified by the fact that his work marks the beginning of hermeneutics as a general field of inquiry , separate from the specific disciplines ( e.g the work is therefore simply a description of the facts of religious feeling , or of the inner life of the soul in its relations to god , and the inward facts are looked at in the various stages of their development and presented in their systematic connection however , he attended the lectures of semler and became acquainted with the techniques of historical criticism of the new testament , and of johann augustus eberhard from whom he acquired a love of the philosophy of plato and aristotle the literary product of that period of rapid development was his influential book , reden über die religion ( on religion ) , and his '' new year 's gift '' to the new century , the monologen ( soliloquies ) it connects the moral world by a deductive process with the fundamental idea of knowledge and being ; it offers a view of the entire world of human action which at all events aims at being exhaustive ; it presents an arrangement of the matter of the science which tabulates its constituents after the model of the physical sciences ; and it supplies a sharply defined treatment of specific moral phenomena in their relation to the fundamental idea of human life as a whole it represents in his system the ideal and aim of the entire life of man , supplying the ethical view of the conduct of individuals in relation to society and the universe , and therewith constituting a philosophy of history at the same time in his earlier days he called it a feeling or intuition of the universe , consciousness of the unity of reason and nature , of the infinite and the eternal within the finite and the temporal the dutch reformed theologian herman bavinck , deeply concerned with the problem of objectivism and subjectivism in the doctrine of revelation , employs schleiermacher ’ s doctrine of revelation in his own way and regards the bible as the objective standard for his theological work the aim of the work was to reform protestant theology , to put an end to the unreason and superficiality of both supernaturalism and rationalism , and to deliver religion and theology from dependence on perpetually changing systems of philosophy this condition gives four general classes of duty : duties of general association or duties with reference to the community ( rechtspflicht ) , and duties of vocation ( berufspflicht ) — both with a universal reference , duties of the conscience ( in which the individual is sole judge ) , and duties of love or of personal association while therefore we can not , as we have seen , attain the idea of the supreme unity of thought and being by either cognition or volition , we can find it in our own personality , in immediate self-consciousness or ( which is the same in schleiermacher 's terminology ) feeling at the foundation of the university of berlin ( 1810 ) , in which he took a prominent part , schleiermacher obtained a theological chair and soon became secretary to the prussian academy of sciences at the completion of his course at halle , schleiermacher became the private tutor to the family of friedrich alexander burggraf und graf zu dohna-schlobitten ( 1741–1810 ) , developing in a cultivated and aristocratic household his deep love of family and social life after the battle of jena , he returned to berlin ( 1807 ) , was soon appointed pastor of the trinity church and , on may 18 , 1809 , married henriette von willich ( née von mühlenfels ) ( 1788–1840 ) , the widow of his friend ehrenfried von willich ( 1777–1807 ) in his system the doctrine of duty is the description of the method of the attainment of ethical ends , the conception of duty as an imperative , or obligation , being excluded , as we have seen his focus on hermeneutics as a theory of interpretation for any textual expression would be expanded even further to the theory of interpretation of lived experiences in the twentieth century by those like heidegger , gadamer , and ricoeur schleiermacher ’ s desire to approach hermeneutics in a more general sense was an attempt to shift away from more specific methods of interpretation , such as ways of interpreting biblical or classical texts , to a focus on the way in which people understand texts in general schleiermacher understood that reading a text was a discourse between the interpreter and the text itself ; however , he considered the text as the means by which the author is communicating thoughts previous to the creation of the text if a reader can understand the psyche of the author , s/he can understand the work , but only in balance with the grammatical side of interpretation , which attempts to understand the work to understand the inner thoughts of the author schleiermacher saw the ego , the person , as an individualization of universal reason ; and the primary act of self-consciousness as the first conjunction of universal and individual life , the immediate union or marriage of the universe with incarnated reason this uniformity is not based on the sameness of either the intellectual or the organic functions alone , but on the correspondence of the forms of thought and sensation with the forms of being its fundamental principle is that the source and the basis of dogmatic theology are the religious feeling , the sense of absolute dependence on god as communicated by jesus through the church , not the creeds or the letter of scripture or the rationalistic understanding universal organizing action produces the forms of intercourse , and universal symbolizing action produces the various forms of science ; individual organizing action yields the forms of property and individual symbolizing action the various representations of feeling , all these constituting the relations , the productive spheres , or the social conditions of moral action next to religion and theology , schleiermacher devoted himself to the moral world , of which the phenomena of religion and theology were , in his systems , only constituent elements the 24 years of his professional career in berlin began with his short outline of theological study ( kurze darstellung des theologischen studiums , 1811 ) in which he sought to do for theology what he had done for religion in his speeches all knowledge takes the form of the concept ( begriff ) or the judgment ( urteil ) , the former conceiving the variety of being as a definite unity and plurality , and the latter simply connecting the concept with certain individual objects every moral good or product has a fourfold character : it is individual and ' universal ; it is an organ and symbol of the reason , that is , it is the product of the individual with relation to the community , and represents or manifests as well as classifies and rules nature no action fulfills the conditions of duty except as it combines the three following antitheses : reference to the moral idea in its whole extent and likewise to a definite moral sphere ; connection with existing conditions and at the same time absolute personal production ; the fulfillment of the entire moral vocation every moment though it can only be done in a definite sphere the sum of being consists of the two systems of substantial forms and interactional relations , and it reappears in the form of concept and judgment , the concept representing being and the judgment being in action duke notes , '' it was not until heinz kimmerle 's edition , based on a careful transcription of the original handwritten manuscripts , that an assured and comprehensive overview of schleiermacher 's theory of hermeneutics became possible lacking scope for the development of his preaching skills , he sought mental and spiritual satisfaction in the city 's cultivated society and in intensive philosophical studies , beginning to construct the framework of his philosophical and religious system the relationship of the author to language is cyclical , since the author is limited by his/her language and historical context , but s/he also contributes to language as a whole through new ideas and the appropriation of language the moral process is accomplished by the various sections of humanity in their individual spheres , and the doctrine of virtue deals with the reason as the moral power in each individual by which the totality of moral products is obtained however , pietism moravian theology failed to satisfy his increasing doubts , and his father reluctantly gave him permission to enter the university of halle , which had already abandoned pietism and adopted the rationalism spirit of christian wolff and johann salomo semler on religion is divided into five major sections : the defense ( apologie ) , the nature of religion ( über das wesen der religion ) , the cultivation of religion ( über die bildung zur religion ) , association in religion ( über das gesellige in der religion , oder über kirche und priesterthum ) , and the religions ( über die religionen )
