swann writes on page 64 of the architecture of the universe ( italics indicate edits as compared to the urantia book , bolding indicates deletions ) : contrast with the urantia book ' s version : block and other believers do not see the use of the source materials as plagiarism , but express a view instead that the quality of the way the material was borrowed is consistent with authorship by celestial beings and that study of the sources leads to an even deeper understanding of the urantia book for example , meredith sprunger , a liberal believer in the urantia book and retired minister of the united church of christ , wrote that research '' has revealed that virtually all of the scientific material found in the ub was the accepted scientific knowledge of the period in which the book was written , was held by some scientists of that time , or was about to be discovered or recognized the international urantia association had twenty-six reader associations worldwide as of 2002 , and the urantia book fellowship ( formerly the urantia brotherhood , founded in 1955 with urantia foundation as the original social fraternal organization of believers ) claimed roughly twelve hundred official members , with the highest concentrations in the west of the united states and the sun belt , especially california , colorado , florida , and texas '' part iv , '' the life and teachings of jesus , '' is the largest part at 775 pages , and is often noted as the most accessible and most impressive , narrating a detailed biography of jesus that includes his childhood , teenage years , family life , and public ministry , as well as the events that led to his crucifixion , death , and resurrection the '' religion of jesus '' is considered to be practiced by way of loving god the father , thereby learning to love each person the way jesus loves people ; that is , recognizing the '' fatherhood of god and its correlated truth , the brotherhood of man , '' resulting in unselfish service to others ( in addition to the book 's '' heavy indebtedness to hopkins , '' gardner discovered that hopkins was a major reference in an earlier book authored by sadler , adding to gardner 's view that it is more likely sadler had a hand in writing or editing the urantia book than that celestial beings wrote it martin gardner considers part iv to be an especially '' well-written , impressive work , '' and says , '' either it is accurate in its history , coming directly from higher beings in position to know , or it is a work of fertile imagination by someone who knew the new testament by heart and who was also steeped in knowledge of the times when jesus lived the urantia book is approximately 2,000 pages long , and consists of a body of 196 '' papers '' divided in four parts , and an introductory foreword : part i , titled '' the central and superuniverses , '' addresses what the authors consider the highest levels of creation , including the eternal and infinity '' universal father , '' his trinity associates , and the '' isle of paradise in relation to biblical traditions , the thought adjuster is said to be the meaning behind the phrases '' being made in god 's image '' and the '' kingdom of god is within you '' : each person is said to receive one such fragment at the time of his or her first independent moral decision , on average around the age of five years and 10 months court held that , since the conduit had died prior to 1983 , only the conduit 's heirs would have been eligible to renew the copyright in 1983 and , since they had not done so , the urantia foundation 's copyright on the book had expired and the book had therefore passed into the public domain in paper 101 , '' the real nature of religion , '' the authors write : we full well know that , while the historic facts and religious truths of this series of revelatory presentations will stand on the records of the ages to come , within a few short years many of our statements regarding the physical sciences will stand in need of revision in consequence of additional scientific developments and new discoveries a smaller group of five individuals called the contact commission , including the sadlers , was responsible for gathering the questions from the forum , acting as the custodians of the handwritten manuscripts that were presented as answers , and arranging for proofreading and typing of the material lewis notes that from the perspective of the book being a '' revelation , '' it could be claimed the '' celestial beings '' simply found areas of adventist belief to be accurate and therefore presented and expanded on them '' jesus of nazareth is identified as a creator son who incarnated on earth , and the central theme of the book 's section recounting his life and teachings is that the religion he preached is the highest known to the world the book 's claimed supernatural origin has been compared to similar claims of the book of mormon , science and health , the quran , and the bible , with belief in it not being seen as necessarily a greater leap in reason since the book was determined to be in the public domain in 2001 , other organizations , such as the urantia book fellowship under the publishing name uversa press , have also published the book skeptic martin gardner , in a book otherwise highly critical of the urantia book , writes that it is '' highly imaginative '' and that the '' cosmology outrivals in fantasy the cosmology of any science-fiction work known to me the sadlers and others involved , now all deceased , claimed that the papers of the book were physically materialized from 1925 until 1935 in a way that was not understood even by them , with the first two parts being completed in 1934 and the third and fourth in 1935 gardner compares it with oahspe , noting that though oahspe is '' vastly inferior to the ub both in ideas and style of writing , '' they are similar in claiming to have been written by celestial beings channelled through a human conduit , teaching that there is '' one ultimate god who oversees a vast bureaucracy of lesser deities '' while both outline an elaborate cosmology urantia foundation , the original publisher of the urantia book , holds a united states trademark on the concentric circles , and placed a depiction of the circles on the cover of the urantia book part iii , '' the history of urantia , '' compiles a broad history of the earth , presenting a purported explanation of the origin , evolution , and destiny of the world and its inhabitants the book 's extensive teachings about the history of the world include its physical development about 4.5 billion years ago , the gradual changes in conditions that allowed life to develop , and long ages of organic evolution that started with microscopic marine life and led to plant and animal life in the oceans , later on land the adjuster then serves noncoercively as a divine partner in the mind of the individual for the rest of life , and to the extent that a person consents with their free will to want to find god , it leads the person toward more mature , spiritualized thinking urantia is said to be a markedly '' confused and disordered '' planet that is '' greatly retarded in all phases of intellectual progress and spiritual attainment '' compared to more typical inhabited worlds , due to an unusually severe history of rebellion and default by its spiritual supervisors jerry garcia was a reader of the urantia book and claimed it was '' one of his favorite esoteric works '' kerry livgren is quoted as saying , '' in 1977 , i discovered a book that convinced me i had reached the end of my quest the use of outside source materials was studied separately by gardner , and gooch , and they concluded , consistent with their respective conclusion that the book 's author ( s ) must have been human , that the book therefore plagiarized many of the sources noted by block sales by urantia foundation went from 7,000 in 1990 to 24,700 in 1997 , and steadily increased to nearly 38,000 in 2000 , an '' upturn that seems to represent a genuine trend rather than just some spike on a sales chart , '' but in 2011 the foundation reported worldwide annual sales of 16,000 copies and over 60,000 downloads from various sites he performed many of the miracles described in the bible , such as the resurrection of lazarus , the turning of water into wine , the feeding of the five thousand , and numerous healings of the blind , diseased , and infirm '' the book is strongly fideism and teaches that neither science nor logic will ever be able to prove or disprove the existence of god , arguing that faith is necessary to become conscious of god 's presence in human experience , the thought adjuster because the book is said to have been written by the revelators by 1935 while then was not being published until 1955 , discoveries from science during the two intervening decades are often declared to be prophetic by believers , while skeptics point out that edits could have been made to the book up to its 1955 publication more than one third of the content of the urantia book is devoted to a narrative of the life and teachings of jesus , and the judeo-christian tradition is given an importance exceeding any other the authors say that they were required to '' give preference to the highest existing human concepts pertaining to the subjects to be presented '' and would '' resort to pure revelation only when the concept of presentation has had no adequate previous expression by the human mind examples of criticisms regarding the science in the urantia book include : the described formation of the solar system is consistent with the chamberlin-moulton planetesimal hypothesis , which though popular in the early part of the 20th century , was discarded by the 1940s after major flaws were noted of these three , god the supreme , or '' the supreme being , '' is given the most explanation , as the person of deity evolving in time and space to unify finite reality and the infinite the only apparent anticipation of science the book has made , in gardner 's opinion , is that it says the magnetic sense that homing pigeons possess is '' not wholly wanting as a conscious possession by mankind god is described as the father of each individual , and through the direct gift of a fragment of his eternal spirit , called a thought adjuster , is said to be able to guide the individual toward an increased understanding of him in the urantia book ' s teachings , the degree to which a human mind chooses to accept its adjuster 's guidance becomes the degree to which a person 's soul '' grows '' and becomes a reality that can then survive death uniting with the adjuster fragment is the '' reward of the ages , '' the moment when a human personality has successfully and unalterably won eternal life , described as typically taking place in the afterlife , but also a possibility during earthly life ) likewise , much of the urantia book material relating to the evolution of mankind appears to have been directly taken from henry fairfield osborn , man rises to parnassus : critical epochs in the prehistory of man published by princeton university press in 1928 for example , paper 131 , '' the world 's religions '' discusses the aspects of these religions that are in common with what the book claims is the '' religion of jesus the book describes that at the center of the cosmos is the stationary isle of paradise—the dwelling place of god—with paradise being surrounded by '' havona , '' an eternal universe containing a billion perfect worlds , around which seven incomplete and evolutionary '' superuniverses '' circle mcmullan and the michael foundation subsequently sought a legal declaration that the urantia foundation 's us copyright in the urantia book was either invalid or , alternatively , that the copyright had not been infringed upon the urantia book states in its foreword that more than one thousand '' human concepts representing the highest and most advanced planetary knowledge of spiritual values and universe meanings '' were selected in preparing the papers an important symbol described in the urantia book as '' the banner of michael '' and the '' material emblem of the trinity government of all creation , '' consists of three azure blue concentric circles on a white background the authors refer to the book as the fifth revelation of '' epochal significance '' to humankind , the fourth epochal revelation having been the life of jesus '' the book regards human life on earth as a '' short and intense test , '' and the afterlife as a continuation of training that begins in material life '' the stance of the book is that there '' is not a urantia religion that could not profitably study and assimilate the best of the truths contained in every other faith many types of celestial beings are enumerated in the book , and one of particular note is a joint '' offspring '' of the universal father and eternal son called a '' creator son four years later , in 1999 , harry mcmullan iii and the michael foundation published a book , jesus–a new revelation , which included verbatim 76 of the 196 papers included in the urantia book '' the communications purportedly continued for another two decades while members of the forum studied the book in depth , and according to sadler and others , permission to publish it was given to them in 1955 in 1991 , after having compiled an index of the urantia book and distributed free copies via computer disk and printouts , kristen maaherra was sued by the urantia foundation for violating their copyright on the book '' vern grimsley was a '' dynamic speaker '' who founded a urantian outreach organization called family of god in the 1970s , which was initially supported by others in the movement , including the urantia foundation
