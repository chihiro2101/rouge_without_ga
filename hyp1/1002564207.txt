livy 's preferred version is that a public trial on the charge of perduellio was held on the orders of the quaestores parricidii caeso fabius and lucius valerius , at which cassius was condemned by the people , and subsequently by public decree his house was demolished ( being near the temple of tellus ) in the following year , titus lartius was appointed the first dictator , and as his magister equitum he nominated cassius after concluding the treaty with the hernici , cassius proposed the first agrarian law at rome , arguing for the land to be distributed amongst the plebs and the latin allies the strife between the patricians and plebeians was a recurring theme throughout the early history of the republic , and in time cost cassius his life herodotus confirms the possibility that the battles of thermopylae and salamis were fought shortly after the olympic games of that year , and only a few months after these events : '' on approach of spring , the sun suddenly quit his seat in the heavens , and disappeared '' when xerxes left sardis , a few weeks or months before crossing over to greece cassius ' first consulship was in 502 bc , the eighth year of the republic the alternative version is that cassius ' own father conducted a private trial ( presumably exercising authority as pater familias ) and put his son to death , and subsequently dedicated his son 's assets to the goddess ceres , including by dedicating a statue to her with the inscription '' given from the cassian family '' according to one tradition , cassius ' father was still living and hale at the time of his death debate and discord ensued , and the plebs turned against cassius , suspecting him of aiming at regal power livius states that the hernici agreed to surrender two thirds of their land , but a more likely explanation is that the romans , latins , and hernici agreed to share their acquired land evenly , with each receiving one third of the lands conquered by their mutual arms the historian niebuhr suggests that cassius ' sons may have been expelled by the patricians from their order , or that they or their descendants may have voluntarily passed over to the plebeians , because the patricians had shed the blood of their father in 159 bc the statue of cassius erected on the spot of his house was melted down by the censors later the same year , cassius consecrated the temple of ceres , bacchus , and proserpina on his return to rome , cassius celebrated his first triumph , which is confirmed by the fasti triumphales in contrast with his former position , cassius ratified a treaty with the latins on rome 's behalf , thereby removing one source of danger to the fledgling republic
