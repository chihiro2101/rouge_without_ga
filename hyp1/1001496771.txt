this journey takes place within a series of dream-visions ; the dreamer seeks , among other things , the allegory characters dowel ( '' do-well '' ) , dobet ( '' do-better '' ) , and dobest ( '' do-best '' ) a man named will ( which can be understood either simply as a personal name or as an allegory for a person 's will , in the sense of 'desire , intention ' ) falls asleep and has a vision of a tower set upon a hill and a fortress ( donjon ) in a deep valley ; between these symbols of heaven and hell is a 'fair field full of folk ' , representing the world of mankind passus 7 : eventually , truth sends piers a pardon for the penitents ' sins ; its main content is 'do well and have well and god shall have your soul ' and 'do evil and have evil , and expect nothing other than that after your death , the devil shall have your soul ' passus 13 : will awakens and then falls back to sleep ; he dreams of sharing a feast with conscience , scripture , clergy and patience ; he encounters a greedy doctor of divinity ( who later shows disdain for love ) and as well as eating actual food also dines on spiritual food will participates in a re-enactment of the fall of man and then has a vision of the life of christ ; when this reaches the point where the devil is defeated , will wakes up from the dream-within-a-dream this attribution rests principally on the evidence of an early-fifteenth-century manuscript of the c-text ( see below ) of piers held at trinity college , dublin ( ms 212 ) , which ascribes the work to one man , called 'willielmus de langlond ' : ; translation other manuscripts also name the author as '' robert or william langland '' , or '' wilhelmus w the attribution to william langland is also based on internal evidence , primarily a seemingly autobiographical section in passus 5 of the c-text of the poem the main narrator of the poem in all the versions is named will , with allegorical resonances clearly intended , and langland ( or longland ) is thought to be indicated as a surname through apparent puns ; e.g in their work , '' the langland myth '' , they claim there is not enough evidence to suggest that langland is , in fact , the author , but instead that it is the work of a man by the name of william de la rokele in the sixteenth century , when piers was first printed , authorship was attributed by various antiquarians ( such as john bale ) and poets to john wycliffe and geoffrey chaucer , amongst others some sixteenth- and seventeenth-century persons regarded the poem as anonymous , and/or associated it with texts in the plowman tradition of social complaint , particularly the chaucerian pseudepigrapha the ploughman 's tale and pierce the ploughman 's crede with crowley 's editions , the poem followed an existing and subsequently repeated convention of titling the poem the vision of piers or pierce plowman , which is in fact the conventional name of just one section of the poem in keeping with contemporary scholarly trends in textual criticism , critical theory , and the history of the book , charlotte brewer , among others , suggests that scribes and their supervisors be regarded as editors with semi-authorial roles in the production of piers plowman and other early modern texts , but this has nothing to do with manly 's argument 581 in the bodleian library piers plowman is considered to be one of the most analytically challenging texts in middle english textual criticism none of the texts are known to be in the author 's own hand , and none of them derive directly from any of the others skeat argued that there are as many as ten forms of the poem , but only three are to be considered authoritative & mdash ; the a , b , and c-texts & mdash ; although the definition of '' authoritative '' in this context is problematic although precise dating is debated , the a , b , and c texts are now commonly thought of as the progressive ( 20–25 & nbsp ; years ) work of a single author the b-text ( warner 's ur-b text ) was written & nbsp ; 1377–79 ; it revises a , adds new material , and is three times the length of a talbot donaldson , have maintained the basic tenets of skeat 's work : there were three final authorial texts , now lost , that can be reconstructed , albeit imperfectly and without certainty , by rooting out the '' corruption '' and '' damage '' done by scribes the kane , kane-donaldson , and russell-kane editions of the three versions , published by the athlone press , have been controversial , but are considered among the most important accomplishments in modern editorial work and theory in middle english if piers plowman already had perceived associations with lollardy , ball 's appropriations from it ( assuming he was not referring to a folk character also appropriated by langland ) enhanced his and its association with the lollards as well similarly , early in the history of the poem 's dissemination in manuscript form , piers is often treated as the author of the poem or , as the ideal character of the poem , piers might be seen as a kind of alter-ego for the poet that was more important to his early readers than the obviously authorial narrator and his apparent self-disclosures as will like william langland , who may have written the c-text version of piers plowman to disassociate himself from the rising , they look for the reform of the english church and society by the removal of abuses in what the authors deem a restorative rather than an innovative project in the passus summaries in the second and third editions , crowley emphasizes material in the poem warning of political instability and widespread corruption when the king is a child ( as was then the case ) crowley may have made small attempts to remove or soften single references to transubstantiation , the mass , purgatory , and the virgin mary as a mediator and object of devotion ( although almost a dozen references to purgatory remain , as well as three significant references to mary ) the few people who mention piers plowman before 1700 usually attribute it to someone other than langland , and often it is unclear whether they are referring to langland 's poem or one of the many other texts circulating in print as part of the piers plowman tradition , particularly the ploughman 's tale since piers was conflated with the author and dreamer-narrator of the poem at an early date , '' piers plowman '' or a latin equivalent is often given as the name of the author , which indicates unfamiliarity with , or disbelief of , crowley 's preface sometimes '' piers plowman '' was referred to as the author of the poem , and when writers refer to a list of medieval authors , they will often mention '' piers plowman '' as an author 's name or a substitute for one one gets the overall impression that langland and piers plowman had less existence as author and text than did the fictional figure of piers , whose relationship to a definite authorial and textual origin had been obscured much earlier milton cites '' chaucer 's ploughman '' in '' of reformation '' ( 1641 ) when he is discussing poems that have described constantine as a major contributor to the corruption of the church the end of piers plowman , passus 15 , makes this point at length—but it is also made briefly in one stanza in the ploughman 's tale ( ll alexander pope ( 1688–1744 ) owned a copy of rogers ' reprint of crowley 's edition of piers plowman with the crede appended , and isaac d'israeli ( 1766–1848 ) wrote in his amenities of literature that pope had '' very carefully analyzed the whole '' of the latter text with whitaker a modern editorial tradition began , with each new editor striving to present the '' authentic '' piers plowman and challenging the accuracy and authenticity of preceding editors and editions then , as before in the english reformation , this project was driven by a need for a national identity
