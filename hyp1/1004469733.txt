the william jolly bridge was constructed between 1928 and 1932 following the formation of greater brisbane in 1925 , and was one of the first major capital works of the new brisbane city council and bears the name of its first mayor , william jolly at the time of construction , the only traffic bridge linking the brisbane cbd and south brisbane was the second victoria bridge , built in 1897 to replace an earlier bridge washed away in the flood of 1893 the william jolly bridge crosses the brisbane river at the tip of the south brisbane peninsula between grey street , south brisbane , and at north quay at the intersection of skew and saul streets on the northern bank prior to european settlement , the whole of the south brisbane peninsula was known as kurilpa , meaning the place of rats , due to the large number of bush rats to be found in the lush vegetation of the area for over 30 years this was the only vehicular ferry crossing to north brisbane ( as the brisbane cbd was then known ) in this area , except for a brief period from june 1865-november 1867 when a temporary timber bridge , which was rapidly destroyed by marine borer , spanned the river first brisbane burial ground had been established on the northern bank where skew street is now located , ( later moved to hale street where it became known as paddington cemetery , site now partially occupied by suncorp stadium ) , and to the rear of the burial ground a new gaol was established by 1860 and military barracks in 1864 the extension on the main line railway from ipswich to brisbane in 1875 isolated the strip of riverfront residences from the working-class houses in milton and paddington , and this contributed to the relative lack of development along the northern bank of the milton reach of the river in subsequent years the opening of the victoria bridge on 15 june 1874 provided an important transport and communications link between the north and south banks of the river , and provided further impetus to the development of the south bank a series of 1893 brisbane flood resulted in the collapse of the albert rail bridge at indooroopilly in 1893 , which diverted all rail traffic to south brisbane , and the collapse of victoria bridge on 6 february 1893 which cut vital transport and communications links with the central city the grey street bridge was conceived as a bypass for motor traffic between the southern suburbs and western suburbs of brisbane to avoid increasing traffic congestion on the victoria bridge and on cbd streets such as george street the victoria bridge also contributed to traffic congestion in the brisbane cbd as all traffic between the suburbs on the north and south sides of the river had to pass through the cbd the victoria bridge structure was investigated in 1923 to determine its strength for further loading , and walter james doak , bridge engineer of the queensland railways , noted that the bridge is now loaded to rather more than its orthodox capacity under live load , but it was considered that there was no immediate danger of collapse a bridge at grey street would be a bypass for motor traffic between the southern suburbs and western suburbs of brisbane to avoid increasing traffic congestion on the victoria bridge and on cbd streets such as george street a crossing at kangaroo point ( where the story bridge was later built ) was estimated to cost 6 times the grey street crossing , and further reports were commissioned from william john earle , the city planner , and eneas fraser gilchrist , the city engineer these reports proposed the grey street bridge be two level for road and rail traffic , and a second bridge from wellington road to sydney street , new farm , with a major ring road called the main parkway boulevard , be constructed however , gilchrist avenue ( named after ef gilchrist city engineer ) , which is on the other side of the rail line to the proposed main parkway boulevard , is in essence part of the proposed traffic system for the grey street bridge as per earle 's recommended ring road system the final decision of the type of bridge , from the five under consideration , was essentially aesthetic , and was influenced by the so-called rainbow arch bridge , carrying robert street , st paul , minnesota across the mississippi river harding frew acknowledged this in his report , including photographs of the bridge , and stated that : '' the time has come when some improvement in the appearance of our city bridges should be looked for in queensland the council resumed large areas of land bounded by roma , saul and skew streets , and between skew street , eagle terrace and north quay on the northern side , and on the southern side , east of grey street between montague road and melbourne street an artist 's impression at the time of construction shows trams crossing the bridge with overhead cables , a monument of some kind at the intersection of skew and saul streets , and a different number of viaducts on southern side to those actually built tugs managed to pull it out eventually , but the rising tide could have dislodged a span of the bridge and dumped it in the river , and this was highlighted in the press at the time piles were driven immediately to the south of the pier , but it became impossible to drive them into the rock and the design was changed to utilise reinforced concrete caissons ( heavy , hollow , vertical reinforced concrete cylinders ) , and the contractor was noted as being completely in accord with this decision the foundations for the bridge were very deep , and the experience gained in the construction of this bridge , and later the story bridge , was considered of great value and to be a major achievement the steelwork was encased in gunite , a sprayed dry mix concrete , the process of which was based on an invention in the united states at turn of century to spray plaster-of-paris in the reconstruction of skeletons of prehistoric animals the process involves a mixture of sand and cement which is loaded into one chamber , a stream of the dry mixture is forced along a delivery pipe to the gun , and on discharge is mixed with an annular jet of water it would appear that the use of gunite in the arches , beams , deck members and hangers of the main spans , is a major early use of the process in australia '' the southern approach of the bridge , to the south of montague road , was designed to have wider footpaths and roadway than the remainder of the bridge to conform with the decision of the council to utilise this portion of the approach , so that access might be had to abutting buildings ( directly ) from the bridge roadway it was the era of the great depression and massive public works , and vida lahey , a distinguished queensland artist , painted the bridge at least three times during its construction the bridge was designed to alleviate the traffic on the victoria bridge , but by as early as 1939 it was carrying 45 % of the cross river traffic and was effectively doing more than it was designed to achieve the greater brisbane act gave the council a charter which vested in the council the power to frame its own legislation and the council proceeded with a bold policy of civic improvements , including the grey street bridge , the newbrisbane city hall , anzac square , the tramways , water supply and sewerage the william jolly bridge crosses the brisbane river at the tip of the south brisbane peninsula between grey street , south brisbane , and north quay at the intersection of skew and saul streets on the northern bank to achieve this , the bridge was constructed with three major spans of arched ribs across the river , with two smaller arches at the northern embankment and a single arch at the southern embankment , and a viaduct consisting of 16 spans ramping down to grey street to the south although designed to reduce congestion on the existing victoria bridge and within the cbd , the bridge created new congestion issues of its own , as it put considerable pressure on the normanby fiveways intersection making it one of brisbane 's most congested and dangerous intersections the go between bridge , opened in 2010 , was intended to relieve some of the congestion on the william jolly bridge ; however it has not achieve the level of use anticipated and operates under capacity , possibly because the go between bridge is a toll bridge while the nearby william jolly bridge remains free to use the william jolly bridge was constructed between 1928 and 1932 following the formation of greater brisbane in 1925 , and was one of the first major capital works of the new city council being part of a bold policy of civic improvements under the provisions of the greater brisbane act the construction of the bridge was seen as a symbol of the unification of greater brisbane , and the bridge bears the name of the new city council 's first mayor , and later lord mayor , william alfred jolly , who was chairman of the bridges and ferries committee and who had moved the motions which led to the construction of the bridge the william jolly bridge is located at the tip of the south brisbane peninsula , a location which traditionally has been a point of crossing of the brisbane river from pre-european settlement the design of the bridge is unusual in its use of three major spans of arched ribs which rise through the deck , which give the bridge a distinctive appearance and a landmark quality the design of the bridge is unusual in its use of three major spans of arched ribs which rise through the deck , which give the bridge a distinctive appearance and a landmark quality the william jolly bridge demonstrates a high degree of technical achievement in its design , its use of gunite ( sprayed dry mix concrete ) , and in the development of the sand island method used for the construction of its river piers the william jolly bridge was designed by ae harding frew , a distinguished brisbane engineer , and was a major work by queensland contractors evans deakin and co and mr hornibrook ltd
