wood , empire of liberty : a history of the early republic , 1789–1815 ( oxford history of the united states ) starting with the 1796 election , congressional party or a state legislature party caucus selected the party 's presidential candidates in 1910 , oregon became the first state to establish a presidential preference primary , which requires delegates to the national convention to support the winner of the primary at the convention a large number of states , faced with the need to conform to more detailed rules for the selection of national delegates , chose a presidential primary as an easier way to come into compliance with the new national democratic party rules to retain its tradition as the first primary in the country ( and adhere to a state law which requires it to be ) , new hampshire moved their primary forward , from early march to early january a major reason states try to increase their influence , and vie for earlier primaries , is that in recent years the races have usually been decided before the primary season has ended in june in response , other states also changed their primary election dates for 2012 , in order to claim a greater influence , creating a cascade of changes in other states senate majority leader and nevada senator harry reid was a major proponent of moving that state 's caucuses to january , arguing that nevada would be the perfect american microcosm : its western location , significant minority population , and strong labor population would be more representative of the country as a whole than iowa and new hampshire both parties then enacted stricter timing rules for 2016 : primaries and caucuses can not start until february 1 ; and only iowa , new hampshire , south carolina and nevada are entitled to february contests in the two major party 's rules , '' territories '' are referred to as '' states '' , which can be carried over in discussion and media implying there are more than 50 states both major political parties of the u.s.—the democratic party and the republican party—officially nominate their candidate for president at their respective national conventions the results of the presidential primaries and caucuses bind many of these delegates , known as pledged delegates , to vote for a particular candidate in democratic primaries through 2016 , about 85 % of delegates to the democratic national convention are '' pledged delegates '' who are apportioned to candidates according to the results of primaries and caucuses , senators and representatives ) , former and current democratic presidents and vice presidents , and a few leaders of democratic national committee-affiliated organizations , such as the young democrats of america ) who can vote for whomever they wish nearly all states have a binding primary or caucus , in which the results of the election depending on state law or party rules legally bind some or all of the delegates to vote for a particular candidate at the national convention , for a certain number of ballots or until the candidate releases the delegates some states may use a binding walking subcaucus system , where voters may instead be choosing pledged delegates to a local , county or state party convention , which then in turn selects pledged delegates to the national convention a handful of states may also practice non-binding '' beauty contests '' , which are public opinion surveys for use by caucus delegates to select candidates to a state convention , which then in turn selects delegates to the national convention in some states , a semi-closed primary is practiced , in which voters unaffiliated with a party ( independents ) may choose a party primary in which to vote a semi-open primary occurs when a voter must choose a party-specific ballot to cast , instead of being provided a single ballot where the voter must choose on the ballot itself which party 's primary to vote in in all of these systems , a voter may participate in only one primary ; that is , a voter who casts a vote for a candidate standing for the republican nomination for president can not cast a vote for a candidate standing for the democratic nomination , or vice versa both the democratic party and the republican party usually modify their delegate selection rules between presidential elections , including how delegates are allocated to each state and territory under the current democratic party selection rules , adopted in 2006 , pledged delegates are selected under proportional representation , which requires a candidate have a minimum of 15 % of a state 's popular vote to receive delegates each state publishes a delegate selection plan that notes the mechanics of calculating the number of delegates per congressional district , and how votes are transferred from local conventions to the state and national convention is based on two main factors : ( 1 ) the proportion of votes each state gave to the democratic candidate in the last three presidential elections , and ( 2 ) the number of electoral votes each state has in the united states electoral college states and territories get bonus delegates based on whether it ( if applicable ) has a republican governor , it has gop majorities in one or all chambers of its state legislature , whether one or both of its u.s because of possible deaths , resignations , or the results of intervening or special elections , the final number of these superdelegates may not be known until the week of the convention if no single candidate has secured a majority of delegates ( including both pledged and unpledged ) during the first vote , then a '' brokered convention '' results a customary ceremonial practice has been for the losing candidate ( s ) in the primary season to '' release '' their delegates at the convention and exhort them to vote for the winning nominee as a sign of party unity for example , during the 2008 democratic national convention , hillary clinton ( who only captured about 22 % of delegates compared to barack obama 's approximate 72 % ) moved to nominate obama by acclamation , making it a unanimous vote this is largely because federal campaign finance laws including the federal election campaign act state that a candidate who intends to receive contributions aggregating in excess of 5,000 or make expenditures aggregating in excess of 5,000 , among others , must first file a statement of candidacy with the federal election commission during the first six months of the year , primaries and caucuses are separately held in each of the 50 states ; the washington , d.c , and each of the five permanently inhabited us territories of american samoa , guam , the northern mariana islands , puerto rico , and the us virgin islands each party sets its own calendar and rules , and in some cases actually administers the election in some cases , state law determines how delegates will be awarded and who may participate in the primary ; where it does not , party rules prevail in reaction to these moves , both the democratic and republican national committees imposed a timing adjustment of scheduling rules , stripping states of delegates if they move their primaries early , such as the case in both the florida democratic primary and the florida republican primary in 2008 the first binding event , in which a candidate can secure convention delegates , is traditionally the iowa caucus , usually held in late january or early february of the presidential election year '' the iowa caucuses are not considered to be '' a similar election '' under new hampshire 's law because the former uses caucuses instead of primary elections in 1992 , then-governor bill clinton 's better-than-expected second-place finish in new hampshire salvaged his campaign and he went on to win the democratic party 's presidential nomination , following on to be elected president with a 43 % plurality in the 2004 primaries , john kerry , whose campaign had been sagging in prior months , won the democratic party 's iowa caucus while john edwards unexpectedly finished second , over heavily favored howard dean and dick gephardt ( the latter two had been trading negative attacks in the weeks leading up to the vote ) in 2008 , john mccain , initially struggling among republican party contenders in 2007 , decided to skip iowa and concentrate on new hampshire ( the same primary where he had unexpectedly triumphed back in 2000 ) and mccain 's win rejuvenated his presidential campaign and he became the republican nominee in 2012 , mitt romney was initially reported to be the first republican party non-incumbent presidential candidate , since the iowa caucus started in 1976 , to win both the iowa caucus ( albeit , by an 8-vote margin over rick santorum ) and new hampshire primary for the republicans , it is considered a '' firewall '' to protect establishment favorites and frontrunners in the presidential nomination race , being designed to stop the momentum of insurgent candidates who could have received a boost from strong showings in iowa and new hampshire because they are the states that traditionally hold their respective contests first , the iowa caucuses and the new hampshire primary usually attract the most media attention ; however , critics , such as mississippi secretary of state eric clark and tennessee senator william brock , point out that these states are not representative of the united states as a whole : they are overwhelmingly white , more rural , and wealthier than the national average , and neither is in the fast-growing west or south conversely , states that traditionally hold their primaries in june , like california ( the most populous state overall ) and new jersey ( the most densely populated state ) , usually end up having no say in who the presidential candidate will be california lawmakers stated that consolidating their presidential and statewide primary election in june saves them about 100 million , and that it is not worth the cost when there is generally no competitive balance between the two political parties within california in 2005 , the primary commission of the democratic national committee began considering removing iowa and new hampshire from the top of the calendar , but this proposal never gained approval , so those two states remain as the first two contests states vie for earlier primaries to claim greater influence in the nomination process , as the early primaries can act as a signal to the nation , showing which candidates are popular and giving those who perform well early on the advantage of the bandwagon effect national party leaders also have an interest in compressing the primary calendar , as it enables the party to reduce the chance of a bruising internecine battle and to preserve resources for the general campaign political commentator susan estrich argued in 1981 that these delegates , who at the time were predominantly white and male , had more power than other delegates because of their greater freedom to vote as they wish the democratic party in particular has faced accusations that it conducts its nominating process in an undemocratic way , because superdelegates are generally chosen without regard to their preferences in the presidential race and are not obligated to support the candidate chosen by the voters the national association of secretaries of state has endorsed a rotating regional primary system , with the country split into four regions : the west , the midwest , the south , and the northeast author and political scientist larry sabato is also a proponent of this plan , but his proposal would have the order of regional primaries determined by lottery on january 1 of each presidential election year instead of on a rotating basis criticisms of the regional plan include the higher entry costs than the other plans ( since 1/4 of the country would vote in the first regional ) , and the political bias of certain regions ( the south or the northeast ) unduly influencing the selection of a nominee in the 2008 republican primary , states that ran early primaries were punished by a reduction of 50 % in the number of delegates they could send to the national convention extension of this idea would set timing tiers , under which states that ran earlier primaries would send proportionally fewer delegates to the national convention , and states that waited would get a higher proportional number of delegates to the convention the disadvantage of the timing adjustment method is that it does not reduce travel time as the regional plans do , although it does permit regional groups of states to voluntarily clump together in a single superprimary as they have done in the past ;
