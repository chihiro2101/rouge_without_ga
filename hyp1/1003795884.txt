cantharidin , from the greek kantharis , for beetle , is an odorless , colorless natural product with solubility in various organic solvents , but only slight solubility in water preparations made from spanish fly have been used since ancient times as an aphrodisiac , possibly because their physical effects were perceived to mimic those of sexual arousal , john l taberner , aphrodisiacs : the science and the myth , springer science & business media , 2012 , pp.100ff these preparations were known as cantharides , from the greek word for '' beetle '' examples of such use found in historical sources include : the ancient roman historian tacitus relates that a cantharid preparation was used by the empress livia , wife of augustus caesar to entice members of the imperial family or dinner guests to commit sexual indiscretions ( thus providing her information to hold over them ) the french surgeon ambroise paré ( 1510–1590 ) described a case in 1572 of a man suffering from '' the most frightful satyriasis '' after taking a potion composed of nettles and a cantharid extract this is perhaps the same man of whom paré relates that a courtesan sprinkled a cantharid powder on food she served to him , after which the man experienced '' violent priapism '' and anal bleeding , of which he later died police searches in connection with a rash of poisonings around 1680 turned up many stashes of '' bluish flies '' which were known to be used in the preparation of aphrodisiac potions the french writer donatien alphonse françois ⁠— ⁠notoriously known as the marquis de sade ( 1740–1814 ) ⁠— ⁠is said to have given aniseed-flavored pastilles laced with spanish fly to two prostitutes at an orgy in 1772 , poisoning and nearly killing them as late as 1892 andrew taylor still , the founder of osteopathy , recommended inhaling a tincture of cantharidin as an effective preventative and treatment for smallpox , decrying vaccination he demonstrated that it was the active principle responsible for the aggressively blister agent of the coating of the eggs of the blister beetle , and established as well that cantharidin had toxic properties comparable in degree to those of the most virulent poisons known in the 19th century , such as strychnine diluted solutions of cantharidin can be used as a topical medication to remove warts and tattoos and to treat the small papules of molluscum contagiosum poisoning from cantharidin is a significant veterinary concern , especially in horses by epicauta species ; species infesting feedstocks depend on region—e.g great bustards , a strongly polygynous bird species , are not immune to the toxicity of cantharidin ; they become intoxicated after ingesting blister beetles ; however , cantharidin has activity also against parasites that infect them as a blister agent , cantharidin has the potential to cause adverse effects when used medically ; for this reason , it has been included in a list of '' problem drugs '' used by dermatologists and emergency personnel however , when compounded properly and applied in the clinic topically by a medical provider familiar with its effects and uses , cantharidin can be safely and effectively used to treat some benign skin lesions like warts and molluscum as a result , it is illegal to sell ( or use ) cantharidin or preparations containing it without a prescription in many countries
