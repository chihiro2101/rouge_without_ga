a person is given the choice between two scenarios : one with a guaranteed payoff , and one with a risky payoff with same average value the expected payoff for both scenarios is 50 , meaning that an individual who was insensitive to risk would not care whether they took the guaranteed payment or the gamble a person is said to be : risk averse ( or risk avoiding ) - if they would accept a certain payment ( certainty equivalent ) of less than 50 ( for example , 40 ) , rather than taking the gamble and possibly receiving nothing risk loving ( or risk seeking ) – if they would accept the bet even when the guaranteed payment is more than 50 ( for example , 60 ) the smallest dollar amount that an individual would be indifferent to spending on a gamble or guarantee is called the certainty equivalent , which is also used as a measure of risk aversion the expected utility of the above bet ( with a 50 % chance of receiving 100 and a 50 % chance of receiving 0 ) is : e ( u ) ( u ( 0 ) +u ( 100 ) ) /2 , and if the person has the utility function with u ( 0 ) 0 , u ( 40 ) 5 , and u ( 100 ) 10 then the expected utility of the bet equals 5 , which is the same as the known utility of the amount 40 one solution to the problem observed by rabin is that proposed by prospect theory and cumulative prospect theory , where outcomes are considered relative to a reference point ( usually the status quo ) , rather than considering only the final wealth for example , most people prefer a certain gain of 3,000 to an 80 % chance of a gain of 4,000 when posed the same problem , but for losses , most people prefer an 80 % chance of a loss of 4,000 to a certain loss of 3,000 this result coincides with other studies , that show that neuromodulation of the same area results in participants making more or less risk averse choices , depending on whether the modulation increases or decreases the activity of the target area they are expensive , meaning that less resources are available to benefit users in other ways ( such as building a playground closer to the child 's home , reducing the risk of a road traffic accident on the way to it ) , and—some argue—children may attempt more dangerous acts , with confidence in the artificial surface one experimental study with student-subject playing the game of the tv show deal or no deal finds that people are more risk averse in the limelight than in the anonymity of a typical behavioral laboratory in line with this , studies on investor behavior find that investors trade more and more speculatively after switching from phone-based to online trading and that investors tend to keep their core investments with traditional brokers and use a small fraction of their wealth to speculate online
