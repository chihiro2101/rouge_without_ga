the proportioning of loads between the components is a design choice dictated largely by the dimensions , strength , and elasticity of the components available for construction and whether or not a design is intended to be '' self jigging '' , not requiring a complete fixture for alignment '' flying wing '' aircraft , such as the northrop yb-49 and the b-2 spirit have no separate fuselage ; instead what would be the fuselage is a thickened portion of the wing structure the fixture is then disassembled and removed from the completed fuselage shell , which is then fitted out with wiring , controls , and interior equipment such as seats and luggage bins a simple form of this used in some amateur-built aircraft uses rigid expanded foam plastic as the core , with a fiberglass covering , eliminating the necessity of fabricating molds , but requiring more effort in finishing ( see the rutan varieze ) file : airbus a340 intérieur fuselage arrière.jpg interior rear-end of the main passenger level on an airbus a340 , showing the rear bulkhead as well as a doorway opening file : boeing 747 le bourget fra 002.jpg rough boeing 747 interior airframe file : cubcrafters fuselage.jpg fuselage of a cubcrafters carbon cub file : christen.eagle.2.g-ccyo.arp.jpg the fuselage can be short , and seemingly unaerodynamic , as in this christen eagle file : glider fuselage schematic.jpg glider fuselage schematic from wings and empennage , and from discrete masses such as the engine ) is taken by the surface covering some modern aircraft are constructed with composite materials for major control surfaces , wings , or the entire fuselage such as the boeing 787 as the accuracy of the final product is determined largely by the costly fixture , this form is suitable for series production , where many identical aircraft are to be produced cabin windows , made from much lighter than glass stretched acrylic glass , consists of multiple panes : an outer one built to support four times the maximum cabin pressure , an inner one for redundancy and a scratch pane near the passenger ) thick each and are structural , while the outer ply , about 3 mm thick , is a barrier against foreign object damage and abrasion , with often a hydrophobic coating first , a series of frames in the shape of the fuselage cross sections are held in position on a rigid fixture
