the ritual as interpreted in light of such ideas does not at all bring about salvation , nor does its performance bring about the forgiveness of sins ; the forgiveness which the believer has received by faith is merely pictured , not effectively applied , by baptism ; salvation and participation in christ is memorialized ( '' this do in remembrance of me '' in the lord 's supper and baptism picturing a christian 's rebirth as death to sin and alive in christ ) , not imparted , by the eucharist tadros malaty , the divine grace pdf the holy mysteries ( latin , '' sacraments ) are seen as a means of partaking of divine grace because god works through his church , not just because specific legalistic rules are followed ; and grace is the working of god himself , not a created substance of any kind that can be treated like a commodity the former type of grace , gratia gratum faciens , in turn , can be described as sanctifying ( or habitual ) grace – when it refers to the divine life which , according to the church , infuses a person 's soul once he is justified ; or else as actual grace – when it refers to those punctual ( not habitual ) helps that are directed to the production of sanctifying grace where it does not already exist , or its maintenance and increase it where it is already present in the definition of the catechism of the catholic church , '' grace is favour , the free and undeserved help that god gives us to respond to his call to become children of god , adoptive sons , partakers of the divine nature and of eternal life '' the protestant teachings on grace suggest a question , however : what is the role of the church in the work of grace ? such reformation churches taught that salvation is not ordinarily found outside of the visible church ; but with the increasing emphasis on an experience of conversion as being necessary to salvation , sola fide began to be taken as implying that the individual 's relationship with jesus is intensely individual ; we stand alone before god according to reformed theology , the '' good news '' of the gospel of christ is that god has freely granted the gift of salvation to those the holy spirit causes to believe ; what he freely grants to some ( the '' elect '' individuals ) , he withholds from others ( the '' reprobate '' individuals ) '' september 7 , 2009 total depravity ( also known as total inability , which is inexorably tied to a strong doctrine of original sin as having enslaved the human will completely ) unconditional election limited atonement ( also known as definite atonement or particular redemption ) irresistible grace perseverance of the saints ( colloquially known as '' once saved , always saved '' or , as interpreted a distinct way among reformed or strict baptists as well as non-calvinist general baptists , eternal security ) the notion that god has foreordained who will be saved is generally called predestination concerning ephesians 2:8 which states : '' for by grace are ye saved through faith ; and that not of yourselves : it is the gift of god '' , it is noted that the word '' it '' is a pronoun and refers back to a noun the grace of justification is bestowed through the merit of christ 's passion , without any merits on the part of the person justified , who is enabled to cooperate only through the grace of god the grace of justification may be lost through mortal sin , but can also be restored by the sacrament of penance classical calvinism teaches that the sacraments are '' signs and seals of the covenant of grace '' and '' effectual means of salvation '' , and lutheranism teaches that new life , faith , and union with christ are granted by the holy spirit working through the sacraments the fatherly action of god is first on his own initiative , and then follows man 's free acting through his collaboration , so that the merit of good works is to be attributed in the first place to the grace of god , then to the faithful the catholic church holds that '' by grace alone , in faith in christ 's saving work and not because of any merit on our part , we are accepted by god and receive the holy spirit , who renews our hearts while equipping and calling us to good works the lutheran augsburg confession says of baptism , '' lutherans teach that it is necessary to salvation and that by baptism the grace of god is offered and that children are to be baptized , who by baptism , being offered to god , are received into god 's favor furthermore , as the book of james distinguishes between a dead faith ( a faith without works ) and a living faith ( a faith accompanied by works of obedience ) , it is believed that god 's gift operates through an individuals living faith resulting in that individual being saved protestantism in all three major schools of theology – lutheran , calvinist , and arminian – emphasize god 's initiative in the work of salvation , which is achieved by grace alone through faith alone , in either stream of thinking – although these terms are understood differently , according to the differences in systems john cassian , in continuity with patristic doctrine , taught that though grace is required for persons to save themselves at the beginning , there is no such thing as total depravity , but there remains a moral or noetic ability within humans that is unaffected by original sin , and that persons must work together ( synergism ) with divine grace to be saved john calvin , '' institutes of the christian religion , book 2 chapter 4 '' randy maddox , responsible grace ( kingswood , 1994 ) alister mcgrath , iustitia dei : a history of the christian doctrine of justification ( cambridge , 1998 ) glen pettigrove , '' forgiveness and grace '' , in forgiveness and love ( oxford university press , 2012 ) 124–150 grace is contrasted with the law of moses ( romans 6:14 ; hebrews 10:4 ; john 1:17 ) and the church of christ believes that paul 's contrast between work and faith is as described under the efforts to resolve the tension section , a contrast between works of the old covenant and obedient faith under the new covenant this cooperation is called synergism ( see also semipelagianism and monergism ) , so that humans may become deified in conformity to the divine likeness – a process called theosis – by merging with the uncreated energies of god ( revealed to the senses as the tabor light of transfiguration ) , notably through a method of prayer called hesychasm this is often reflected in the arrangement of the pulpit and altar at the front the church ; as preaching becomes more important , the pulpit moves from the side to the center , while the altar for the eucharist shrinks to the size of a small coffee table or is eliminated entirely as the word '' saved '' is a verb , '' it '' does not refer to '' saved '' but to grace , giving the definition of grace as '' the gift of god '' in wesley 's position , the believer who repents and accepts christ is not '' making himself righteous '' by an act of his own will , such as would alter his dependency on the grace of god for his salvation the sacraments are , together with revealed truth , the principal means of the grace , a treasury of grace , that christ has merited by his life and death and has given to the church john of kronstadt press , 1986 orthodox theologians reject augustine 's formulation of original sin and actively oppose the content and implications of john calvin 's conceptions of total depravity and irresistible grace , characteristic of reformed protestantism , as well as the thomism and scholastic theology which would become official roman catholic pedagogy until the second vatican council catholic answers , grace : what it is and what it does catholic teaching on sin & grace ( center for learning , 1997 ) , george hayward joyce , the catholic doctrine of grace ( newman , 1950 ) , '' grace hudson , '' grace alone '' both the council of orange ( 529 ) and the council of trent affirmed that we are '' justified gratuitously , because none of the things that precede justification , whether faith or works , merit the grace of justification '' when assurance of election was rigorously pressed as an experience to be sought , especially by the puritans , this led to a legalism as rigid as the one protestantism sought to reject , as men were eager to demonstrate that they were among the chosen by the conspicuous works-righteousness of their lives the council of trent declared that the free will of man , moved and excited by god , can by its consent co-operate with god , who excites and invites its action ; and that it can thereby dispose and prepare itself to obtain the grace of justification wesley taught that christian believers are to participate in what wesley called '' the means of grace '' and to continue to grow in the christian life , assisted by god 's sustaining grace since protestants accept that men are saved only and decisively by their belief in christ 's atonement , they often rank preaching that message more than sacraments which apply the promises of the gospel to them as members of the church when catholics say that persons '' cooperate '' in preparing for and accepting justification by consenting to god 's justifying action , they see such personal consent as itself an effect of grace , not as an action arising from innate human abilities good works are something the believers should undertake out of gratitude towards their savior ; but they are not sufficient for salvation and can not earn anyone salvation ; there is no room for the notion of '' merit '' in luther 's doctrine of redemption thomas aquinas in his summa theologica , grace can be given either to make the person receiving it pleasing to god ( gratia gratum faciens ) – so that the person is sanctified and justified – or else to help the receiver lead someone else to god ( gratia gratis data ) for example , in when a man is ordained a priest , the church teaches that he receives the power to confect the eucharist ( to celebrate mass ) and to forgive sins in the sacrament of reconciliation this belief finds expression in the baptist and anabaptist practice of believers baptism , given not to infants as a mark of membership in a christian community , but to adult believers after they have achieved the age of reason and have professed their faith sproul , grace unknown : the heart of reformed theology ( baker book house , 1999 ) ulasien , paul , the power of a grace perspective ( infinity , 2011 ) , philip yancey , what 's so amazing about grace ?
