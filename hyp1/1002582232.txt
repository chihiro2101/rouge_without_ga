a cbs revival of your hit parade ; and the bobby vinton show , a canada-based syndicated variety show for singer bobby vinton ( produced in conjunction with chris bearde and allan blye ) however , barris became a public figure in 1976 when he produced and served as the host of the talent show spoof the gong show , which he packaged in partnership with television producer chris bearde as with some of barris ' other projects ( including the newlywed game ) , it was at one point possible to see the gong show twice daily , a relatively uncommon feat in the years prior to cable tv 's expansion into the commercial market the original host of the nbc show was john barbour , who misunderstood the show 's concept and considered it a straight talent show , as opposed to barris ' parody concept barris dropped barbour at the last minute ;
