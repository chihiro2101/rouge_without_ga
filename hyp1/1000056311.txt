it can be found from the south of newfoundland , through nova scotia , new brunswick and southern quebec to the southwest west of ontario , extreme southeastern manitoba and northern minnesota ; southward through wisconsin , illinois , missouri , eastern oklahoma , and eastern texas in its western range ; and east to florida one study compared the sap and syrup from the sugar maple with those of the red maple , as well as those of the acer saccharinum ( silver maple ) , acer negundo ( boxelder ) , and acer platanoides ( norway maple ) , and all were found to be equal in sweetness , flavor , and quality in areas disturbed by humans where the species thrives , it can reduce diversity , but in a mature forest it is not a dominant species ; it only has a sparse presence and adds to the diversity and ecological structure of a forest the density of the tree in many of these areas has increased 6- to 7-fold , and this trend seems to be continuing , all of which is due to human factors , mainly continued heavy logging and a recent trend of young , shrubby forests recovering from past human disturbances acer rubrum does very well in a wide range of soil types , with varying textures , moisture , ph , and elevation , probably more so than any other forest tree in north america in northern michigan and new england , the tree is found on the tops of ridges , sandy or rocky upland and otherwise dry soils , as well as in nearly pure stands on moist soils and the edges of swamps while many believe that it is replacing historically dominant tree species in the eastern united states such as sugar maples , beeches , oaks , tsuga and pines , red maple will only dominate young forests prone to natural or human disturbance rubrum is not present in most of the prairie peninsula of the northern midwest ( although it is found in ohio ) , the coastal prairie in southern louisiana and southeastern texas and the swamp prairie of the florida everglades trees growing in a zone 9 or 10 area such as florida will usually die from cold damage if transferred up north , for instance to canada , maine , vermont , new hampshire and new york , even if the southern trees were planted with northern red maples however , the buds of red maple and other soft maples emerge much earlier in the spring than the sugar maple , and after sprouting chemical makeup of the sap changes , imparting an undesirable flavor to the syrup red maple is most abundant in the northeastern us , the upper peninsula of michigan , and northeastern wisconsin and is rare in the extreme west of its range and in the southeastern us here the red maple is not present in the bottom land forests of the grain belt , despite the fact it is common in similar habitats and species associations both to the north and south of this area treatment is limited and can include the use of methylene blue or mineral oil and activated carbon in order to stop further absorption of the toxin into the stomach , as well as blood transfusions , fluid support , diuretics , and anti-oxidants such as vitamin c red maple 's rapid growth , ease of transplanting , attractive form , and value for wildlife ( in the eastern us ) has made it one of the most extensively planted trees red maple is also used for the production of maple syrup , though the hard maples acer saccharum ( sugar maple ) and acer nigrum ( black maple ) are more commonly utilized in the lumber industry acer rubrum is considered a '' soft maple '' , a designation it shares , commercially , with silver maple ( a at the same time , they are tolerant of drought due to their ability to stop growing under dry conditions by then producing a second growth flush when conditions later improve , even if growth has stopped for 2 weeks its popularity in cultivation stems from its vigorous habit , its attractive and early red flowers , and most importantly , its flaming red fall foliage it grows on glaciated as well as unglaciated soils derived from the following rocks : granite , gneiss , schist , sandstone , shale , slate , conglomerate , quartzite , and limestone because it can grow on a variety of substrates , has a high ph tolerance , and grows in both shade and sun , a it is more tolerant of pollution and road salt than sugar maples , although the tree 's fall foliage is not as vibrant in this environment however , it is nonetheless common in mountainous areas on relatively dry ridges , as well as on both the south and west sides of upper slopes its ability to thrive in a large number of habitats is largely due to its ability to produce roots to suit its site from a young age red maple dominates such sites , but largely disappears until it only has a sparse presence by the time a forest is mature red maple frequently hybridizes with silver maple ; the hybrid , known as freeman 's maple , acer Ã— freemanii , is intermediate between the parents the largest known living red maple is located near armada , michigan , at a height of and a bole circumference , at breast height , of rubrums very wide range , there is significant variation in hardiness , size , form , time of flushing , onset of dormancy , and other traits red maple is a medium quality firewood , possessing less heat energy , nominally , than other hardwoods such as ash : , oak : , or birch : . saccharum , the wood of red maple is close-grained , but its texture is softer , less dense , and has not as desirable an appearance , particularly under a clear finish the trunk will remain free of branches until some distance up the tree on forest grown trees , while individuals grown in the open are shorter and thicker with a more rounded crown the tree 's thin bark is easily damaged from ice and storms , animals , and when used in landscaping , being struck by flying debris from lawn mowers , allowing fungi to penetrate and cause heart rot acer rubrum is one of the most abundant and widespread trees in eastern north america symptoms occur within one or two days after ingestion and can include depression , lethargy , increased rate and depth of breathing , increased heart rate , jaundice , dark brown urine , colic , laminitis , coma , and death in florida , at the extreme south of the red maple 's range , it is limited exclusively to swamplands it is a medium to large sized tree , reaching heights of and exceptionally over in the southern appalachians where conditions favor its growth the trunk diameter often ranges from ; depending on the growing conditions , however , open grown trees can attain diameters of up to soil acidity can influence the color of the foliage and trees with female flowers are more likely to produce orange coloration while male trees produce red red maple can grow in a variety of moist and dry biomes , from dry ridges and sunny , southwest-facing slopes to peat bogs and swamps one of its associates , the black cherry ( prunus serotina ) , contains benzoic acid , which has been shown to be a potential allelopathic inhibitor of red maple growth
