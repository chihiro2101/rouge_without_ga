aston and a preliminary suggestion by jean perrin , proposed that stars obtained their energy from nuclear fusion of hydrogen to form helium and raised the possibility that the heavier elements are produced in stars in the following decade the gamow factor was used by atkinson and houtermans and later by edward teller and gamow himself to derive the rate at which nuclear reactions would occur at the high temperatures believed to exist in stellar interiors the first one , the proton-proton chain reaction , is the dominant energy source in stars with masses up to about the mass of the sun hoyle 's theory was extended to other processes , beginning with the publication of the 1957 review paper '' synthesis of the elements in stars '' by burbidge , burbidge , fowler and hoyle , more commonly referred to as the b2fh paper this review paper collected and refined earlier research into a heavily cited picture that gave promise of accounting for the observed relative abundances of the elements ; but it did not itself enlarge hoyle 's 1954 picture for the origin of primary nuclei as much as many assumed , except in the understanding of nucleosynthesis of those elements heavier than iron by neutron capture clayton calculated the first time-dependent models of the s-process in 1961 and of the r-process in 1965 , as well as of the burning of silicon into the abundant alpha-particle nuclei and iron-group elements in 1968 , and discovered radiogenic chronologies for determining the age of the elements the most important reactions in stellar nucleosynthesis : hydrogen fusion : deuterium fusion the proton–proton chain the cno cycle helium fusion : the triple-alpha process the alpha process fusion of heavier elements : lithium burning : a process found most commonly in brown dwarfs carbon-burning process neon-burning process oxygen-burning process silicon-burning process production of elements heavier than iron : neutron capture : the r-process the s-process proton capture : the rp-process the p-process photodisintegration hydrogen fusion ( nuclear fusion of four protons to form a helium-4 nucleus ) is the dominant process that generates energy in the cores of main sequence stars the proton–proton chain reaction cycle is relatively insensitive to temperature ; a 10 % rise of temperature would increase energy production by this method by 46 % , hence , this hydrogen fusion process can occur in up to a third of the star 's radius and occupy half the star 's mass for stars above 35 % of the sun 's mass , the energy flux toward the surface is sufficiently low and energy transfer from the core region remains by radiative heat transfer , rather than by convective heat transfer in higher-mass stars , the dominant energy production process is the cno cycle , which is a catalytic cycle that uses nuclei of carbon , nitrogen and oxygen as intermediaries and in the end produces a helium nucleus as with the proton-proton chain as the star ages and the core temperature increases , the region occupied by the convection zone slowly shrinks from 20 % of the mass down to the inner 8 % of the mass in stars around the mass of the sun , this begins at the tip of the red giant branch with a helium flash from a degenerate helium core , and the star moves to the horizontal branch where it burns helium in its core the reaction rate density between species a and b , having number densities n a , b is given by : : : r n_a \ , n_b \ , k where k is the reaction rate constant of each single elementary binary reaction composing the nuclear fusion process : : : k \langle \sigma ( v ) \ , v \rangle here , σ ( v ) is the cross section at relative velocity v , and averaging is performed over all velocities
