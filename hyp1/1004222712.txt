the term was first used by in 1893 : historian manuel fernández álvarez defined a black legend as : according to historian elvira roca barea , the formation of a black legend and its assimilation by the nation that suffers it is a phenomenon observed in all multicultural empires , not just in the spanish empire the subject is portrayed as a degenerated form of another , usually another civilization , nation , religion , race or person , who represents the true , pure and noble form of whatever the subject of the black legend should have been , and that tends to coincide with whoever is building the legend the black legend has a final tone in which no hope of improvement is given , for the defects have been there from the beginning and can not be overcome due to , usually , moral weakness it is usually shown by tales with : narrations of black legends tend to include : strong pathos , combined with a narrative that is easy to follow and emotionally loaded , created by : detailed , gruesome and morbid descriptions of torture and violence , which in many cases does not seem to serve any practical purpose a theme , usually greed , cruelty , sadism or bigoty , that constructs a consistent character and remains stable through the legend , even if the specific '' proofs '' to support it may change or even become opposite to the initial ones these elements all fit the model of a black legend and can be the surviving remains of one who affected the roman empire during its life and the fall of the western roman empire , and was reverted by medieval authorities who needed the legacy of rome to legitimize their power jean-françois revel , in his book l'obsession anti-americaine describes the treatment of the us in the press of various nations in terms that remember those of a black legend , even though he does not use the term the causes of this have been suggested as : the overlap of the period of splendour of the spanish empire with the introduction of the printing press in england and germany , which allowed the propaganda of such colonial and religious rivals to spread faster and wider than ever before and persist in time long after the disappearance of the empire the hypothesis of a spanish black legend assimilating anti-hispanic propaganda from the 16th and 17th centuries has a high level of acceptance among specialists , but the extent of its reach and the data it affected , and what may have actually occurred instead , is still debated , especially regarding the spanish colonization of the americas , where few written sources have been proven reliable
