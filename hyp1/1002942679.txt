sodium calcium edetate , an edta derivative , is used to bind metal ions in the practice of chelation therapy , such as for treating mercury and lead poisoning this conversion is achieved by oxidising the hydrogen sulfide to elemental sulfur , which is non-volatile : :2 & nbsp ; fe ( edta ) − + h 2 s → 2 & nbsp ; fe ( edta ) 2− + s + 2 & nbsp ; h + in this application , the iron ( iii ) centre is redox to its iron ( ii ) derivative , which can then be reoxidised by air in the laboratory , edta is widely used for scavenging metal ions : in biochemistry and molecular biology , ion depletion is commonly used to deactivate metalloenzymes , either as an assay for their reactivity or to suppress damage to dna , proteins , and polysaccharides edta forms especially strong complexes with mn ( ii ) , copper , fe ( iii ) , lead and co ( iii ) to describe edta and its various protonation , chemists distinguish between edta 4− , the conjugate base that is the ligand , and h 4 edta , the precursor to that ligand candidate chelating agents include nitrilotriacetic acid ( nta ) , iminodisuccinic acid ( ids ) , polyaspartic acid , s , s-ethylenediamine-n , n′-disuccinic acid ( edds ) , methylglycinediacetic acid ( mgda ) , and l -glutamic acid n , n-diacetic acid , tetrasodium salt ( glda ) first , because of its high denticity , this ligand has a high affinity for metal cations : : fe ( h 2 o ) 6 3+ + h 4 edta fe ( edta ) − + 6 & nbsp ; h 2 o + 4 & nbsp ; h + k eq 10 25.1 written in this way , the equilibrium quotient shows that metal ions compete with protons for binding to edta this route yields the tetrasodium edta , which is converted in a subsequent step into the acid forms : : h 2 nch 2 ch 2 nh 2 + 4 & nbsp ; formaldehyde + 4 & nbsp ; nacn + 4 & nbsp ; h 2 o → ( nao 2 cch 2 ) 2 nch 2 ch 2 n ( ch 2 co 2 na ) 2 + 4 & nbsp ; ammonia : ( nao 2 cch 2 ) 2 nch 2 ch 2 n ( ch 2 co 2 na ) 2 + 4 & nbsp ; hcl → ( ho 2 cch 2 ) 2 nch 2 ch 2 n ( ch 2 co 2 h ) 2 + 4 & nbsp ; nacl this process is used to produce about 80,000 & nbsp ; tonnes of edta each year degradation of feedta , but not edta itself , produces iron complexes of the triacetate ( ed3a ) , diacetate ( edda ) , and monoacetate ( edma ) – 92 % of edda and edma biodegrades in 20 hours while ed3a displays significantly higher resistance the pk a values of free edta are 0 , 1.5 ( deprotonation of the two amino groups ) , 2 , 2.66 , 6.16 and 10.24 ( deprotonation of the four carboxyl groups ) mgda has been shown to be an effective chelating agent , with a capacity for mobilization comparable with that of nitrilotriacetic acid ( nta ) , with application to water for industrial use and for the removal of calcium oxalate from urine from patients with kidney stones in the movie blade ( 1998 ) , edta is used as a weapon to kill vampires , exploding when in contact with vampire blood in evaluating kidney function , the chromium complex cr ( edta ) − ( as radioactive chromium-51 ( 51 cr ) ) is administered intravenously and its filtration into the urine is monitored in tissue culture edta is used as a chelating agent that binds to calcium and prevents joining of cadherins between cells , preventing clumping of cells grown in liquid suspension , or detaching adherent cells for passaging in analytical chemistry , edta is used in complexometric titrations and analysis of water hardness or as a masking agent to sequester metal ions that would interfere with the analyses in shampoos , cleaners , and other personal care products , edta salts are used as a sequestering agent to improve their stability in air in this article , the term edta is used to mean h 4−x edta x− , whereas in its complexes edta 4− stands for the tetraanion ligand agrobacterium radiobacter only degrades fe ( iii ) edta while bnc1 and dsm 9103 are not capable of degrading iron ( iii ) edta and are more suited for calcium , barium , magnesium and manganese complexes in histopathology , edta can be used as a decalcifying agent making it possible to cut sections using a microtome once the tissue sample is demineralised . also today , edta is mainly synthesised from ethylenediamine ( 1,2-diaminoethane ) , formaldehyde , and sodium cyanide in a similar manner , edta is added to some food as a preservative or stabiliser to prevent catalytic oxidative decolouration , which is catalysed by metal ions aqueous fe ( edta ) − is used for removing ( '' scrubbing '' ) hydrogen sulfide from gas streams the s , s isomer of edta , edds ( edds ) is readily biodegradable and exhibits a high rate biodegradation in the pulp and paper industry , edta inhibits the ability of metal ions , especially manganese , from catalysing the disproportionation of hydrogen peroxide , which is used in totally chlorine free
