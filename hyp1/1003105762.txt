vermeij , the rise of ocean giants : maximum body size in cenozoic marine mammals as an indicator for productivity in the pacific and atlantic oceans , published 5 july 2016.doi : 10.1098/rsbl.2016.0186 a desmostylian skull has an elongated and broadened rostrum , with the nasal opening located slightly dorsally the zygomatic arches are prominent ( behind the eyes ) , the paroccipital processes elongated ( downward-pointing processes behind the jaw-joints ) , and the epitympanic sinuses open into the temporal fossae ( cavities above the ear holes ) the cusps of the premolars and molars are composed of densely packed cylinders of thick enamel , giving the order its name ( '' bundle of columns '' ) their name refers to their highly distinctive molars , in which each cusp was modified into hollow columns , so a typical molar would have resembled a cluster of pipes , or in the case of worn molars , volcanoes ( this may reflect the close relationship between the paenungulata , to which this group has been assigned , and the tubulidentata based on a comparison of trunk and limb proportions , concluded that desmostylians were more terrestrial than aquatic and clearly fore limb-dominated swimmers , hence they were more similar to '' sea bears '' than '' sea sloths '' ( as proposed by other researchers desmostylian fossils are known from the northern pacific rim , from southern japan through russia , the aleutian islands , and the pacific coast of north america to the southern tip of baja california natural history museum of los angeles county contributions in science , ( 521 ) , 51â€“114 both desmostylians and north pacific dugongids were apparently kelp specialists , as opposed to marine herbivorous mammals from other regions , with diets primarily composed of seagrass the discovery of a complete skeleton from sakhalin island in 1941 , however , showed that they possessed four legs , with bones as stout as a hippopotamus ' , and justified the creation of a new order for the desmostylians , described by proposed a new classification of paleoparadoxiidae : order desmostylia reinhart , 1953 family paleoparadoxiidae reinhart , 1959 subfamily behemotopsinae ( inuzuka , 1987 ) behemotops domning , ray , and mckenna , 1986 behemotops proteus domning , ray , and mckenna , 1986 ( including behemotops emlongi domning , ray , and mckenna , 1986 ) behemotops katsuiei inuzuka , 2000b subfamily paleoparadoxiinae ( reinhart , 1959 ) archaeoparadoxia archaeoparadoxia weltoni ( clark , 1991 ) paleoparadoxia reinhart , 1959 paleoparadoxia tabatai ( tokunaga , 1939 ) , ( paleoparadoxia media inuzuka , 2005 ) neoparadoxia barnes 2013 neoparadoxia repenningi ( domning and barnes , 2007 ) neoparadoxia cecilialina barnes 2013
