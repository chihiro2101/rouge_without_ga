as basic axioms of the provability logic gl ( gödel-löb ) , which captures provable in peano arithmetic , one takes modal analogues of the hilbert-bernays derivability conditions and löb 's theorem ( if it is provable that the provability of a implies a , then a is provable ) in response to this , stanisław jaśkowski ( 1929 ) and gerhard gentzen ( 1934 ) independently provided such systems , called calculi of natural deduction , with gentzen 's approach introducing the idea of symmetry between the grounds for asserting propositions , expressed in introduction rules , and the consequences of accepting propositions in the elimination rules , an idea that has proved very important in proof theory although the formalisation of logic was much advanced by the work of such figures as gottlob frege , giuseppe peano , bertrand russell , and richard dedekind , the story of modern proof theory is often seen as being established by david hilbert , who initiated what is called hilbert 's program in the foundations of mathematics other research in provability logic has focused on first-order provability logic , japaridze 's polymodal logic ( with one modality representing provability in the object theory and another representing provability in the meta-theory ) , and interpretability logics intended to capture the interaction between provability and interpretability other research topics in structural theory include analytic tableau , which apply the central idea of analytic proof from structural proof theory to provide decision procedures and semi-decision procedures for a wide range of logics , and the proof theory of substructural logics barkley rosser 's refinement , weakening the above requirement of ω-consistency to simple consistency ; axiomatisation of the core of gödel 's result in terms of a modal language , provability logic ; transfinite iteration of theories , due to alan turing and solomon feferman ; the discovery of self-verifying theories , systems strong enough to talk about themselves , but too weak to carry out the diagonal lemma that is the key to gödel 's unprovability argument the three most well-known styles of proof calculi are : the hilbert system the natural deduction calculi the sequent calculi each of these can give a complete and axiomatic formalization of propositional or predicate logic of either the classical or intuitionistic flavour , almost any modal logic , and many substructural logics , such as relevance logic or linear logic the central idea of this program was that if we could give finitary proofs of consistency for all the sophisticated formal theories needed by mathematicians , then we could ground these theories by means of a metamathematical argument , which shows that all of their purely universal assertions ( more technically their provable arithmetical hierarchy ) are finitarily true ; once so grounded we do not care about the non-finitary meaning of their existential theorems , regarding these as pseudo-meaningful stipulations of the existence of ideal entities consequences of ordinal analysis include ( 1 ) consistency of subsystems of classical second order arithmetic and set theory relative to constructive theories , ( 2 ) combinatorial independence results , and ( 3 ) classifications of provably total recursive functions and provably well-founded ordinals structural proof theory is connected to type theory by means of the curry–howard correspondence , which observes a structural analogy between the process of normalisation in the natural deduction calculus and beta reduction in the typed lambda calculus . gentzen ( 1934 ) further introduced the idea of the sequent calculus , a calculus advanced in a similar spirit that better expressed the duality of the logical connectives , girard , lafont , and taylor ( 1988 ) the reverse mathematics program was foreshadowed by results in set theory such as the classical theorem that the axiom of choice and zorn 's lemma are equivalent over zf set theory jan łukasiewicz suggested in 1926 that one could improve on hilbert systems as a basis for the axiomatic presentation of logic if one allowed the drawing of conclusions from assumptions in the inference rules of the logic in reverse mathematics , one starts with a framework language and a base theory—a core axiom system—that is too weak to prove most of the theorems one might be interested in , but still powerful enough to develop the definitions necessary to state these theorems reverse mathematics is a program in mathematical logic that seeks to determine which axioms are required to prove theorems of mathematics for each theorem that can be stated in the base system but is not provable in the base system , the goal is to determine the particular axiom system ( stronger than the base system ) that is necessary to prove that theorem much of the interest in cut-free proofs comes from the subformula property : every formula in the end sequent of a cut-free proof is a subformula of one of the premises the failure of the program was induced by kurt gödel 's incompleteness theorems , which showed that any ω-consistent theory that is sufficiently strong to express certain simple arithmetic truths , can not prove its own consistency , which on gödel 's formulation is a \pi^0_1 sentence the ability to transform a proof system into a focused form is a good indication of its syntactic quality , in a manner similar to how admissibility of cut shows that a proof system is syntactically consistent for example , to study the theorem '' every bounded sequence of real numbers has a supremum '' it is necessary to use a base system that can speak of real numbers and sequences of real numbers the goal of reverse mathematics , however , is to study possible axioms of ordinary theorems of mathematics rather than possible axioms for set theory
