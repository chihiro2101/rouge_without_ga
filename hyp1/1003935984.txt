whether the fluid is secreted by the skene 's gland through and around the urethra has also been a topic of discussion ; while the exact source and nature of the fluid remain controversial among medical professionals , and are related to doubts over the existence of the g-spot , there is substantial evidence that the skene 's gland is the source of female ejaculation in these research publications , it is suggested that '' real '' female ejaculation is the release of a very scanty , thick , and whitish fluid from the female prostate , while the '' squirting '' or '' gushing '' ( shown frequently in pornography ) is a different phenomenon : the expulsion of clear and abundant fluid , which has been shown to be a diluted fluid from the urinary bladder often the debate is also tied to the existence of the g-spot ; stimulation of the anterior vaginal wall simultaneously stimulates the para-urethral tissue ( the site of the skene 's glands and ducts , and a proposed likely source of ejaculation fluid ) , and so has been suggested as the trigger of ejaculation anatomical knowledge was also advanced by alexander skene 's description of para-urethral or periurethral glands ( glands around the urethra ) in 1880 , which have been variously claimed to be one source of the fluids in the ejaculate , and now commonly referred to as the skene 's glands the history of female ejaculation series by mark zedler , the mysterious world of female ejaculation electronic journal of human sexuality : urethral expulsions during sensual arousal and bladder catheterization in seven human females by gary schubach ( '' female ejaculation '' bibliography ) an annotated bibliography on sexual arousal , orgasm , and female ejaculation in humans and animals the terminology ( such as female prostate and female ejaculation ) invoke images of the female as merely an imitation of the male , mapping the female body onto the male , as if , like the galenic view , it was incomplete he appears to identify skene 's ducts , when he writes xiii : 213 '' those ducts which are visible around the orifice of the neck of the vagina and the outlet of the urinary passage receive their fluid from the female 'parastatae ' , or rather the thick membranous body around the urinary passage in the united kingdom , the british board of film classification has requested cuts to pornographic films alleged to show female ejaculation , claiming that the expert medical advice it received was that there is no such thing as female ejaculation , and therefore the films showed urolagnia bell further questions why feminists have not been more outspoken in defense of women 's control over female ejaculation , pointing out that the literature frames the discussion in only five separate ways ; procreation , sexual pleasure , deviance , pathology , and a scientific mystery the debate in the current literature focuses on three threads : the existence of female ejaculation , its source ( s ) and composition , and its relationship to theories of female sexuality for instance , much of the research into the nature of the fluid focuses on determining whether it is or contains urine this latter paper , which traces the history of the controversies to that point , and a series of three papers in 1981 by beverly whipple and colleagues in the journal of sex research , became the focal point of the current debate , female ejaculation and censorship in the uk the board later stated instead that it does not take any view on whether female ejaculation exists and explained that all apparent examples presented to the board were of simple urination masquerading as female ejaculation stated that '' many individuals refer to any fluid expressed from the vagina or urethra during coitus as female ejaculate , which leads to significant confusion in the literature easy on the eye productions released a press announcement on october 6 , 2010 stating that the bbfc passed the dvd women love porn ( containing a scene including female ejaculation in the scene '' top milf '' ) on advice of legal counsel when the director , anna span , pushed for a hearing with the video appeals committee contemporary women 's health literature summarises what is considered factual as being that the amount of fluid varies greatly and may be unnoticeable , occurs with or without vaginal stimulation , and may accompany orgasm or merely intense sexual pleasure , and orgasm may occur without ejaculation nevertheless , the theory advanced by these authors was immediately dismissed by many other authors , such as physiologist joseph bohlen , for not being based on rigorous scientific procedures , and psychiatrist helen singer kaplan ( 1983 ) stated : some radical feminist writers , such as sheila jeffreys ( 1985 ) were also dismissive , claiming it as a figment of male fantasy : jeffreys s a recent study of women who report ejaculation found no evidence of any urological problems , suggesting these two conditions ( ejaculation and coital incontinence ) are quite distinct physiologically , although perhaps not always distinguishable in a particular individual 's mind since the area of interest is para-urethral glands , it is impossible to completely separate the secretions from urine , especially considering that there may be retrograde ejaculation into the urethra towards the bladder he identified xiii:212 the various controversies regarding the ejaculate and its origin , but stated he believed that this fluid '' which rushes out with such impetus during venereal combat or libidinous imagining '' was derived from a number of sources , including the vagina , urinary tract , cervix and uterus in 1982 , bohlen explained the accepted wisdom : scientific studies from the 1980s and later have demonstrated that the substance produced is distinct from urine , though it does show similarities such as alkalinity with urine pap and psa have been identified in the para-urethral tissues , using biochemical and immunohistochemical methods , suggesting that the ejaculate is likely to arise from the ducts in these tissues , in a manner homologous to that in the male research in this area has concentrated almost exclusively on attempts to prove that the ejaculate is not urine , measuring substances such as urea , creatinine , prostatic acid phosphatase ( pap ) , prostate-specific antigen ( psa ) , glucose and fructose levels josephine sevely then followed up her 1978 study by publishing '' eve 's secrets : a new theory of female sexuality '' in 1987 , emphasising an integrated rather than fragmented approach to understanding female sexuality , with the clitoris , vagina and urethra depicted as a single sexual organ although small amounts of prostatic secretions are present in the emitted fluid , the study suggests that squirting is essentially the involuntary emission of urine during sexual activity one very practical objection relates to the reported volumes ejaculated , since this fluid must be stored somewhere in the pelvis , of which the urinary bladder is the largest source further methodological issues include the fact that the composition of the fluid appears to vary with the menstrual cycle , and that the biochemical profile of the para-urethral tissues varies with age in the 17th century , the dutch anatomist reinier de graaf wrote an influential treatise on the reproductive organs concerning the generative organs of women which is much cited in the literature on this topic '' however he appears not to distinguish between the lubrication of the perineum during arousal and an orgasmic ejaculate when he refers to liquid '' which in libidinous women often rushes out at the mere sight of a handsome man these tissues , surrounding the distal urethra , and anterior to the vagina , have a common embryological origin to the prostatic tissue in the male a third concern is that of the increasing 'medicalisation ' of women 's sexuality , as expressed by leonore tiefer which finds its most extreme manifestation in the concept of female sexual dysfunction krafft-ebing 's study of sexual perversion , psychopathia sexualis ( 1886 ) , describes female ejaculation under the heading '' congenital sexual inversion in women '' as a perversion related to neurasthenia and homosexuality advances another feminist theory : that because women 's pleasure in their sexuality has been historically excluded , the pleasure of ejaculation has been either discounted or appropriated by health professionals as a physiological phenomenon female ejaculation appears in 20th-century anthropology works , such as malinowski 's melanesian study , the sexual life of savages ( 1929 ) , and gladwin and sarason 's '' truk : man in paradise '' ( 1956 ) sarah jane hamilton became known as one of the first alleged female ejaculators from britain , though this was later dismissed by porn reviewer pat riley as urination in his review of the british are coming ( 1993 ) as of 2007 , and 2008 the existence of a female prostate and of ejaculation are a matter of debate much of the problem in arriving at a consensus relates to a failure to adopt generally agreed-on definitions or research methodology ultrasounds from a 2014 study , involving seven women who reported recurring massive fluid emission during sexual arousal , confirmed thorough bladder emptiness before stimulation , noticeable bladder filling before squirting and demonstrated that the bladder had again been emptied after squirting the book discussed female ejaculation and brought the issue back into discussions of women 's sexuality both in the medical community and among the general public one source states that skene 's glands are capable of excreting in 30â€“50 seconds , but it is unclear how this was measured and has not been confirmed regardless of the facts relating to the details of female ejaculation , the social significance of the popular accounts through the feminist health care movement has been considerable
