although a molten aluminium salt could be used instead , aluminium oxide has a melting point of 2072 & nbsp ; °c so electrolysing it is impractical in the hall–héroult process , alumina , al 2 o 3 , is dissolved in molten synthetic cryolite , na 3 alf 6 , to lower its melting point for easier electrolysis in the hall–héroult process the following simplified reactions take place at the carbon electrodes : cathode : anode : overall : in reality , much more carbon dioxide is formed at the anode than co : pure cryolite has a melting point of besides having a relatively low melting point , cryolite is used as an electrolyte because , among other things , it also dissolves alumina well , conducts electricity , dissociates electrolytically at higher voltage than alumina , and also has a lower density than aluminum at the temperatures required by the electrolysis in industrial production , alf 3 is added so that the cryolite ratio is 2–3 to further reduce the melting point , so that the electrolysis can happen at temperatures between 940 and 980 & nbsp ; °c the density of the electrolyte should be less than 2.1 & nbsp ; g/ml , so that the molten aluminum separates from the electrolyte and settles properly to the bottom of the electrolysis cell the theoretical minimum energy requirement for this process is 6.23 kwh/ ( kg of al ) , but the process commonly requires 15.37 kwh agitation of the molten material in the cell increases its production rate at the expense of an increase in cryolite impurities in the product in non-agitating static pool cells , the impurities either rise to the top of the metallic aluminium , or sink to the bottom , leaving high-purity aluminium in the middle area the materials most often used in anodes , coke and pitch resin , are mainly residues from the petroleum industry and need to be of high enough purity so no impurities end up into the molten aluminum or the electrolyte the anode is contained within a frame and , as the bottom of the anode turns mainly into co 2 during the electrolysis , the anode loses mass and , being amorphous , it slowly sinks within its frame the lost heat from the smelting operation is used to bake the briquettes into the carbon form required for the reaction with alumina the baking process in söderberg anodes during electrolysis releases more carcinogenic pahs and other pollutants than electrolysis with prebaked anodes and , partially for this reason , prebaked anode-using cells have become more common in the aluminium industry compared to söderberg anodes , computer-controlled prebaked anodes can be brought closer to the molten aluminium layer at the bottom of the cell without any of them touching the layer and interfering with the electrolysis bars of aluminium were exhibited alongside the french crown jewels at the exposition universelle ( 1855 ) , and emperor napoleon iii of france was said to have reserved his few sets of aluminium dinner plates and eating utensils for his most honored guests in 1997 , the hall–héroult process was designated a national historic chemical landmark by the american chemical society in recognition of the importance of the process in the commercialization of aluminium
