the dominant means of long-distance communication in this band is skywave ( '' skip '' ) propagation , in which radio waves directed at an angle into the sky refract back to earth from layers of ionized atoms in the ionosphere by this method hf radio waves can travel beyond the horizon , around the curve of the earth , and can be received at intercontinental distances however , suitability of this portion of the spectrum for such communication varies greatly with a complex combination of factors : sunlight/darkness at site of transmission and reception transmitter/receiver proximity to solar terminator season solar cycle sunspot aurora at any point in time , for a given '' skip '' communication path between two points , the frequencies at which communication is possible are specified by these parameters maximum usable frequency ( muf ) lowest usable high frequency ( luf ) and a frequency of optimum transmission ( fot ) the maximum usable frequency regularly drops below 10 & nbsp ; mhz in darkness during the winter months , while in summer during daylight it can easily surpass 30 & nbsp ; mhz this absorption is stronger at low frequencies and is also stronger with increased solar activity ( for example in daylight ) ; total absorption often occurs at frequencies below 5 & nbsp ; mhz during the daytime the result of these two factors is that the usable spectrum shifts towards the lower frequencies and into the medium frequency ( mf ) range during winter nights , while on a day in full summer the higher frequencies tend to be more usable , often into the lower vhf range when a transcontinental or worldwide path is open on a particular frequency , digital , ssb and morse code communication is possible using surprisingly low transmission powers , often of the order of milliwatts , provided suitable antennas are in use at both ends and that there is little or no man-made or natural interference the main users of the high frequency spectrum are : military and governmental communication systems aviation air-to-ground communications amateur radio shortwave international and regional broadcasting maritime sea-to-shore and ship-to-ship services over-the-horizon radar systems global maritime distress and safety system ( gmdss ) communication citizen 's band radio services worldwide ( generally 26-28 & nbsp ; mhz , the higher portion of the hf band , that behaves more like low-vhf ) the high frequency band is very popular with amateur radio operators , who can take advantage of direct , long-distance ( often inter-continental ) communications and the '' thrill factor '' resulting from making contacts in variable conditions international shortwave broadcasting utilizes this set of frequencies , as well as a seemingly declining number of '' utility '' users ( marine , aviation , military , and diplomatic interests ) , who have , in recent years , been swayed over to less volatile means of communication ( for example , via satellites ) , but may maintain hf stations after switch-over for back-up purposes some modes of communication , such as continuous wave morse code transmissions ( especially by amateur radio operators ) and single sideband voice transmissions are more common in the hf range than on other frequencies , because of their bandwidth-conserving nature , but broadband modes , such as tv transmissions , are generally prohibited by hf 's relatively small chunk of electromagnetic spectrum space the most common antennas in this band are wire antennas such as wire dipoles and the rhombic antenna ; in the upper frequencies , multielement dipole antennas such as the yagi , quad , and log-periodic antennas
