corking allows the mass to engage in a variety of activities , such as forming a cyclone , lifting their bikes in a tradition known as a '' bike lift '' ( in chicago this is referred to as a chicago hold-up ) , or to perform a '' die-in '' where riders lie on the ground with their bikes to symbolise cyclist deaths and injuries caused by automobiles , very popular in montreal for example , many small cities have monthly critical mass rides with fewer than twenty riders which offer safety in numbers to cyclists in those locales , while on the opposite extreme , in what have been the largest events using the name critical mass , cyclists in budapest , hungary hold only two rides each year on april 22 ( earth day ) and september 22 ( car free days ) the practice of corking roads in order to pass through red lights as a group is in contravention of traffic laws in some jurisdictions and is sometimes criticized to be contrary to critical mass ' claim that '' we are traffic '' , since ordinary traffic does not have the right to go through intersections once the traffic signal has changed to red examples of critical mass rides for political movements includes the free tibet rides ( may 2008 ) : free tibet critical mass in columbia , missouri , '' tibetan freedom bike rally '' in san francisco ( aug 2008 ) , and in '' bike ride for tibet '' in london ( aug 2008 ) the term xerocracy was coined to describe a process by which the route for a critical mass can be decided : anyone who has an opinion makes their own map and distributes it to the cyclists participating in the mass joel pomerantz , the writer , rider and co-founder of critical mass who popularized corking in san francisco , explained in his 1992 instructional flyer that he sees the ride as a single vehicle for safety purposes , similar to a longer , articulated bus this term from the footage of the movie , was applied to the name of the ride , and the name caught on , replacing '' commute clot '' by the time of the second event in order for the event to function , the only requirement is a sufficient turn-out to create a '' critical mass '' of riders dense enough to occupy a piece of road to the exclusion of drivers of motorized vehicles shortly after this , some participants in that ride went to a local bicycle shop for a screening of ted white 's documentary return of the scorcher , about bike culture in the netherlands and china in comparison with that of the united states he argued that it enhances both traffic flow overall and safety to keep the ride together as in a funeral procession , which he viewed critical as , metaphorically , for the death of car culture and crash victims the ride consisted of between 70â€“100 cyclists riding through the downtown core , making all attempts to follow the rules of the road ( stopping at red lights / stop signs , using hand signals to turn , using the right-most lane or bike lane when applicable ) right because critical mass takes place without an official route or sanction , participants in some cities have sometimes practiced a tactic known as '' corking '' in order to maintain the cohesion of the group the routes of some rides are decided spontaneously by whomever is currently at the front of the ride , while others are decided prior to the ride by a popular vote of suggested routes often drawn up on photocopied fliers the critical mass rides have inspired a number of other bicycle movements , that range from political movements to the '' critical tits '' ride during the yearly burning man festival critical manners rides through the city on the second friday of the month , with riders encouraged to obey all traffic laws such as stopping at red lights and signaling
