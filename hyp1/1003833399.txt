high strength beryllium copper alloys contain as much as 2.7 % beryllium ( cast ) , or 1.6-2 % beryllium with about 0.3 % cobalt ( wrought ) beryllium copper screwdrivers , pliers , wrench , cold chisels , knives , and hammers are available for environments with explosive hazards , such as oil rigs , coal mines , and grain elevators copper beryllium alloy containing less than 2.5 % beryllium ( in copper ) is not designated as a carcinogen compared to steel tools , beryllium copper tools are more expensive and not as strong , but the properties of beryllium copper in hazardous environments may outweigh the disadvantages thumb beryllium copper is a non-ferrous alloy used in springs , spring wire , load cells , and other parts that must retain their shape under repeated stress and strain beryllium copper is non-sparking but physically tough and nonmagnetic , fulfilling the requirements of atex directive for zones 0 , 1 , and 2 beryllium copper wire is produced in many forms : round , square , flat and shaped , in coils , on spools and in straight lengths it is valued for spring properties , corrosion resistance , stability , conductivity , and low creep high conductivity beryllium copper alloys contain as much as 0.7 % beryllium with some nickel and cobalt it has high electrical conductivity , and is used in low-current contacts for batteries and electrical connectors for a time , beryllium copper was used in the manufacture of golf clubs , particularly wedges and putters c17510 and c17500 beryllium copper alloys are age-hardenable and provide good electrical conductivity , physical properties , and endurance
