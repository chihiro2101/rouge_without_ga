in 1969 , dudley dumonde proposed the term '' lymphokine '' to describe proteins secreted from lymphocytes and later , proteins derived from macrophages and monocytes in culture were called '' monokines '' ( not to be confused with the nobel laureate ) published an article describing the production of mif in virus-infected allantoic membrane and kidney cells , showing its production is not limited to immune cells in contrast , some cytokines ( such as il-6 ) circulate in picomolar ( 10 m ) concentrations that can increase up to 1,000 times during trauma or infection virtually all nucleated cells , but especially endo/epithelial cells and resident macrophages ( many near the interface with the external environment ) are potent producers of il-1 , il-6 , and tnf-α for instance , to accurately utilize hormone terminology , cytokines may be autocrine or paracrine in nature , and chemotaxis , chemokinesis and endocrine as a pyrogen cytokines have been classed as lymphokines , interleukins , and chemokines , based on their presumed function , cell of secretion , or target of action lymphokines : produced by lymphocytes monokines : produced exclusively by monocytes interferons : involved in antiviral responses colony stimulating factors : support the growth of cells in semisolid media chemokines : mediate chemoattraction ( chemotaxis ) between cells structural homogeneity has been able to partially distinguish between cytokines that do not demonstrate a considerable degree of redundancy so that they can be classified into four types : the four-helix bundle family : member cytokines have three-dimensional structures with a bundle of four α-helices a key focus of interest has been that cytokines in one of these two sub-sets tend to inhibit the effects of those in the other the fact that cytokines themselves trigger the release of other cytokines and also lead to increased oxidative stress makes them important in chronic inflammation , as well as other immunoresponses , such as fever and acute phase proteins of the liver ( il-1,6,12 , ifn-a ) in recent years , the cytokine receptors have come to demand the attention of more investigators than cytokines themselves , partly because of their remarkable characteristics and partly because a deficiency of cytokine receptors has now been directly linked to certain debilitating immunodeficiency states in this regard , and also because the redundancy and pleomorphism of cytokines are , in fact , a consequence of their homologous receptors , many authorities think that a classification of cytokine receptors would be more clinically and experimentally useful immunoglobulin superfamily , which are ubiquitously present throughout several cells and tissues of the vertebrate body , and share structural homology with immunoglobulins ( antibody ) , cell adhesion molecules , and even some cytokines tumor necrosis factors ( tnf ) ( type 3 ) family , whose members share a cysteine-rich common extracellular binding domain , and includes several other non-cytokine ligands like cd40 , cd27 and cd30 , besides the ligands on which the family is named this may include the upregulation and/or downregulation of several genes and their transcription factors , resulting in the production of other cytokines , an increase in the number of surface receptors for other molecules , or the suppression of their own effect by enzyme inhibitor the effect of a particular cytokine on a given cell depends on the cytokine , its extracellular abundance , the presence and abundance of the complementary receptor on the cell surface , and downstream signals activated by receptor binding ; these last two factors can vary by cell type the expression of these transcripts indicates that preimplantation embryos may be responsive to lif originating either from the surrounding environment or from the embryos themselves and exerting its function in a paracrine or autocrine manner recombinant cytokines being used as drugs as of 2014 include : bone morphogenetic protein ( bmp ) , used to treat bone-related conditions erythropoietin ( epo ) , used to treat anemia granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( g-csf ) , used to treat neutropenia in cancer patients granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( gm-csf ) , used to treat neutropenia and fungal infections in cancer patients interferon alfa , used to treat hepatitis c and multiple sclerosis interferon beta , used to treat multiple sclerosis interleukin 2 ( il-2 ) , used to treat cancer
