furthermore , under certain experimental conditions , she could detect a variety of visual stimuli , such as the presence and location of objects , as well as shape , pattern , orientation , motion , and color patients with blindsight have damage to the system that produces visual perception ( the visual cortex of the brain and some of the nerve fibers that bring information to it from the eyes ) rather than to the underlying brain system controlling eye movements this ability of those with blindsight to act as if able to see objects that they are unconscious of suggests that consciousness is not a general property of all parts of the brain , but is produced by specialised parts of it this suggests that perceptual awareness is modular and that—in sighted individuals—there is a '' binding process that unifies all information into a whole percept '' , which is interrupted in patients with such conditions as blindsight and visual agnosia research has shown that visual stimuli with the single visual features of sharp borders , sharp onset/offset times , motion , and low spatial frequency contribute to , but are not strictly necessary for , an object 's salience in blindsight a third theory is that the information required to determine the distance to and velocity of an object in object space is determined by the lateral geniculate nucleus before the information is projected to the visual cortex in a normal subject , these signals are used to merge the information from the eyes into a three-dimensional representation ( which includes the position and velocity of individual objects relative to the organism ) , extract a vergence signal to benefit the precision ( previously auxiliary ) optical system , and extract a focus control signal for the lenses of the eyes ( 2004 ) processes in biological vision section 7.4 evidence of blindsight can be indirectly observed in children as young as two months , although there is difficulty in determining the type in a patient who is not old enough to answer questions another 1995 study by the same group sought to prove that monkeys could also be conscious of movement in their deficit visual field despite not being consciously aware of the presence of an object there this showed that the monkey 's ability to detect movement is separate from their ability to consciously detect an object in their deficit visual field , and gave further evidence for the claim that damage to the striate cortex plays a large role in causing the disorder by comparing the test results of both gy and the monkeys , the researchers concluded that similar patterns of responses to stimuli in the '' blind '' visual field can be found in both species this ability to detect stimuli that the observer is not conscious of can extend to discrimination of the type of stimulus ( for example , whether an ' x ' or ' o ' has been presented in the blind field ) a 2011 study found that a young woman with a unilateral lesion of area v1 could scale her grasping movement as she reached out to pick up objects of different sizes placed in her blind field , even though she could not report the sizes of the objects he was able to misstate , as requested , in his left visual field ( with normal conscious vision ) ; but he tended to fail in the task—to state the location correctly—when the stimulus was in his blindsight ( right ) visual field the discovery of the condition known as blindsight raised questions about how different types of visual information , even unconscious information , may be affected and sometimes even unaffected by damage to different areas of the visual cortex previous studies had already demonstrated that even without conscious awareness of visual stimuli humans could still determine certain visual features such as presence in the visual field , shape , orientation and movement but , in a newer study evidence showed that if the damage to the visual cortex occurs in areas above the primary visual cortex the conscious awareness of visual stimuli itself is not damaged blindsight is a phenomenon that shows that even when the primary visual cortex is damaged or removed a person can still perform actions guided by unconscious visual information so even when damage occurs in the area necessary for conscious awareness of visual information , other functions of the processing of these visual percepts are still available to the individual if an area of the cortex that is responsible for a certain function is damaged , it will only result in the loss of that particular function or aspect , functions that other parts of the visual cortex are responsible for remain intact prior studies have already shown that blindsight patients are able to detect motion even though they claim they do not see any visual percepts in their blind fields they would alter the contrast of the brightness of the dots compared to the white background in each different trial to see if the participants performed better or worse when there was a larger discrepancy in brightness or not the participant would press a key to indicate whether the line was horizontal or vertical , and could then also indicate to an observer whether or not he/she actually had a feeling that any object was there or not—even if they could n't see anything the participant was able to accurately determine the orientation of the line when the target was cued by an arrow before the appearance of the target , even though these visual stimuli did not equal awareness in the subject who had no vision in that area of his/her visual field destruction of the primary visual cortex leads to blindness in the part of the visual field that corresponds to the damaged cortical representation the area of blindness – known as a scotoma – is in the visual field opposite the damaged hemisphere and can vary from a small area up to the entire hemifield the route from the retina through v1 is not the only visual pathway into the cortex , though it is by far the largest ; it is commonly thought that the residual performance of people exhibiting blindsight is due to preserved pathways into the extrastriate cortex that bypass v1 this information moves through an area of the brain called the lateral geniculate nucleus , located in the thalamus , and on to be processed in the primary visual cortex , area v1 ( also known as the striate cortex because of its striped appearance ) however , some of these people still experience the blindsight phenomenon , though this too is controversial , with some studies showing a limited amount of consciousness without v1 or projections relating to it mosby 's dictionary of medicine , nursing & health professions defines the lgn as '' one of two elevations of the lateral posterior thalamus receiving visual impulses from the retina via the optic nerves and tracts and relaying the impulses to the calcarine ( visual ) cortex '' visual information then enters the optic tract and travels to four different areas of the brain including the superior colliculus , pretectum of the mid brain , the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus , and the lateral geniculate nucleus ( lgn ) these researchers concluded that the magnocellular system of the lgn is less affected by the removal of v1 , which suggests that it is because of this system in the lgn that blindsight occurs functional magnetic resonance imaging was has also been employed to conduct brain scans in normal , healthy human volunteers to attempt to demonstrate that visual motion can bypass v1 , through a connection from the lgn to the human middle temporal complex
