scientific laboratories can be found as research room and learning spaces in schools and university , industry , government , or military facilities , and even aboard ships and spacecraft a chemist or biology might use a wet laboratory , while a psychology laboratory might be a room with one-way mirrors and hidden cameras in which to observe behavior work is divided , not only between different jobs of the laboratory such as the researchers , engineers and technicians , but also in terms of autonomy ( should the work be individual or in groups ) for the purposes of research , teaching , or analysis ; ( also ) one in which chemicals or drugs are manufactured despite the underlying notion of the lab as a confined space for experts , the term '' laboratory '' is also increasingly applied to workshop spaces such as living lab , fab lab , or hackerspaces , in which people meet to work on societal problems or make prototypes , working collaboratively or sharing resources many schools and businesses employ safety , health , and environmental specialists , such as a chemical hygiene officer ( cho ) to develop , manage , and evaluate their chp in determining the proper chemical hygiene plan for a particular business or laboratory , it is necessary to understand the requirements of the standard , evaluation of the current safety , health and environmental practices and assessment of the hazards under this standard , a laboratory is required to produce a chemical hygiene plan ( chp ) which addresses the specific hazards found in its location , and its approach to them inspections and audits like also be conducted on a regular basis to assess hazards due to chemical handling and storage , electrical equipment , biohazards , hazardous waste management , chemical waste , housekeeping and emergency preparedness , radiation safety , ventilation as well as respiratory testing and indoor air quality '' the sociology of scientific work p98 the coordination mechanisms : which includes the formalization of objectives and tasks ; the standardization of procedures ( protocols , project management , quality management , knowledge management ) , the validation of publications and cross-cutting activities ( number and type of seminars ) additionally , third party review is also used to provide an objective '' outside view '' which provides a fresh look at areas and problems that may be taken for granted or overlooked due to habit the division of labor : '' occurs between designers and operatives ; researchers , engineers , and technicians ; theoreticians and experimenters ; senior researchers , junior researchers and students ; those who publish , those who sign the publications and the others ; and between specialities laboratory techniques are the set of procedures used on natural sciences such as chemistry , biology , physics to conduct an experiment , all of them follow the scientific method ; while some of them involve the use of complex laboratory equipment from laboratory glassware to electrical devices , and others require more specific or expensive supplies in the painting of louis pasteur by albert edelfelt in 1885 , louis pasteur is shown comparing a note in his left hand with a bottle filled with a solid in his right hand , and not wearing any personal protective equipment jahrhunderts , naturhistorisches museum wien.jpg chemistry laboratory of the 18th century , of the sort used by antoine lavoisier and his contemporaries file : edison in his nj laboratory 1901.jpg thomas edison in his laboratory , 1901 file : fotothek df n-09 0000024.jpg a laboratory in the 1970s file : muic chem lab.jpg chemical laboratory in mahidol university international college since 2009 file : muic counter in lab chem.jpg early 2000s style of counter in chemical laboratory , mahidol university international college , thailand file : chemisches labor.jpg laboratory for organic chemistry at the fh aachen , germany the occupational safety and health administration ( osha ) in the united states , recognizing the unique characteristics of the laboratory workplace , has tailored a standard for occupational exposure to hazardous chemicals in laboratories a locator is an employee of a laboratory who is in charge of knowing where each member of the laboratory currently is , based on a unique signal emitted from the badge of each staff member this development is inspired by new , participatory science to science and innovation and relies on user-centred design methods iso 13407 : ( 1999 ) , titled human-centred design processes for interactive systems , is an iso standard providing guidance on human-centred design activities throughout the life cycle of interactive computer-based systems laboratory equipment refers to the various tools and equipment used by scientists working in a laboratory : the classical equipment includes tools such as bunsen burners and microscopes as well as specialty equipment such as operant conditioning chambers , spectrophotometers and calorimeters
