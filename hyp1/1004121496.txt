thumb most modern shopping carts are made of metal or a combination of metal and plastic and have been designed to nest within each other in a line to facilitate collecting and moving many at one time and also to save on storage space most carts in the united states have caster at the front , while the rear wheels are fixed in orientation , while in europe it is more common to have four swivel wheels small shops , where carts would be impractical , often supply only baskets , or may offer a small cart which uses an inserted shopping basket within the frame of the cart to provide either choice to a customer after hiring several male and female models to push his new invention around his store and demonstrate their utility , as well as greeters to explain their use , shopping carts became extremely popular and goldman became a multimillionaire in urban areas like new york city , where transporting groceries home from the store 's parking lot is more likely to involve walking and/or a trip by public transportation than a car ride , privately owned carts resembling goldman 's design are still popular catherine grandclément , '' wheeling one 's groceries around the store : the invention of the shopping cart , 1936-1953 '' , in warren belasco and roger horowitz ( eds goldman continued to make modifications to his original design , but advice from his trusted business partners fred taylor , a grocery store owner , and george o'donnell , a grocery store refrigeration salesman , and the incorporation of watson 's swinging door yielded the familiar nesting cart that we see today ( albeit the original telescope cart had two baskets rather than one ) image : shopping cart shepherd for target jeh.jpg thumb right 200px nested carts being returned from a parking lot to a target store by a cart pushing assist device in 1946 , orla watson devised a system for a telescoping ( i.e , '' nesting '' ) shopping cart which did not require assembly or disassembly of its parts before and after use like goldman 's cart ; goldman 's design up until this point required that the cart be unfolded much like a folding chair watson applied for a patent on his shopping cart invention in 1946 , but goldman contested it and filed an application for a similar patent with the swinging door feature on a shopping cart with only one basket in 1948 which goldman named the '' nest-kart '' the device , called '' project sk8 '' or '' smarter cart '' was basically a cart fitted with windows kinect ( to detect obstacles ) , and an electric drivetrain , and used in conjunction with a windows 8 tablet shopping in the real world : interacting with a context-aware shopping trolley some retailers , such as target , have begun using carts fully made of recycled plastic with the only metal part being the wheel axles , drawing away from the established metal cart design other cart designs also incorporate additional features such as a cup holder for cold or hot drinks or a bouquet of flowers , along with other features such as a secure shelf for a tablet computer or mobile phone to allow the use of mobile coupons and circulars , or as seen in an all-plastic design created for the wisconsin-based festival foods and also used by whole foods market by bemis manufacturing company , all of these features , along with extra rungs on the side rail designed to attach plastic bags or carry handles for beverages in many countries , the customer has to pay a small deposit by inserting a coin , token or card , which is returned if and when the customer returns the cart to a designated cart parking point the system works through a lock mounted on the handle of the cart , connecting it to a chain mounted on the cart in front of it when nested together , or to a chain mounted on a cart collection corral one motivation behind the deposit system is to reduce the expense of employees having to gather carts that are not returned , and to avoid damage done by runaway carts although almost ubiquitous in continental europe and the uk , the deposit system is less common in canada and has not been widely adopted in the united states , with the exception of some chains like aldi , which require a 0.25 deposit one of the first store chains to use the 0.25 deposit system in the us was the real superstore ( a subsidiary of national supermarkets ) in the early 1990s national supermarkets usually , all aldi stores , and most coles and woolworths stores will have a lock mechanism on their carts that requires a 1 or 2 coin to unlock while the deposit systems usually are designed to accommodate a certain size of domestic coin , foreign coins , former currencies ( like german d-marks ) , or even appropriately folded pieces of cardboard can be used to unlock the carts as well cart collectors are also usually provided with a special key that they can use to unlock the carts from the cart bay and get the key back most retailers in north america utilize a cart retrieval service , which collects carts found off the store 's premises and returns them to the store for a fee the primary strength of this system is the ability of pedestrian customers to take purchases home and allow retailers to recapture abandoned carts in a timely manner at a fraction of the cost of a replacement cart a drawback of this method is that it is reactive , instead of proactively preventing the carts from leaving the store premises us patent 5598144a a transmitter with a thin wire is placed around the perimeter of the parking lot , and the boot locks when the cart leaves the designated area there are also safety concerns if the person pushing the trolley is running , and also if the trolley does n't lock and is taken onto a road , locking due to magnetic materials under the road another method is to mount a pole taller than the entrance , onto the shopping cart , so that the pole will block exit of the cart many customers learn to bring their own folding or otherwise collapsible cart with them , which they can usually hang on the store 's cart while shopping all pedestrian exits have specially designed flooring tiles , which , along with specially designed wheels on the cart , will immobilize the cart as they roll onto them many of these names may be used alone or in descriptive phrases such as grocery ____ , shopping ____ , or supermarket _____ : cart , or basket & nbsp ;
