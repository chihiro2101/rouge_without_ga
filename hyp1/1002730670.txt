most people who brux are unaware of the problem , either because there are no symptoms , or because the symptoms are not understood to be associated with a clenching and grinding problem the symptoms of sleep bruxism are usually most intense immediately after waking , and then slowly abate , and the symptoms of a grinding habit which occurs mainly while awake tend to worsen through the day , and may not be present on waking bruxism may cause a variety of signs and symptoms , including : excessive tooth wear , particularly attrition , which flattens the occlusal ( biting ) surface , but also possibly other types of tooth wear such as abfraction , where notches form around the neck of the teeth at the gumline the large forces that can be generated during bruxism can have detrimental effects on the components of masticatory system , namely the teeth , the periodontium and the articulation of the mandible with the skull ( the temporomandibular joints ) , when the canines and incisors of the opposing arches are moved against each other laterally , by the action of the medial pterygoid muscles , this can lead to the wearing down of the incisal edges of the teeth it is thought that the periodontal ligament may respond to increased occlusal ( biting ) forces by resorbing some of the bone of the alveolar crest , which may result in increased tooth mobility , however these changes are reversible if the occlusal force is reduced it is also generally accepted that periodontal disease is a far more common cause of tooth mobility and pathological tooth migration than any influence of bruxism , although bruxism may much less commonly be involved in both the pain may be felt over the angle of the jaw ( masseter ) or in the temple ( temporalis ) , and may be described as a headache or an aching jaw most ( but not all ) bruxism includes clenching force provided by masseter and temporalis muscle groups ; but some bruxers clench and grind front teeth only , which involves minimal action of the masseter and temporalis muscles a tooth may become sore to bite on , and further , tooth wear may reduce the insulating width of enamel and dentin that protects the pulp of the tooth and result in hypersensitivity , e.g a systematic review investigating the possible relationship concluded that when self-reported bruxism is used to diagnose bruxism , there is a positive association with tmd pain , and when stricter diagnostic criteria for bruxism are used , the association with tmd symptoms is much lower the muscles of mastication ( the temporalis , masseter , medial and lateral pterygoid muscles ) are paired on either side and work together to move the mandible , which hinges and slides around its dual articulation with the skull at the temporomandibular joints in individuals without bruxism or other parafunctional activities , during wakefulness the jaw is generally at rest and the teeth are not in contact , except while speaking , swallowing or chewing
