yet , rousseau fails to consider that the state is not a total institution within the liberal democracies , and that the freedom of the citizen in between the elections is the freedom of the citizen to live their life in pursuit of their own happiness , subject to the law made by their elected representatives , who are , in turn , subject to popular pressure , protest , petition , recall , referendum , initiative , and ultimately , electoral defeat if they fail to heed the views of those they represent wolin , too , analyzes the symbiosis of business and public interests that emerged in the cold war to form the tendency of what he calls '' inverted totalitarianism '' : while exploiting the authority and resources of the state , inverted totalitarianism gains its dynamic by combining with other forms of power , such as evangelical religions , and most notably by encouraging a symbiotic relationship between traditional government and the system of '' private '' governance represented by the modern business corporation according to him , u.s state objectives have led to internal conditions that resemble totalitarianism : '' it is a power establishment that over the course of the cold war has spun out of control and now threatens not only the fundamental institutions of democracy , but even of life on the planet through the growing risk of nuclear war by miscalculation '' engdahl , full spectrum dominance , pg also derives from talmon 's introduction to this work : : indeed , from the vantage point of the mid twentieth century the history of the last hundred and fifty years looks like a systematic preparation for the headlong collision between empirical and liberal democracy on the one hand , and totalitarian messianic democracy on the other , in which the world crisis of to-day consists this is in contrast to a totalitarian democracy , with the state as a total institution , where the individual is truly not free without constant participation in their '' democratic '' government ; and thus , the individual in the totalitarian democracy must be '' forced to be free '' if the totalitarian democracy is not to become a totalitarian oligarchy welcome to the desert of the real , london and new york : verso , 2002 here he argues that the war on terror served as a justification for the suspension of civil liberties in the us , while the promise of democracy and freedom was spread abroad as the justification for invading iraq and afghanistan again , however , it is the imperative of achieving the overarching goal of a political nirvana that shapes the vision of the process , and the citizen is expected to contribute to the best of his abilities ; the general is not asked to guide the plow , nor is the farmer asked to lead the troops liberal democracy , on the other hand , posits freedom as something that can and should be achieved by the individual in the short term , even at the expense of things such as material well-being , and sees as an element of this freedom a '' freedom from government '' wherein the individual is able to exercise '' freedom '' in his own terms to the extent that they do not contravene the law in addressing every aspect of the lives of its citizens , the totalitarian democratic state has the power to ensure that all material needs are met from cradle to grave , and all that is required of the citizen is to carry out his role , whatever it may be , to the best of his ability wolin cites phenomena such as the lack of involvement of citizens in a narrow political framework ( due to the influence of money ) , the privatization of social security , and massive increases in military spending and spending on surveillance as examples of the push away from public and towards private-controlled government he argues that while equality-oriented democracy stresses the value of equality over individual freedoms , the reverse is true for freedom-oriented democracy , and in each case , the state will move either to ensure equality by limiting individual freedom , or to ensure individual freedom by giving up equality in full spectrum dominance : totalitarian democracy and the new world order , engdahl focuses on the american drive to achieve global hegemony through military and economic means talmon 's 1952 book the origins of totalitarian democracy discusses the transformation of a state in which traditional values and articles of faith shape the role of government into one in which social utility takes absolute precedence laws passed by the state do not require approval by the citizen on a case-by-case basis , and it can be easily argued that some laws currently in place in some countries purporting to be liberal democracies do not have the approval of the majority of citizens
