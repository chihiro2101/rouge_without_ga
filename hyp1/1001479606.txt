richard 's paradox ( richard 1905 ) concerning certain 'definitions ' of real numbers in the english language is an example of the sort of contradictions that can easily occur if one fails to distinguish between mathematics and metamathematics david hilbert was the first to invoke the term '' metamathematics '' with regularity ( see hilbert 's program ) , in the early 20th century when gauss discovered hyperbolic geometry , it is said that he did not publish anything about it out of fear of the '' uproar of the boeotians '' , which would ruin his status as princeps mathematicorum ( latin , '' the prince of mathematicians '' ) the '' uproar of the boeotians '' came and went , and gave an impetus to metamathematics and great improvements in mathematical rigour , analytical philosophy and logic principia mathematica , or '' pm '' as it is often abbreviated , was an attempt to describe a set of axioms and inference rules in symbolic logic from which all mathematical truths could in principle be proven as such , this ambitious project is of great importance in the history of mathematics and philosophy , being one of the foremost products of the belief that such an undertaking may be achievable however , in 1931 , gödel 's incompleteness theorem proved definitively that pm , and in fact any other attempt , could never achieve this lofty goal ; that is , for any set of axioms and inference rules proposed to encapsulate mathematics , there would in fact be some truths of mathematics which could not be deduced from them hilbert and ackermann the asks for an algorithm that takes as input a statement of a first-order logic ( possibly with a finite number of axioms beyond the usual axioms of first-order logic ) and answers '' yes '' or '' no '' according to whether the statement is universally valid , i.e by gödel 's completeness theorem , a statement is universally valid if and only if it can be deduced from the axioms , so the can also be viewed as asking for an algorithm to decide whether a given statement is provable from the axioms using the rules of logic showing that a general solution to the entscheidungsproblem is impossible , assuming that the intuitive notation of '' effectively calculable '' is captured by the functions computable by a turing machine ( or equivalently , by those expressible in the lambda calculus )
