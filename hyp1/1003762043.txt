the development of standards for digital audio interconnect for both professional and domestic audio equipment , began in the late 1970s in a joint effort between the audio engineering society and the european broadcasting union , and culminated in the publishing of aes3 in 1985 the aes3 standard has been revised in 1992 and 2003 and is published in aes and ebu versions early on , the standard was frequently known as aes/ebu the aes3 standard parallels part 4 of the international standard iec 60958 of the physical interconnection types defined by iec 60958 , two are in common use two subframes ( a and b , normally used for left and right audio channels ) make a frame ) marks a word for channel a ( left ) , other than at the start of an audio block ) marks a word for channel a ( left ) at the start of an audio block the three preambles are called x , y , z in the aes3 standard ; and m , w , b in iec 958 ( an aes extension ) the 8-bit preambles are transmitted in the time allocated to the first four time slots of each subframe ( time slots 0 to 3 ) x or z marks the beginning of a frame , and z marks the beginning of an audio block 0 1 2 3 0 1 2 3 time slots _____ _ _____ _ / \_____/ \_/ \_____/ \_/ \ preamble x _____ _ ___ ___ / \___/ \___/ \_____/ \_/ \ preamble y _____ _ _ _____ / \_/ \_____/ \_____/ \_/ \ preamble z ___ ___ ___ ___ / \___/ \___/ \___/ \___/ \ all 0 bits bmc encoded _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ / \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ \ all 1 bits bmc encoded 0 1 2 3 0 1 2 3 time slots in two-channel aes3 , the preambles form a pattern of zyxyxyxy… , but it is straightforward to extend this structure to additional channels ( more subframes per frame ) , each with a y preamble , as is done in the madi protocol between the aes3 and s/pdif standards , the contents of the 192-bit channel status word differ significantly , although they agree that the first channel status bit distinguishes between the two in the case of aes3 , the standard describes , in detail , the function of each bit these bits are redundant when real-time audio is transmitted ( the receiver can observe the sample rate directly ) , but are useful if aes3 data is recorded or otherwise stored bits 0–3 : indicates the relationship of the two channels ; they might be unrelated audio data , a stereo pair , duplicated mono data , music and voice commentary , a stereo sum/difference code download page for aes standards european broadcasting union , specification of the digital audio interface ( the aes/ebu interface ) tech 3250-e third edition ( 2004 )
