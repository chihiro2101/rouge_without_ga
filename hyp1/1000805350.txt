missionary colonies had by this time been settled in the west indies ( 1732 ) , in greenland ( 1733 ) , among the north american indians ( 1735 ) ; and before zinzendorf 's death the brethren had sent from herrnhut missionary colonies to livonia and the northern shores of the baltic sea , to the slaves of south carolina , to suriname , to the negro slaves in several parts of south america , to tranquebar and the nicobar islands in the east indies , to the copts in egypt , to the inuit of labrador , and to the west coast of south africa a dislike of the dry lutheran orthodoxy of the period gave zinzendorf some sympathy with that side of the growing rationalism which was attacking dogma , while at the same time he felt its lack of earnestness , and of a true and deep understanding of religion and of christianity , and endeavoured to counteract these defects by pointing men to the historical christ , and seeking to recapture practices and spirituality of the apostolic age but in private letters he declared indifference to any confession ; that is , the catholic , reformed and lutheran churches as '' sects '' called , that is an adherence to jesus christ without any doctrine , and finally his own church as the center of this , and including threats to those who would oppose him he had previously , in deference to his family who wished him to become a diplomat , rejected the invitation of august hermann francke to take baron von canstein 's place in the halle orphanage ; and he now resolved to settle down as a landowner , spending his life on behalf of his tenantry three years later , overcome with his labours , he fell ill and died ( on 9 may 1760 ) , leaving bishop johannes von watteville , who had married his eldest daughter benigna zinzendorf , to take his place at the head of the community the '' band of four brothers '' — johann andreas rothe ( pastor at berthelsdorf ) ; melchior schäffer ( pastor at görlitz ) ; friedrich von watteville ( a boyhood friend ) ; and zinzendorf — set to create a revival of religion as well as to preserve the warmth of their own personal trust in christ he met and had profound personal relationships with religious leaders ranging from cardinal louis antoine de noailles , the roman catholic archbishop of paris to john potter , the anglican archbishop of canterbury , both of whom became members of zinzendorf 's order of the grain of mustard seed , pledging to use their positions of power to serve christ in 1722 , zinzendorf offered asylum to a number of persecuted wanderers from moravia and bohemia ( parts of czech republic today ) , and permitted them to build the village of herrnhut on a corner of his estate of berthelsdorf he did not intend to found a religious organization distinct from the area 's lutheran church , but to create a christian association , the members of which by preaching , by distributing tracts and books and by demonstrating practical benevolence might awaken torpid lutheranism his children entered the service of the electors of brandenburg and of saxony , while zinzendorf 's father was in the service of the saxon elector at dresden at the time of his youngest son 's birth as reflected in the communities he established , he believed in christians living lives of love and harmony , and believed that every christian needed to live in a faith community , or gemeinde ( congregation ) in addition to visiting leaders in philadelphia such as benjamin franklin , he met with the leaders of the iroquois and , with the assistance of conrad weiser reached agreements for the free movement of moravian missionaries in the area in 1742 , he advocated respect for the saturday sabbath keeping among the german-speaking christians in philadelphia , citing the use of that day by the ephrata cloister , thus promoting the first practice of the two-day weekend in america some , including village founder christian david , got caught up in apocalyptic fanaticism , referring to zinzendorf as the the beast ( revelation ) , and rothe as the false prophet his school days were spent at franke foundations at halle where pietism was strong , and in 1716 , he went to the university of wittenberg , to study law so as to be ready for a diplomatic career three years later , he traveled in the netherlands , in france , and in various parts of germany , where he made the personal acquaintance of men distinguished for practical goodness and belonging to a variety of churches he wrote a large number of hymns , of which the best-known are '' jesus , thy blood and righteousness '' jesus , thy blood and righteousness ( text ) and jesus , thy blood and righteousness ( mp3 with organ only ) and '' jesus , still lead on '' zinzendorf 's interest in missionary work was sparked by meeting two inuit children converted by hans egede 's mission in greenland and a freed slave , anthony ulrich , who told of terrible oppression among the slaves in the west indies as he began to study the history of the bohemians , he was astonished to find powerful similarities between the theology and practice of the early unitas fratrum and the newly established order of herrnhut this document , and a set of rules laid down by zinzendorf known as the manorial injunctions , were signed by the members of the community on 12 may 1727 he and a number of his followers moved to marienborn ( near büdingen ) and began a period of exile and travel , during which he became known as the '' pilgrim count 149-50 in 1749 , zinzendorf leased lindsey house , a large manor on cheyne walk in chelsea built on the estate of sir thomas more to be a headquarters for work in england his son christian renatus , whom zinzendorf had hoped to make his successor , died in 1752 of tuberculosis christian renatus von zinzendorf 's biography at find a grave and the loss devastated him his mother married again when he was four years old , and he was educated under the charge of his pietistic lutheran grandmother , henriette catharina von gersdorff , who did much to shape his character 262 moravian communities based on this model , such as bethlehem , pennsylvania and old salem , were designed for the sole purpose of serving christ , who also was considered to be the community leader these studies , combined with intense prayer , convinced many of the community that they were called to live together in love , and that the disunity and conflict they had experienced was contrary to the clear calling of scripture other members of the order included christian vi not verified , king of denmark ; general james oglethorpe , governor of georgia ; tomochichi , chief of the creek nation of native american indians ; and erskine , a scottish member of the british parliament personal and religious differences between the estate manager heitz and johann andreas rothe , the lutheran pastor of berthelsdorf , were made more tense by the apocalyptic preaching of johann sigismund krüger most of the initial refugees who came to this asylum were recruited by christian david and came from areas where the early protestant groups such as the unitas fratrum had been dominant prior to the thirty years ' war continued study and prayer in small groups known as banden resulted in a sense of reconciliation in the community , leading to a powerful spiritual renewal on 13 august 1727 during a special communion service at the berthelsdorf church digital : his famous preaching of the redemption through the blood of christ , followed a change of opinion around 1734/35 , the years before it was suspected he had adhered to the opposite doctrines of johann conrad dippel his frequent journeys from home made it almost impossible for him to look after his private affairs ; he was compelled from time to time to raise money by loans , and about 1750 was almost reduced to bankruptcy zinzendorf and the herrnhuters felt a strong identification with the writings of moravian bishop john amos comenius and incorporated many of the ideas of the early unity , his diary ( 1716–1719 ) by gerhard reichel and josef theodor müller ( herrnhut , 1907 ) , and his hymns , etc
