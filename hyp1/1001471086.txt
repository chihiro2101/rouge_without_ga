in the netherlands a fee is charged on blank media which is passed on to '' stichting thuiskopie '' ( foundation homecopy ) , which is in charge of distributing the funds in belgium a fee is charged on both blank media and recording equipment which is passed on to '' auvibel '' , which is in charge of distributing the funds a blank media levy was introduced in canada in 1997 , by the addition of part viii , '' private copying '' , to the canadian copyright act the levy is paid by importers and manufacturers of such media sold within canada ( and typically passed on to the retailer , and passed on to the purchaser ) on february 12 , 2007 , cpcc asked the copyright board of canada to reintroduce the levy of 5 to 75 , this time onto the memory component of the digital audio recorders ( such as mp3 players ) in canada but a price based on units of information ( bits , or megabits ) is not fair either , as for instance a dvd can be used to store a film , a computer game , a large amount of documents , or measurement data the copyright board has handed the task of collecting and distributing the funds to the canadian private copying collective , which is a non-profit private organization they are unfair to consumers in that they are payable regardless of the use to which a levied device ( for example a hard disk ) is put and regardless of whether a user has already paid for the copies they store on a device luxembourg is the only eu member state on the continent without a private copying levy , the other four eu member states lacking a private copying levy are cyprus , ireland , malta and the united kingdom currently there is no proper private copy exception in the united kingdom , there is only a narrow exception regarding broadcast time-shifting ( s70 ( 1 ) of the copyright , designs and patents act 1988 ( cdpa ) ) implemented systems are typically restricted to music and may distribute the proceeds proportionally to a measurement of sales of cds in music shops or amount of air-play on radio or the like it is theorized that such levy may be linked to a corresponding relaxation of copyright law , by permitting the recording of copyrighted works on media for which the tax has been paid contrary fairness arguments although these complexities make the systems of levies are far from perfect they do have some advantages related to fairness in that since there is compensation for private copying whereas in countries where there is no levies , there is a substantial amount of copying taking place without any due compensation being made copyright amendment act 1989 ( cth ) introduced the levy on blank tapes but was later repealed by copyright amendment ( re-enactment ) act 1993 following the '' blank tapes levy case '' in the hca in 1993 the canadian private copying collective has developed a method by which the proceeds are distributed to rights holders based on commercial radio airplay and commercial sales samples , ignoring radio/college airplay and independent record sales not logged by soundscan currently , private copy royalties are generated in the us by the sale of '' blank cds and personal audio devices , media centers , satellite radio devices , and car audio systems that have recording capabilities thanks to a precedent established in a 1998 lawsuit involving the rio pmp300 player , most mp3 players are deemed '' computer peripherals '' and are not subject to a royalty of this type in the u.s the discrepancy between reality and the assumption underlying a levy system is growing as '' web 2.0 '' matures , with pervasive user-supplied content , from wikipedia to youtube some argue that cria wanted to limit the scope of the private copying levy , given that it legalizes copying for the private use of the person making the copy , possibly regardless of whether the source is non-infringing or not the pirate party of canada , or the ppca , has called for the scrapping the levy , as there are plenty of non-piracy related uses for cds and it is unjust to punish canadians who do n't use them for these purposes the private copying levy , less cpcc operating costs , is distributed as per the copyright board 's allocation as : 58.2 % to eligible authors and publishers , 23.8 % to eligible performers and 18.0 % to eligible record companies 102-873 ( i ) , september 17 , 1992 : '' in the case of home taping , the section 1008 exemption protects all noncommercial copying by consumers of digital and analog musical recordings '' this only applies to cds which are labeled and sold for music use ; they do not apply to blank computer cds , even though they can be ( and often are ) used to record or '' burn '' music from the computer to cd in 2005 , the federal court of appeal overruled a 2003 copyright board decision which had applied the blank media levy to mp3 players such as apple inc as a result , copyright holders will have to rely on even more laws to collect levy , and to increase rates of already levied product to recover perceived losses , which run against the political trends toward eliminating levy systems on 2015-07-09 the european parliament approved a non-binding resolution ( reda report ) asking a review of the levy in the european union , building on previous resolutions and studies these royalties are administered by the alliance of artists and recording companies for featured artists and copyright owners , ascap/bmi/sesac for writers , harry fox agency for publishers , and the afm/aftra intellectual property rights distribution fund ( joint venture of afm and aftra ) for non-featured artists
