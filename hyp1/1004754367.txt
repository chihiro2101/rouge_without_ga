members of parliament ( mps ) wishing to give up their seats before the next general election are appointed to an office which causes the mp to be disqualified from membership however , only two are still in use : crown steward and bailiff of the three chiltern hundreds of stoke , desborough and burnham crown steward and bailiff of the manor of northstead the stewardships are unpaid positions that provide no benefits and carry no responsibilities the stewardships have been maintained as nominal offices of profit solely as a legal fiction to meet the requirements of the house of commons disqualification act 1975 when more than two mps resign at a time—for example , when 15 ulster unionist mps resigned in protest at the anglo-irish agreement on 17 december 1985—the resignations are , in theory , not simultaneous but spread throughout the day , enabling each member to hold one of the offices for a short time since anyone receiving a salary from the crown could not be truly independent , the house of commons passed a resolution on 30 december 1680 stating that an mp who '' shall accept any office , or place of profit , from the crown , without the leave of this house however , mps were able to hold crown stewardships until 1740 , when sir watkin williams-wynn became steward of the lordship and manor of bromfield and yale and was deemed to have vacated his commons seat moreover , it quickly became apparent that if ministers of the crown were to be meaningfully responsible to parliament , they needed to be able to sit in the house of commons for this reason , someone appointed to an office of profit was only disqualified from continuing to sit in the house of commons ; it was possible for someone already in office to be ( re- ) elected to parliament without relinquishing the office on 26 january , a treasury spokesperson said '' consistent with long-standing precedent , the chancellor has taken the letter as a request to be appointed the steward and bailiff of the manor of northstead and granted the office '' although david cameron said during prime minister 's questions that adams had '' accepted an office for profit under the crown '' , adams denied this , and continued to simply reject the title , albeit not its effect of removal from office the law relating to resignation is now codified and consolidated in section 4 of the house of commons disqualification act 1975 : schedule 1 lists actual offices that are disqualifying for membership in the house of commons however , the stewardships of the chiltern hundred and the manor of northstead are only included in schedule 1 for the purpose of vacating the seat an mp applies for the office to the chancellor of the exchequer , who usually then signs a warrant appointing the mp to the crown office when an mp is appointed to the post , the treasury releases a public notice : '' the chancellor of the exchequer has this day appointed named individual to be steward and bailiff of the three hundreds of chiltern '' after the speaker has been notified , the appointment and resulting disqualification is noted in the vote and proceedings , the commons ' daily journal of proceedings : notification , laid upon the table by the speaker , that mr chancellor of the exchequer had today appointed named individual , member for named constituency , to the office of steward and bailiff of the three hundreds of chiltern speaker do issue his warrant for the clerk of the crown to make out a new writ for the electing of a member to serve in this present parliament for the county constituency of named area in the room of the right honourable named individual , who since election for the said county constituency has accepted the office of steward or bailiff of her majesty 's three chiltern hundreds of stoke , desborough and burnham in the county of buckingham the escheatorship of munster was first used for parliamentary purposes in the irish parliament from 1793 to 1800 , and in the united parliament ( 24 times for irish seats and once for a scottish seat ) from 1801 to 1820 list of stewards of the chiltern hundreds list of stewards of the manor of east hendred list of stewards of the manor of hempholme list of stewards of the manor of northstead list of stewards of the manor of old shoreham list of stewards of the manor of poynings list of escheators of connaught and list of escheators of leinster ( used for resignation from the irish house of commons ) resignation from the house of lords
