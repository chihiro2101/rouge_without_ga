in 2005 cisco introduced the cisco ios xr network operating system on the cisco 12000 of network routers , extending the microkernel architecture from the crs-1 routers to cisco 's widely deployed core routers the company acquired a number of young companies that focused on network switches , such as the inventor of the first ethernet switch kalpana , and as a result cisco switches did not run the ios the ios xr development train used the real-time operating system microkernel ( qnx ) , so a large part of the ios source code was re-written to take advantage of the features offered by the kernel for example , cisco ios releases meant for use on catalyst switches are available as '' standard '' versions ( providing only basic ip routing ) , '' enhanced '' versions , which provide full ipv4 routing support , and '' advanced ip services '' versions , which provide the enhanced features as well as ipv6 support to simplify the process of enlarging the feature-set and reduce the need for network operating system reloads , cisco introduced universal ios images , that include all features available for a device and customers may unlock certain features by purchasing an additional software license in routers with hardware-based forwarding , such as the cisco 12000 series , ios computes the fib in software and loads it into the forwarding hardware ( such as an asic or network processor ) , which performs the actual packet forwarding function for the nexus switches cisco developed nx-os , which is similar to ios , except that it is linux-based routing and other protocols run as cisco ios processes and contribute to the routing information base ( rib ) most cisco products that run ios also have one or more '' feature sets '' or '' packages '' , typically eight packages for cisco routers and five packages for cisco network switches for cisco products that required very high availability , such as the cisco crs-1 , the limitations of a monolithic kernel were not acceptable the disadvantage of the ios architecture is that it increases the complexity of the operating system , data corruption is possible as one process can write over the data of another , and one process can destabilize the entire operating system or even cause a software-forced crash an interface descriptor block , or simply idb , is a portion of memory or cisco ios internal data structure that contains information such as the ip address , interface state , and packet statistics for networking data in addition , competitive router operating systems that emerged 10â€“20 years after ios , such as juniper 's junos , were designed not to have these limitations in all versions of cisco ios , routing and forwarding ( switching ) are distinct functions juniper networks : junos cisco 's response was to develop a tree of the cisco ios that offered modularity and memory protection between processes , lightweight threads , preemption ( computing ) and the ability to independently restart failed processes e ( zero , one or two letters ) is the software release train identifier , such as none ( which designates the mainline , see below ) , t ( for technology ) , e ( for enterprise ) , s ( for service provider ) , xa as a special functionality train , xb as a different special functionality train , etc cisco ios is versioned using three numbers and some letters , in the general form a.b ( c.d ) e , where : a is the major version number cisco says , '' a train is a vehicle for delivering cisco software to a specific set of platforms and features there is no memory protection between processes and ios has a run to completion scheduler , which means that the kernel does not pre-empt a running process each ios image therefore include a feature set , which determine the command-line interface ( cli ) commands and features that are available on different cisco devices this is processed to generate the final ip forwarding table ( fib , forwarding information base ) , which is used by the forwarding function of the router
