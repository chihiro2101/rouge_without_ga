meteorites and micrometeorites ( as they are known upon arrival at the earth 's surface ) can only be collected in areas where there is no terrestrial sedimentation , typically polar regions fred whipple , '' the theory of micro-meteorites , part i : in an isothermal atmosphere '' , proceedings of the national academy of sciences , volume 36 number 12 ( 15 december 1950 ) , pp fred whipple was intrigued by this and wrote a paper that demonstrated that particles of this size were too small to maintain their velocity when they encountered the upper atmosphere in order to classify these sorts of objects , he coined the term '' micrometeorite '' whipple , in collaboration with fletcher watson of the harvard observatory , led an effort to build an observatory to directly measure the velocity of the meteors that could be seen direct measurements at the new observatory were used to locate the source of the meteors , demonstrating that the bulk of material was left over from comet tails , and that none of it could be shown to have an extra-solar origin in 1957 , hans pettersson conducted one of the first direct measurements of the fall of space dust on the earth , estimating it to be 14,300,000 tons per year this suggested that the meteoroid flux in space was much higher than the number based on telescope observations these showed that the rate of meteors passing into the atmosphere , or flux , was in line with the optical measurements , at around 10,000 to 20,000 tons per year while the tiny sizes of most micrometeoroids limits the damage incurred , the high velocity impacts will constantly degrade the outer casing of spacecraft in a manner analogous to sandblasting ) the risk is especially high for objects in space for long periods of time , such as satellites his studies had demonstrated that the chance of being hit by a meteoroid large enough to destroy a spacecraft was extremely remote originally known as a '' meteor bumper '' and now termed the whipple shield , this consists of a thin foil film held a short distance away from the spacecraft 's body by the time this plasma crosses the gap between the shield and the spacecraft , it is so diffused that it is unable to penetrate the structural material below
