evidence about the composition of the first volume of waverley is inconclusive , but it was probably begun in 1808 and laid aside , continued in 1810 and again laid aside , and eventually taken up and completed in the later part of 1813 among the most consistently helpful books were : john home , the history of the rebellion in the year 1745 ( 1802 ) edmund burt , letters from a gentleman in the north of scotland ( 1754 ) donald macintosh , a collection of gaelic proverbs , and familiar phrases ( 1785 ) the first edition was followed by two further editions , together comprising 4000 copies , in the same year , with small authorial revisions , and by several more editions extending into the early 1820s : scott was involved in at least one of these , the sixth edition of 1816 in early 1826 scott returned to waverley , revising the text and writing an introduction and notes for a complete edition of the waverley novels : this took some time to materialise after the 1826 financial crash , but eventually the novel appeared as the first and second volumes of the 'magnum ' edition in june and july 1829 garside in 2007 , as the first volume of the edinburgh edition of the waverley novels : this is based on the first edition with emendations to restore authorial readings from the manuscript and the second and third editions it is the time of the jacobite rising of 1745 which sought to restore the stuart dynasty in the person of charles edward stuart , known as '' bonnie prince charlie '' he journeys north from his aristocratic family home , waverley-honour , in the south of england , first to the scottish lowlands and the home of family friend baron bradwardine , then into the highlands and the heart of the rebellion and its aftermath edward is at ease in the family estate owned by his uncle , sir everard waverley , who maintains the family 's traditional tory and jacobite sympathies when wild highlanders visit bradwardine 's castle , edward is intrigued and goes to the mountain lair of the clan mac-ivor , meeting the chieftain fergus and his sister flora , who turn out to be active jacobites preparing for the insurrection the highlanders rescue him from his escort and take him to the jacobite stronghold at doune castle , then on to holyrood palace , where he meets bonnie prince charlie , with whom he is charmed undaunted by the light , inaccurate guns , the highlander army continues its charge ;

he shoots in self-defence , wounding the smith 8 ( 31 ) an examination : edward is examined by the justice of the peace major mellville , with mr morton the minister ; the case against him mounts up , including evidence that by means of an agent he had tempted his compatriot sergeant houghton to desert to the jacobite cause 9 ( 32 ) a conference , and the consequences : morton and mellville discuss edward 's case , and the colonel decides to ask the cameronian gilfillan to escort him to stirling 20 ( 43 ) the ball : on the eve of battle edward is encouraged by charles in his pursuit of flora and impresses her with his spirited conduct at the ball 8 ( 55 ) a brave man in sorrow : edward learns from talbot that his wife , distressed by the news from scotland , has lost her baby and is seriously ill 14 ( 61 ) a journey to london : learning from a newspaper of his father 's death and of sir everard 's impending trial for high treason in his nephew 's absence , edward makes his way to london ;

second , that scott , or his narrators , allow the female characters thoughts , feelings and passions which are often ignored or unacknowledged by the heroes , such as waverley the opening five chapters of waverley are often thought to be dour and uninteresting , an impression in part due to scott 's own comments on them at the end of chapter five the comments on the relay of information via dyers weekly letter , the self-explanatory name of the lawyer , clippurse , sir everard 's desire and courting of the youngest sister , lady emily , all point in this direction , every one that was in distress , and every one that was in debt , and every one that was discontented , which the vulgate renders bitter of soul ; and doubtless '' he said '' they will prove mighty men of their hands , and there is much need that they should , for i have seen many a sour look cast upon us fear of civil war is ever-present in waverley not just as subject matter or historical reality , but a primal fear as deep in scott as in shakespeare as manifested by various allusions throughout the novel and by direct references to henry v and henry vi in chapter 71 as scott describes him , edward waverley is like don quixote in his manner of educating himself by much reading , but as '' an unstructured education '' , and as scott says in the novel '' consisting of much curious , though ill-arranged and miscellaneous information scott further clarifies the degree of this similarity to quixote in the novel , in his instructions to his readers that : from the minuteness with which i have traced waverley 's pursuits , and the bias which they unavoidably communicated to his imagination , the reader may perhaps anticipate , in the following tale , an imitation of cervantes my intention is not to follow the steps of that inimitable author , in describing such total perversion of intellect as misconstrues the objects actually presented to the senses , but that more common aberration from sound judgment , which apprehends occurrences indeed in their reality , but communicates to them a tincture of its own romantic tone and colouring the anti-jacobin review and the critical review considered the work too scottish , and the latter ( assuming scott 's authorship ) thought it odd for an established poet to become a 'scribbler ' while the new annual register found it less interesting than might have been expected from his hand in the quarterly review john wilson croker , writing anonymously like all the reviewers , compared it to dutch paintings , congenial rather than exalted , and advised the author to stick to history , while the scourge considered that scott did not take readers beyond their usual susceptibilities in eckermann 's conversations with goethe , goethe lauded waverley as '' the best novel by sir walter scott , '' and he asserted that scott '' has never written anything to surpass , or even equal , that first published novel '' he regarded scott as a genius and as one of the greatest writers of english of his time , along with lord byron and thomas moore discussing scott 's talent as a writer , goethe stated , '' you will find everywhere in walter scott a remarkable security and thoroughness in his delineation , which proceeds from his comprehensive knowledge of the real world , obtained by lifelong studies and observations , and a daily discussion of the most important relations '' in 1815 , scott was given the honour of dining with george , prince regent , who wanted to meet '' the author of waverley '' it is thought that at this meeting scott persuaded george that as a stuart prince he could claim to be a jacobite highland chieftain , a claim that would be dramatised when george became king and visited scotland london : edward arnold his critique has received fierce opposition from scott scholars , who believe his attack is a symptom of his ignorance , perhaps of literature , but more certainly of all things scottish this hostility reaches academic circles , as is made evident by allan massie 's lecture the appeal of scott to the practising novel , the inaugural lecture at the 1991 scott conference this is clear from the distinction he draws between the eighteenth-century novel of manners , where social realities are described with little attention to diachronic change , and the eruption of history in the lives of communities , as occurs in historical novels furthermore , that waverley marks an important watershed is firmly stated in lukács ' opening sentence , that '' the historical novel arose at the beginning of the nineteenth century at about the time of napoleon 's collapse a succession of paddle steamers have been named after the novel , culminating in the present ps waverley waverly place in greenwich village , new york city , was named for the novel in 1833 , a year after scott 's death , though the name was misspelled the proposition '' scott is the author of waverley '' is one of the examples whose meaning bertrand russell studied in his paper '' on denoting '' s : on denoting the character of davie gellatley , who is described as '' an innocent '' or a '' fool '' , is thought to be based on jamie fleeman , the laird of udny 's fool
