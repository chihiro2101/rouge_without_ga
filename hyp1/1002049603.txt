in 1926 , as part of his preparation for that year 's performance with the concertgebouw orchestra , stravinsky rewrote the '' evocation of the ancestors '' section and made substantial changes to the '' sacrificial dance '' 137 aaron copland , to whom stravinsky was a particular inspiration in the former 's student days , considered the rite a masterpiece that had created '' the decade of the displaced accent and the polytonal chord '' varèse , according to ross , was particularly drawn to the '' cruel harmonies and stimulating rhythms '' of the rite , which he employed to full effect in his concert work amériques ( 1921 ) , scored for a massive orchestra with added sound effects including a lion 's roar and a wailing siren 118–19 according to the critic edward greenfield , stravinsky was not technically a great conductor but , greenfield says , in the 1960 recording with the columbia symphony orchestra the composer inspired a performance with '' extraordinary thrust and resilience '' 258 ross has described the rite as a prophetic work , presaging the '' second avant-garde '' era in classical composition—music of the body rather than of the mind , in which '' melodies would follow the patterns of speech ; rhythms would match the energy of dance & nbsp ; the composer had left galaxy music corporation ( agents for editions russe de la musique , the original publisher ) for associated music publishers at the time , and orchestras would be reluctant to pay a second rental charge from two publishers to match the full work and the revised sacrificial dance ; moreover , the revised dance could only be published in america in 1948 boosey & hawkes issued a corrected version of the 1929 score ( b & h 16333 ) , although stravinsky 's substantial 1943 amendment of the '' sacrificial dance '' was not incorporated into the new version and remained unperformed , to the composer 's disappointment in later life stravinsky claimed distaste for the adaptation , though as ross remarks , he said nothing critical at the time ; according to ross , the composer paul hindemith observed that '' igor appears to love it '' after the revival of the work in 1920 stravinsky , who had not heard the music for seven years , made numerous revisions to the score , which was finally published in 1921 ( edition russe de musique , rv 197/197b before the first gramophone disc recordings of the rite were issued in 1929 , stravinsky had helped to produce a pianola version of the work for the london branch of the aeolian company taruskin writes that '' one of the marks of the rite 's unique status is the number of books that have been devoted to it—certainly a greater number than have been devoted to any other ballet , possibly to any other individual musical composition & nbsp ; the rite segment of the film depicted the earth 's prehistory , with the creation of life , leading to the extinction of the dinosaurs as the finale the paul sacher foundation , in association with boosey & hawkes , announced in may 2013 , as part of the rites centenary celebrations , their intention to publish the 1913 autograph score , as used in early performances he praised a 1962 recording by the moscow state symphony orchestra for making the music sound russian , '' which is just right '' , but stravinsky 's concluding judgement was that none of these three performances was worth preserving
