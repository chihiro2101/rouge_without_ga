andronicus is the latinization of a greek name , which was held by a number of greek historical figures of the period it is generally considered that andronicus came from his greek name and that livius , a name originally local to latium , was the gentilicium , the family name , of his patron ( patronus ) his career at rome was launched from servitude and he became a freedman ( libertus ) by the grace of his master , one of the livia gens cicero goes on to relate the point of view of accius , that livius was captured from taranto in 209 , and produced a play in 197 cicero disagrees with this view on the grounds that it would make livius younger than plautus and naevius , though he was supposed to have been the first to produce a play his entry for the year of abraham 1829 , the second year of the 148th olympiad ( 186/185 bc ) , of his chronicon , reads titus livius tragoediarum scriptor clarus habetur , qui ob ingenii meritum a livio salinatore , cuius liberos erudiebat , libertate donatus est if jerome means that the liberation took place in 186 , then he seems to be following accius ' view , which might have been presented in the missing portions of suetonius ' de poetis and read by jerome however , the mixed name of livius and his being associated with salinator suggests that he was captured at the first fall of tarentum in 272 , sold to the first marcus livius salinator , tutored the second and was set free to have an independent career when the task was complete this project was one of the first examples of translation as an artistic process ; the work was to be enjoyed on its own , and livius strove to preserve the artistic quality of the original in the fragments we have , it is clear that livius had a desire to remain faithful to the original and to be clear , while having to alter untranslatable phrases and ideas for example , the phrase '' equal to the gods '' , which would have been unacceptable to romans , was changed to '' summus adprimus '' , '' greatest and of first rank '' in general , livius did not make arbitrary changes to the text ; rather , he attempted to remain faithful to homer and to the latin language one story says that after straining his voice , livius , who was also an actor , was the first to leave the singing to singers and limited the actors to dialogue these dramatic works of livius andronicus were consistent with greek requirements of drama and probably had greek models , and we have no more than 60 fragments , as quoted in other authors the titles of his known tragedy are achilles , aegisthus , aiax mastigophorus ( ajax with the whip ) , andromeda , antiopa , danae , equus troianus , hermiona , and tereus the romans called this sort of adaptation of comedy by livius and his immediate successors fabula palliata , or comoedia palliata , named from the pallium , or short cloak , worn by the actors because of the success of this hymn , livius received public honours when his professional organization , the collegium scribarum histrionumque was installed in the temple of minerva on the aventine
