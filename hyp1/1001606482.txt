a few days before the election , on 27 april 1292 , the first of the electors , archbishop siegfried issued the treaty of andernach , stating that for adolf to be chosen king he must promise a long list of acknowledgments of possession ( including the imperial cities of dortmund and duisburg , and the vogtship of essen ) , pledges of imperial cities and castles , and a sum of 25,000 marks in silver because adolf had been elected and crowned , the contemporary understanding was that he had been chosen by god to be the ruler and that the princes were breaking their oath in which they swore loyalty to the king in february 1298 , the situation became alarming for adolf because wenceslaus ii and albert of habsburg put aside their years of disputes over austria and styria , and reached an agreement in the event that adolf was deposed and albert elected in his place the disposition of the prestigious insignia and relics of the empire was an additional and important sign for the legitimacy of the reign of the king , but not a mandatory prerequisite a meeting between the archbishop of mainz , count albrecht of saxony-wittenberg , and three margraves of brandenburg ( otto iv , margrave of brandenburg-stendal , henry i , margrave of brandenburg and herman , margrave of brandenburg-salzwedel ) on 23 june 1298 then led to a lawsuit against the king himself king rudolf awarded him with the burghauptmannamt ( castle lordship ) of kalsmunt castle in wetzlar and a year later that of burg gutenfels near kaub ( where he became a vassal of the electorate of the palatinate ) on 5 may 1292 in frankfurt am main , the archbishop of mainz , in the name of all the electors , elected adolf king of the germans ( emperor-elect ) in exchange for his surrender of the imperial regalia , which he still had in his possession , he received , in november 1292 , a formal enfeoffment with austria , styria , the windic march , and the lordship of pordenone furthermore , he seized the margraviate of meissen as an imperial fief , since it had been literally ownerless after the extinction of a collateral line of the house of wettin and had been occupied by a son of albert the degenerate the last clause is evidence of the fact that at the end of the 13th century , the coronation of the king as the constitutive moment of his rule was still very critical in these proceedings adolf was charged with numerous crimes , including the continued breach of the peace in thuringia and the breaking of the promises he had made to the archbishop of mainz in january 1298 , through the efforts of the archbishop of mainz , albert of habsburg was brought to testify before an imperial court in order to find a compromise between adolf and albert two years later , in the summer of 1296 , adolf proudly announced on the invitation to a court day that he had by his actions significantly increased the possessions of the empire first , adolf succeeded in securing his acquisitions diplomatically and provoking the margrave of brandenburg toward active support and the archbishop of mainz and the duke of saxony toward at least acquiescence of the purchase after his election , king adolf of nassau would only rarely be in his home country , having transferred the government there to his burgmen he took the side of the nobles in the core habsburg areas of swabia and in their newly acquired territories in austria , with whom albert was unpopular he was thwarted , however , by the opposition of the archbishop of cologne , siegfried ii of westerburg , and the king of bohemia , wenceslaus ii of bohemia agnes of isenburg-limburg , the sister of imagina , was married to henry ( heinrich ) of westerburg , the brother of siegfried ii of westerburg , the archbishop of cologne wenceslaus ii of bohemia was not thrilled by the growing power of the emperor on his northern border , especially since adolf had promised to give him the margraviate of meissen he was born about 1255 and was the son of walram ii , count of nassau and adelheid of katzenelnbogen albert did not allow the followers of adolf to bury the body of the fallen king in the kaiserdom , the speyer cathedral in addition to the ostensible return of imperial fiefs to the empire , it can not be ruled out that adolf was anxious to build a dynastic power base ( albeit a small one ) pope boniface viii , however , ordered peace in 1295 and threatened to commence the excommunication of adolf in the event of an outbreak of war although the duchy of nassau was annexed by prussia in 1866 , duke adolf maintained and renewed the order when he became grand duke of luxembourg on 2 july 1298 the armies of adolf and albert met at the battle of göllheim however , the king , as a party to the conflict , could not at the same time act as judge and saw these charges as a provocation given that albert was raising arms against him , the rightful king in comparison to the benefits which the electors of mainz , cologne and bohemian received , the donations to the count palatine and the archbishop of trier were modest the archbishop awaited from the king a revision of the results of the battle of worringen in 1288 wenceslaus succeeded in bringing the electors of brandenburg and saxony over to his side : albert ii of saxony signed an elector pact on 29 november 1291 that he would vote the same as wenceslaus ; otto iv of brandenburg made a similar commitment after the election , adolf had to give the archbishop sufficient collateral for the fulfilment of the promise ; otherwise he would lose his throne around 1280 , adolf became involved in the with the lords of eppstein , in which the city of wiesbaden was devastated and sonnenberg castle destroyed gerhard , the archbishop of mainz would receive the imperial cities of mühlhausen and nordhausen , which corresponded with the interests of mainz in the thuringian region on 31 august 1294 , he sent a declaration of war to the french king , alleging that the latter had seized rights and possessions of the empire
