it may result in a reduction of the amount of fumarate available to the citric acid cycle , and it may result in lower levels of nitric oxide ( a vasodilator ) in the body , reducing blood flow and oxygen intake during vigorous exercise , though this may be offset by increased levels of adenosine , another vasodilator this happens because l-lactate and d-lactate compete with each other for renal re-absorption , and because d-lactate has a significantly lower renal re-absorption threshold , which allows the citric acid cycle to be sped up by some other mechanism ( perhaps by the allosteric mechanism that reacts to the lower concentration of atp , or by amplification of the residual ampd activity by the bloated amp pool ) , until atp production is balanced with atp consumption amp deaminase is an enzyme that converts adenosine monophosphate ( amp ) to inosine monophosphate ( imp ) , freeing an ammonia molecule in the process adenosine production and lack of ammonia overproduction seem to strongly suppress rhabdomyolysis down to the purine nucleotide energy charge level , where the cell is able to signal pain , or where individual muscle fibers start cramping ( fail to relax from contraction in sync with the rest of the muscle ) , or the whole muscle fails to contract ( when walking quickly downhill ) , allowing the person to appropriately modulate the exertion it may be especially important to have adequate dietary iodine in the glycogen-less state , so that stomach emptying is not excessively delayed , the up-regulation of the citric acid cycle in muscle cells in response to a load increment is not too slow , and the muscles can each time accept a bigger load increment relative to the perceived effort it was demonstrated , that muscle cells , that lack ampd1 , stock and consume significantly more glutamate , and produce more alanine in this state , compared to healthy controls , which indicates occurrence of a higher concentration of pyruvate in the cell during exercise if a food containing even small but perceivable amount of sugar ( simple sugars or disaccharides that can be tasted sweet , or starch that is at least minimally hydrolyzed by salivary amylase , or even some non-sugar sweeteners ) is eaten in this state , there may be a period of time after it enters stomach and before bulk absorption occurs , when continuous exercise becomes very hard , and easily triggers rhabdomyolysis by sitting down , walking , or cycling ) , the ammonia , produced by the amplified residual ampd activity , may accumulate in the muscle cells and in the surrounding tissues to toxic levels , and may also indirectly affect other organs although probably unrelated to ampd deficiency , if the person happens to have a high load of d-lactate in the blood ( mostly from food and colonic fermentation ) , the precipitate , the lactate loss and the magnesium loss may occur even before l-lactate ( mostly from muscles ) reaches its renal re-absorption threshold though the body can manufacture some ribose and obtain more from rna-rich sources such as beans and red meat , this loss of ribose due to madd is sometimes sufficient to create a shortage in the body , resulting in symptoms of severe fatigue and muscle pain ; muscle cramping the cause of cramping is unknown , but may be related to elevated lactate , increased calcium signaling across the sarcoplasmic reticulum caused by membrane instability from reduced levels of atp , or increased levels of free adenosine in mcardle 's , the highly active amp deaminase , which additionally experiences amplification from the bloated amp pool due to the lack of the moderating effect of myophosphorylase , is able to produce a readily observable '' second wind '' phenomenon almost exactly 7 minutes after a significant load increment amp conversion to adenosine , excretion to the blood ( as amp and its various metabolites ) , further conversion to uric acid and excretion to urine becomes significant for some time , until all amp is eliminated from the muscle cell thus , it may take the residual ampd activity less time to build up citric acid cycle intermediates , when the whole body is warmed up for an exercise at the same time , rather than a specific group of muscles needed in the exercise if a large group of muscles is still actively drawing fuels from blood after the most recent continuous exercise , in order to replenish the atp and the phosphocreatine reserve , it may become sour without any additional exercise by the time the carbohydrate meal is finished instead of being converted to imp , the amp builds up in the cells of affected individuals , spills into the blood , and is eventually metabolized in the liver if the carbohydrate meal consists of a food ( which does n't need to be carbohydrate itself ) , that requires prolonged vigorous chewing , and then some time to be digested , for instance parboiled long grain rice , chewing may suddenly become very slow and difficult halfway through the meal symptomatic relief from the effects of madd may sometimes be achieved by administering ribose orally at a dose of approximately 10 & nbsp ; grams per 100 pounds ( 0.2 g/kg ) of body weight per day , and exercise modulation as appropriate notably , a small quantity of dietary fructose does not produce this effect ( the lactic acidosis ) , as it is captured by liver and may be fully expended for replenishing liver glycogen in case of leg muscles , where circulation is substantially dependent on their cyclical contraction when the body is upright , a small but useful degree of initial up-regulation of the citric acid cycle may be achieved just by standing still for a few minutes creatine monohydrate could also be helpful for ampd patients , as it provides an alternative source of energy for anaerobic muscle tissue and was found to be helpful in the treatment of other , unrelated muscular myopathies this would decrease the excess rate of pyruvate production by increasing its consumption , increase the rate of amp recharge to atp by the citric acid cycle , and consequently reduce liberation of glucose from glycogen , until increased supply of blood-borne fuels allows to shut down glycogenolysis completely in persons with a defective enzyme , 5'-nucleotidase removes the ribose and phosphorus from amp , increasing levels of adenosine measured in muscle cells by ~16–25× , after exercise because magnesium is essential to aerobic metabolism , over time , magnesium loss may lead to a vicious cycle , where the citric acid cycle is further down-regulated , lactate production is increased , and magnesium loss is increased again this rhabdomyolysis is probably not of exertional , but of hypoglycemic nature , as loaded glycogen-less muscles can rapidly remove glucose from blood , and the normal mechanism of glucose homeostasis lacks the required responsiveness or capacity to prevent hypoglycemia
