currently , despite the fact that web-browsers have become ubiquitous and are typically the client for end-users in many application deployment strategies , browser-based web apps represent only a subset of application-server technologies application servers consist of web server connectors , computer programming languages , runtime library , database connectors , and the administration code needed to deploy , configure , manage , and connect these components on a web host web applications are computer code which run atop application servers and are written in the language ( s ) the application server supports and call the runtime libraries and components the application server offers java platform , enterprise edition or java ee ( was j2ee ) defines the core set of api and features of java application servers according to the java blueprints , the business logic of an application resides in enterprise javabeans—a modular server component providing many features , including declarative transaction management , and improving application scalability technet : application server the windows application server role includes internet information services ( iis ) to provide web server support , the net framework to provide application support , asp.net to provide server side scripting , com+ for application component communication , message queuing for multithreaded processing , and the windows communication foundation ( wcf ) for application communication much like a web server that stores , processes , and delivers web pages to clients , a mobile app server bridges the gap from existing infrastructure to mobile devices although most standards-based infrastructure ( including soas ) are designed to connect to any independent of any vendor , product or technology , most enterprises have trouble connecting back-end systems to mobile applications , because mobile devices add the following technological challenges : limited resources – mobile devices have limited power and bandwidth intermittent connectivity – cellular service and wifi coverage is often not continuous difficult to secure – mobility and byod make it hard to secure mobile devices the purpose of a mobile application server is to build on existing infrastructure to accommodate mobile devices core capabilities of mobile application services include data routing– data is packaged in smaller ( rest ) objects with some business logic to minimize demands on bandwidth and battery orchestration– transactions and data integration across multiple sources authentication service– secure connectivity to back-end systems is managed by the mobile middleware off-line support– allows users to access and use data even though the device is not connected security– data encryption , device control , ssl , call logging mobile application servers , application servers , and web servers serve similar purposes : they are pieces of middleware that connect back-end systems to the users that need to access them , but the technology in each of the three differs
