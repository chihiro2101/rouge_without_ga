in the 1861 edition of the french encyclopedia , the nouvelle biographie universelle , it even lists molay as a mongol commander in its '' molay '' article : modern historians , however , state that the truth of the matter is this : there are indeed numerous ancient records of mongol raids and occupations of jerusalem ( from western , armenian , or arab sources ) , and in 1300 the mongols did achieve a brief victory in syria which caused a muslim retreat , and allowed the mongols to launch raids into the levant as far as gaza for a period of a few months the american historian henry charles lea wrote : '' even in distant germany philippe 's death was spoken of as a retribution for his destruction of the templars , and clement was described as shedding tears of remorse on his death-bed for three great crimes , the poisoning of henry vii , holy roman emperor , and the ruin of the templars and beguines '' the second of the two degrees , known as '' the demolay degree , '' which , along with the initiatory degree , members and observers are sworn to keep secret , dramatically recreates the trial , '' before a commission in its council chamber , '' of the historic characters named in the ritual as '' jacques demolay and his three preceptors , geoffroi de charney , godfrey de goneville , and hughes de peralde as described by modern historian malcolm barber in the new knighthood : '' it was during the 1760s that german masons introduced a specific templar connection , claiming that the order , through its occupation of the temple of solomon , had been the repository of secret wisdom and magical powers , which james of molay had handed down to his successor before his execution and of which the eighteenth-century freemasons were the direct heirs little is known of his early years , but jacques de molay was probably born in molay , haute-saône , in the county of burgundy , at the time a territory ruled by otto iii as part of the holy roman empire , and in modern times in the area of franche-comté , northeastern france '' the drama concludes with the commission condemning the four to life imprisonment ; however , according to the ritual , '' so incensed was the king at the noble defiance and defense of demolay and geoffroi de charney that he overrode the commission ’ s verdict and hurried demolay and de charney to the stake on an island near the cathedral , where they were barbarously burned on 6 june , the leaders of both the templars and the hospitallers were officially asked to come to the papal offices in poitiers to discuss these matters , with the date of the meeting scheduled as all saints day in 1306 , though it later had to be postponed due to the pope 's illness with gastro-enteritis some time later , as he was about to be executed , he appealed '' from this your heinous judgement to the living and true god , who is in heaven '' , warning the pope that , within a year and a day , he and philip iv would be obliged to answer for their crimes in god 's presence the plan was to coordinate actions between the christian military orders , the king of cyprus , the nobility of cyprus , the forces of cilician armenia , and a new potential ally , the mongols of the ilkhanate ( persia ) , to oppose the egyptian mamluks and take back the coastal city of tartus in syria '' the demolay degree , in which players dress in robes and other period costume , and appear on a dimly-lit stage whereupon they dramatically deliver memorized lines prescribed in the ritual , is described therein as depicting '' the tragic climax in the career of jacques demolay , the hero and martyr who is the exemplar of our order the last templar - the tragedy of jacques de molay , last grand master of the temple ( translated into english by antonia nevill ) , profile books ltd , ( first publication in france in 2002 as jacques de molay : le crépuscule des templiers by éditions payot & rivages ) the story of de molay 's brave defiance of his inquisitors has been incorporated in various forms into masonic lore ; most notably in the form of a youth group for young men aged 12 to 21 , sponsored by freemasonry , and named after the last grand master of the knights templar the force was commanded by king henry ii of jerusalem , the king of cyprus , accompanied by his brother , amalric , lord of tyre , and the heads of the military orders , with the ambassador of the mongol leader ghazan also in attendance the sudden arrest of the templars , the conflicting stories about confessions , and the dramatic deaths by burning , generated many stories and legends about both the order , and its last grand master he did not arrive until late summer , so while waiting for his arrival , molay met the pope to discuss other matters , one of which was the charges by one or more ousted templars who had made accusations of impropriety in the templars ' initiation ceremony in 1265 , as a young man , he was received into the order of the templars in a chapel at the beaune house , by humbert de pairaud , the visitor of france and england les templiers , une chevalerie chrétienne au moyen-âge , alain demurger on 14 september , philip took advantage of the rumors and inquiry to begin his move against the templars , sending out a secret order to his agents in all parts of france to implement a mass arrest of all templars at dawn on 13 october in september 2001 , barbara frale found a copy of the chinon parchment in the vatican secret archives , a document which explicitly confirms that in 1308 pope clement v absolved jacques de molay and other leaders of the order including geoffroi de charney and hugues de pairaud & nbsp ; the cord which the templars wore over the shirt day and night as a symbol of chastity had been consecrated by wrapping it around an idol in the form of a human head with a great beard , and this head was adored in the chapters & nbsp ; king philip iv of france , deeply in debt to the templars , was in favor of merging the orders under his own command , thereby making himself rex bellator , or war king in the autumn of 1296 , molay was back in cyprus to defend his order against the interests of henry ii of cyprus , which conflict had its roots back in the days of guillaume de beaujeu 357 '' the account given by the continuator of william nangis is confirmed by the clerk , geoffrey of paris , apparently an eyewitness , who describes molay as showing no sign of fear and , significantly , as telling those present that god would avenge their deaths molay was in paris on 12 october , where he was a pallbearer at the funeral of catherine of courtenay , wife of count charles of valois , and sister-in-law of king philip subsequently , the charges would be increased and would become , according to the procedures , lists of articles 86 to 1273 in which will be added a few other charges , such as the prohibition to priests who do not belong to the order philip and clement v both died within a year of molay 's execution ;
