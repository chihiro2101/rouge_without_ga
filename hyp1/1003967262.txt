784 by his own admission , he was not interested in social psychology when he arrived at iowa , and did not take a single course in social psychology during his entire time there ; instead , he was interested in lewin 's earlier work on tension systems , but lewin 's focus had shifted to social psychology by the time festinger arrived at iowa although the proximity effect ( or propinquity ) was an important direct finding from the study , festinger and his collaborators also noticed correlations between the degree of friendship within a group of residents and the similarity of opinions within the group , zukier , 1989 , p festinger , 1943c explaining his lack of interest in social psychology at the time , festinger stated , '' the looser methodology of the social psychology studies , and the vagueness of relation of the data to lewinian concepts and theories , all seemed unappealing to me in my youthful penchant for rigor 11 he '' became a symbol of the tough-minded , theory-oriented , pure experimental scientist , '' while ron lippitt , a fellow faculty member at lewin 's research center for group dynamics with whom festinger often clashed , '' became a symbol of the fuzzy-minded , do-gooder , practitioner of applied social psychology 104 festinger also received considerable recognition during this time for his work , both from within the field , being awarded the distinguished scientific contribution award by the american psychological association in 1959 , american , 1959 and outside of the field , being named as one of america 's ten most promising scientists by fortune magazine shortly after publishing social comparison theory 237 however , festinger continued to pursue his original interests , studying level of aspiration , festinger , 1942 working on statistics , festinger , 1943a festinger , 1943b developing a quantitative model of decision making , carlsmith & festinger , 1943 and even publishing a laboratory study on rats 2000 ( accessed april 28 , 2008 ) after graduating , festinger worked as a research associate at iowa from 1941 to 1943 , and then as a statistician for the committee on selection and training of aircraft pilots at the university of rochester from 1943 to 1945 during world war ii 11 perhaps one of the greatest impacts of festinger 's studies lies in their '' depiction of social behavior as the responses of a thinking organism continually acting to bring order into his world , rather than as the blind impulses of a creature of emotion and habit , '' as cited in his distinguished scientific contribution award 103 despite such recognition , festinger left the field of social psychology in 1964 , attributing his decision to '' a conviction that had been growing in me at the time that i , personally , was in a rut and needed an injection of intellectual stimulation from new sources to continue to be productive writing in 1983 , four years after closing his laboratory , festinger expressed a sense of disappointment with what he and his field had accomplished : : forty years in my own life seems like a long time to me and while some things have been learned about human beings and human behavior during this time , progress has not been rapid enough ; nor has the new knowledge been impressive enough 237–238 indeed , stanley schachter , festinger 's student and research assistant at the time , states , '' i was lucky enough to work with festinger at this time , and i think of it as one of the high points of my scientific life festinger , 1954 following this , in 1957 , festinger published his theory of cognitive dissonance , arguably his most famous and influential contribution to the field of social psychology it was at mit that festinger , in his own words , '' became , by fiat , a social psychologist , and immersed myself in the field with all its difficulties , vaguenesses , and challenges 11 in addition , festinger is credited with the ascendancy of laboratory experimentation in social psychology as one who '' converted the experiment into a powerful scientific instrument with a central role in the search for knowledge 100 he proceeded to study under kurt lewin at the university of iowa , where festinger received his ma in 1940 and phd in 1942 in the field of child behavior 106 festinger 's next and final enterprise was to understand why an idea is accepted or rejected by a culture , and he decided that examining why new technology was adopted quickly in the west but not in the eastern byzantine empire would illuminate the issue festinger , 1950 after lewin 's death in 1947 , festinger moved with the research center to the university of michigan in 1948 festinger , 1950 festinger argued that people depend on social reality to determine the subjective validity of their attitudes and opinions , and that they look to their reference group to establish social reality ; an opinion or attitude is therefore valid to the extent that it is similar to that of the reference group when there is a range of opinion or ability in a group , the relative strength of the three manifestations of pressures toward uniformity will be different for those who are close to the mode of the group than those who are distant from the mode festinger , 1983 although seemingly the product of a disillusioned , wholesale abandonment of the field of psychology , festinger considered this research as a return to the fundamental concerns of psychology 170 also , while festinger is praised for his theoretical rigor and experimental approach to social psychology , he is regarded as having contributed to '' the estrangement between basic and applied social psychology in the united states in 1945 , festinger joined lewin 's newly formed research center for group dynamics at the massachusetts institute of technology as an assistant professor to use festinger 's example of a smoker who has knowledge that smoking is bad for his health , the smoker may reduce dissonance by choosing to quit smoking , by changing his thoughts about the effects of smoking ( e.g he described the goal of his new research interests as “ seeing what can be inferred from different vantage points , from different data realms , about the nature , the characteristics , of this species we call human , ” festinger , 1980 , p in 1968 , festinger returned to his native new york city , continuing his perception research at the new school , then known as the new school for social research festinger & carlsmith , 1959 with festinger 's theories and the research that they generated , '' the monolithic grip that reinforcement theory had held on social psychology was effectively and permanently broken during this time , festinger published his highly influential paper on social comparison theory , extending his prior theory regarding the evaluation of attitudes in social groups to the evaluation of abilities in social groups festinger 's influential social comparison theory ( 1954 ) can be viewed as an extension of his prior theory related to the reliance on social reality for evaluating attitudes and opinions to the realm of abilities warning against the dangers of such demands when theoretical concepts are not yet fully developed , festinger stated , '' research can increasingly address itself to minor unclarities in prior research rather than to larger issues ; people can lose sight of the basic problems because the field becomes defined by the ongoing research festinger , 1957 some also view this as an extension of festinger 's prior work on group pressures toward resolving discrepancies in attitudes and abilities within social groups to how the individual resolves discrepancies at the cognitive level he further argued that pressures to communicate arise when discrepancies in opinions or attitudes exist among members of a group , and laid out a series hypotheses regarding determinants of when group members communicate , whom they communicate with , and how recipients of communication react , citing existing experimental evidence to support his arguments for example , liking was simply a function of reward according to behaviorism , so greater reward would produce greater liking ; festinger and carlsmith 's experiment clearly demonstrated greater liking with lower reward , a result that required the acknowledgement of cognitive processes specifically , those close to the mode of the group will have stronger tendencies to change the positions of others , relatively weaker tendencies to narrow the range of comparison , and much weaker tendencies to change their position compared to those who are distant from the mode of the group when doomsday came and went , martin claimed that the world had been spared because of the '' force of good and light '' festinger , riecken , & schachter , 1956 , p thus festinger suggested that the '' social influence processes and some kinds of competitive behavior are both manifestations of the same socio-psychological process.namely , the drive for self evaluation and the necessity for such evaluation being based on comparison with other persons some subjects , who were led to believe that their participation in the experiment had concluded , were then asked to perform a favor for the experimenter by telling the next participant , who was actually a confederate , that the task was extremely enjoyable 138 festinger also discussed implications of social comparison theory for society , hypothesizing that the tendency for people to move into groups that hold opinions which agree with their own and abilities that are near their own results in the segmentation of society into groups which are relatively alike xxi '' the most important development in social psychology to date , '' as cited in aronson , 1991 , p festinger , schachter , & back , 1950 indeed , festinger 's seminal 1950 paper on informal social communication as a function of pressures toward attitude uniformity within a group cites findings from this seemingly unrelated housing satisfaction study multiple times '' festinger , a professed atheist , was an original thinker and a restless , highly motivated individual with ( in his words ) '' little tolerance for boredom '' 545 festinger and ballou were later divorced , and festinger married trudy bradley , currently a professor of social work at new york university , faculty profile , n.d in 1943 , festinger married mary oliver ballou , a pianist , '' deaths : mary ballou festinger , '' 2006 with whom he had three children , catherine , richard , and kurt belief perseverance cognitive dissonance elliot aronson kurt lewin propinquity social comparison theory social psychology stanley schachter the great disappointment when prophecy fails the group studied a small apocalyptic cult led by dorothy martin ( under the pseudonym marian keech in the book ) , a suburban housewife to use festinger 's example , a chess novice does not compare his chess abilities to those of recognized chess masters , festinger , 1954 , p festinger and his collaborators , henry riecken and stanley schachter , examined conditions under which disconfirmation of beliefs leads to increased conviction in such beliefs in the 1956 book when prophecy fails 253 he also stressed that laboratory experimentation '' can not exist by itself , '' but that '' there should be an active interrelation between laboratory experimentation and the study of real-life situations in his 1950 paper , festinger postulated that one of the major pressures to communicate arises from uniformity within a group , which in turn arises from two sources : social reality and group locomotion festinger labeled communications arising from such pressures toward uniformity as '' instrumental communication '' in that the communication is not an end in itself but a means to reduce discrepancies between the communicator and others in the group 661 cognitive dissonance spawned decades of related research , from studies focused on further theoretical refinement and development greenwald & ronis , 1978 to domains as varied as decision making , the socialization of children , and color preference social comparison theory and cognitive dissonance have been described by other psychologists as '' the two most fruitful theories in social psychology 237 it was also at mit that festinger began his foray into social communication and pressures in groups that marked a turning point in his own research in his 1954 paper , festinger again systematically set forth a series of hypotheses , corollaries , and derivations , and he cited existing experimental evidence where available 236–239 the rumors functioned to reduce the inconsistency of people 's feelings of fear despite not directly experiencing the effects of the earthquake by giving people a reason to be fearful festinger , riecken , & schachter , 1956 mooney , 2011 martin claimed to have received messages from '' the guardians , '' a group of superior beings from another planet called 'clarion festinger 's seminal 1957 work integrated existing research literature on influence and social communication under his theory of cognitive dissonance festinger , 1957 the theory was motivated by a study of rumors immediately following a severe earthquake in india in 1934 215 cognitive dissonance has been variously described as '' social psychology 's most notable achievement , '' zukier , 1989 , p festinger & carlsmith , 1959 in the experiment , subjects were asked to perform an hour of boring and monotonous tasks ( i.e 4 festinger also later described the increased conviction and proselytizing by cult members after disconfirmation as a specific instantiation of cognitive dissonance ( i.e to the extent that objective , nonsocial means are available , people evaluate their opinions and abilities by comparison respectively with the opinions and abilities of others , smoking is not as bad for your health as others claim ) , or by acquiring knowledge pointing to the positive effects of smoking ( e.g the team showed that the formation of ties was predicted by propinquity , the physical proximity between where students lived , and not just by similar tastes or beliefs as conventional wisdom assumed the subjects paid 20 experienced less dissonance , as the large payment provided consonance with their behavior ; they therefore rated the task as less enjoyable and their ratings were similar to those who were not asked to perform the dissonance-causing favor festinger was born in brooklyn new york on may 8 , 1919 to russian-jewish immigrants alex festinger and sara solomon festinger festinger , stanley schachter , and kurt back examined the choice of friends among college students living in married student housing at mit when dissonance is present , in addition to trying to reduce it , the person will actively avoid situations and information which would likely increase the dissonance starting with the premise that humans have an innate drive to accurately evaluate their opinions and abilities , festinger postulated that people will seek to evaluate their opinions and abilities by comparing them with those of others 248 he turned his attention to the visual system , focusing on human eye movement and color perception he then moved to the university of minnesota in 1951 , and then on to stanford university in 1955 handbook of social psychology , vol 1 , theory and method , vol 2 , special fields and applications 784 behaviorism , which had dominated psychology until that time , characterized man as a creature of habit conditioned by stimulus-response reinforcement processes and even worse , from a broader point of view we do not seem to have been working on many of the important problems
