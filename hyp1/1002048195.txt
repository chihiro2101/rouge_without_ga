the latin phrase corresponding to the usage of quid pro quo in english is do ut des ( latin for '' i give , so that you may give '' ) other languages continue to use do ut des for this purpose , while quid pro quo ( or its equivalent qui pro quo , as widely used in italian , french and spanish ) still keeps its original meaning of something being unwillingly mistaken , or erroneously told or understood , instead of something else in 1654 , the expression quid pro quo was used to generally refer to something done for personal gain or with the expectation of reciprocity in the text the reign of king charles : an history disposed into annalls , with a somewhat positive connotation some examples of what could be used in place of what in this list are : '' pro uva passa dactili '' ( in place of raisins , use dates ) ; '' pro mirto sumac '' ( in place of myrtle , use sumac ) ; '' pro fenugreco semen lini '' ( in place of fenugreek , use flaxseed ) , etc in the united kingdom , the one-sidedness of a contract is covered by the unfair contract terms act 1977 and various revisions and amendments to it ; a clause can be held void or the entire contract void if it is deemed unfair ( that is to say , one-sided and not a quid pro quo ) ; however this is a civil law and not a common law matter to establish a prima facie case of '' quid pro quo '' harassment , the plaintiff must prove that they were subjected to '' unwelcome sexual conduct '' , that submission to such conduct was explicitly or implicitly a term of their employment , and submission to or rejection of this conduct was used as a basis for an employment decision , as follows : unwelcome sexual conduct : a court will look at the employee 's conduct to determine whether the supervisor 's sexual advances were unwelcome for languages that come from latin such as italian , portuguese , spanish and french , quid pro quo is used to define a misunderstanding or blunder made by the substituting of one thing for another quid is slang for pounds , the british currency , originating on this expression as in : if you want the quo you 'll need to give them some quid , which explains the plural without s , as in i gave them five hundred quid . although these terms are popular among lawyers and scholars , neither '' hostile work environment '' nor '' quid pro quo '' are found in title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 , which prohibits employers from discriminating on the basis of race , sex , color , national origin , and religion in common law , quid pro quo indicates that an item or a service has been traded in return for something of value , usually when the propriety or equity of the transaction is in question for example , when buying an item of clothing or a gallon of milk , a pre-determined amount of money is exchanged for the product the customer is purchasing ; therefore , they have received something but have given up something of equal value in return the vocabolario treccani ( an authoritative dictionary published by the encyclopedia treccani ) , under the entry '' qui pro quo '' , states that the latter expression probably derives from the latin used in late medieval pharmaceutical compilations '' once the plaintiff has established these three factors , the employer can not assert an affirmative defense ( such as the employer had a sexual harassment policy in place to prevent and properly respond to issues of sexual harassment ) , but can only dispute whether the unwelcome conduct did not in fact take place , the employee was not a supervisor , and that there was no tangible employment action involved
