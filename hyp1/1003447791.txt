estienne du tertre published suyttes de branle in 1557 , giving the first general use of the term '' suite '' 'suyttes ' in music , although the usual form of the time was as pairs of dances the '' classical '' suite consisted of allemande , courante , sarabande , and gigue , in that order , and developed during the 17th century in france , the gigue appearing later than the others johann jakob froberger is usually credited with establishing the classical suite through his compositions in this form , which were widely published and copied , although this was largely due to his publishers standardizing the order ; froberger 's original manuscripts have many different orderings of the movements , e.g the later addition of an overture to make up an '' overture-suite '' was extremely popular with german composers ; telemann claimed to have written over 200 overture-suites , christoph graupner wrote 86 orchestral overture-suites and 57 partitas for harpsichord , j françois couperin 's later suites ( which he called '' ordres '' ) often dispensed entirely with the standard dances and consisted entirely of character pieces with fanciful names by the 1750s , the suite had come to be seen as old-fashioned , superseded by the symphony and concerto , and few composers were still writing suites during that time arrangement into a suite can make the music more accessible and available to a wider audience , and has greatly helped popularize the music itself , such as in tchaikovsky 's suite from the nutcracker , or aaron copland 's suite from appalachian spring such suites may consist of : an instrumental selection from a larger work such as an opera , ballet , film score , or musical ; : a sequence of smaller pieces tied together by a common theme , such as the nationalistically inflected suites of grieg , sibelius , or tchaikovsky and the planets by holst ; : a work deliberately referential of baroque themes , as in the mischievous suite for piano by schoenberg debussy 's pour le piano is a suite in three movements , published in 1901 , and his suite bergamasque , revised in 1905 , is probably one of the most famous suites , especially the third movement , clair de lune modeled on the baroque keyboard suite , the piece consists of six movements entitled präludium ( prelude ) , gavotte , musette , intermezzo , menuett ( minuet , with trio ) , and gigue other famous examples of early 20th-century suites are the planets by gustav holst , a 'suite for orchestra ' in which each piece represents the astrology significance of one of the seven uninhabited planets then known , as well as his first suite in e-flat and second suite in f for military band a dance suite contains some of the following movements : prelude entrée ( ballet ) : sometimes an entrée is composed as part of a suite ; but there it is purely instrumental music and no dance is performed it begins on the last beat of an incomplete bar though the upbeat does not resolve until the end of each section ( unlike the bourée or gavotte where there can be a resolution of the upbeat ( s ) every three or four bars
