introduction of a more southerly route via milan , venice , and trieste the treaty of saint-germain contained a clause requiring austria to accept this train : formerly , austria allowed international services to pass through austrian territory ( which included trieste at the time ) only if they ran via vienna the 1930s saw the orient express services at its most popular , with three parallel services running : the orient express , the simplon orient express , and also the arlberg orient express , which ran via zürich and innsbruck to budapest , with sleeper cars running onwards from there to bucharest and athens each of the orient express services also incorporated sleeping cars which had run from calais to paris , thus extending the service from one end of continental europe to the other this was replaced in 1962 by a slower service called the direct orient express , which ran daily cars from paris to belgrade , and twice weekly services from paris to i̇stanbul and athens 1976 saw the withdrawal of the paris–athens direct service , and in 1977 , the direct orient express was withdrawn completely , with the last paris–i̇stanbul service running on 19 may of that year the

before ( via strasbourg , munich , and budapest ) with the opening of the lgv est paris–strasbourg high speed rail line on 10 june 2007 , the orient express service was further cut back to strasbourg–vienna , departing nightly at 22:20 from strasbourg , and still bearing the name , but lost the number 262/263 which was owned for decades in the last years through coaches between vienna and karlsruhe ( continuing first to dortmund , then to amsterdam , and finally – partly from budapest – to frankfurt ) were attached the last train with the name orient-express ( now with a hyphen )

route with four trains : paris–strasbourg , strasbourg–vienna , vienna–belgrade , and belgrade-i̇stanbul , each of which were operated daily train services across the border to turkey were stopped
