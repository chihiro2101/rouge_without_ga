the first albert bridge on the site was completed in july 1875 and enabled the main line railway from grandchester to ipswich to be extended to reach brisbane itself in the early days of settlement , the brisbane river at indooroopilly provided an obstacle to the construction of a railway between brisbane and the mining centre of ipswich in designing the bridge as two long spans with one central pier , he tried to minimise the obstruction to flood waters created by multiple piers , which had been the downfall of the first bridge messrs mccormick erected a workshop adjacent to the site at indooroopilly , and imported machinery necessary for constructing the superstructure and the caisson for the central pier up to 240 persons were employed on site at any one time , and quarry workers provided freestone from pearson 's quarries at helidon , the bluestone in the concrete from jenkin 's bundamba quarry , and the granite for the bedstones and cutwater quoins from mount crosby the shore end rested on two trolleys , and when the tide was at its highest , specially constructed staging on an old barque took the weight of the other end of the truss from temporary piles with increased traffic it was supplemented with an adjacent upstream rail bridge in 1957 , which together remained the only brisbane river rail crossing prior to construction of the merivale bridge in 1978 the albert bridge spans the brisbane river from indooroopilly to chelmer , at the junction of the chelmer and indooroopilly reaches it is a fully riveted structure consisting of two arched '' hogsback '' mild steel trusses supported on stone abutments either side , and on a central concrete pier albert bridge at indooroopilly is significant as an early , large span metal truss bridge in australia , and remains the country 's third longest span metal truss bridge albert bridge is significant for its contribution to the railway system linking the capital with southern and western queensland , remaining for over six decades part of the only railway link across the brisbane river it is important for its innovations in design and implementation , and remains a major example of the design skills of engineer hc stanley , and of the work of brisbane contractors john mccormick & son it is important for its innovations in design and implementation , and remains a major example of the design skills of engineer hc stanley , and of the work of brisbane contractors john mccormick & son
