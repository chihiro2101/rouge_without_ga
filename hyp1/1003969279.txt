the history of group dynamics ( or group processes ) has a consistent , underlying premise : 'the whole is greater than the sum of its parts in 1924 , gestalt psychologist max wertheimer proposed ‘ there are entities where the behaviour of the whole can not be derived from its individual elements nor from the way these elements fit together ; rather the opposite is true : the properties of any of the parts are determined by the intrinsic structural laws of the whole ’ ( wertheimer 1924 , p as a field of study , group dynamics has roots in both psychology and sociology wilhelm wundt ( 1832–1920 ) , credited as the founder of experimental psychology , had a particular interest in the psychology of communities , which he believed possessed phenomena ( human language , customs , and religion ) that could not be described through a study of the individual other key theorists include gustave le bon ( 1841–1931 ) who believed that crowds possessed a 'racial unconscious ' with primitive , aggressive , and antisocial instincts , and william mcdougall ( psychologist ) , who believed in a 'group mind , ' which had a distinct existence born from the interaction of individuals eventually , the social psychology kurt lewin ( 1890–1947 ) coined the term group dynamics to describe the positive and negative forces within groups of people in 1945 , he established the group dynamics research center at the massachusetts institute of technology , the first institute devoted explicitly to the study of group dynamics gustave le bon was a french social psychologist whose seminal study , the crowd : a study of the popular mind ( 1896 ) led to the development of group psychology the british psychologist william mcdougall in his work the group mind ( 1920 ) researched the dynamics of groups of various sizes and degrees of organization in group psychology and the analysis of the ego , ( 1922 ) , sigmund freud based his preliminary description of group psychology on le bon 's work , but went on to develop his own , original theory , related to what he had begun to elaborate in totem and taboo theodor adorno reprised freud 's essay in 1951 with his freudian theory and the pattern of fascist propaganda , and said that '' it is not an overstatement if we say that freud , though he was hardly interested in the political phase of the problem , clearly foresaw the rise and nature of fascist mass movements in purely psychological categories kurt lewin ( 1943 , 1948 , 1951 ) is commonly identified as the founder of the movement to study groups scientifically schutz referred to these group dynamics as '' the interpersonal underworld , '' group processes which are largely unseen and un-acknowledged , as opposed to '' content '' issues , which are nominally the agenda of group meetings wilfred bion ( 1961 ) studied group dynamics from a psychoanalysis perspective , and stated that he was much influenced by wilfred trotter for whom he worked at university college hospital london , as did another key figure in the psychoanalytic movement , ernest jones he discovered several mass group processes which involved the group as a whole adopting an orientation which , in his opinion , interfered with the ability of a group to accomplish the work it was nominally engaged in yalom , the theory and practice of group psychotherapy , third edition , basic books ( 1985 ) , hardback , bion 's experiences are reported in his published books , especially experiences in groups tuckman 's model states that the ideal group decision-making process should occur in four stages : forming ( pretending to get on or get along with others ) storming ( letting down the politeness barrier and trying to get down to the issues even if tempers flare up ) norming ( getting used to each other and developing trust and productivity ) performing ( working in a group to a common goal on a highly efficient and cooperative basis ) tuckman later added a fifth stage for the dissolution of a group called adjourning this model refers to the overall pattern of the group , but of course individuals within a group work in different ways hackman suggested that groups are successful when they satisfy internal and external clients , develop capabilities to perform in the future , and when members find meaning and satisfaction in the group these include : being a real team : which results from having a shared task , clear boundaries which clarify who is inside or outside of the group , and stability in group membership intragroup dynamics ( also referred to as ingroup- , within-group , or commonly just ‘ group dynamics ’ ) are the underlying processes that give rise to a set of norms , roles , relations , and common goals that characterize a particular social group examples of groups include religious , political , military , and environmental groups , sports teams , work groups , and therapy groups amongst the members of a group , there is a state of interdependence , through which the behaviours , attitudes , opinions , and experiences of each member are collectively influenced by the other group members in many fields of research , there is an interest in understanding how group dynamics influence individual behaviour , attitudes , and opinions in contrast , the social identity approach suggests that a group starts when a collection of individuals perceive that they share some social category ( ‘ smokers ’ , ‘ nurses , ’ ‘ students , ’ ‘ hockey players ’ ) , and that interpersonal attraction only secondarily enhances the connection between individuals joining a group is determined by a number of different factors , including an individual 's personal traits ; gender ; social motives such as need for affiliation , need for power , and need for intimacy ; attachment style ; and prior group experiences however , joining a group may also cost an individual time , effort , and personal resources as they may conform to social pressures and strive to reap the benefits that may be offered by the group the minimax principle is a part of social exchange theory that states that people will join and remain in a group that can provide them with the maximum amount of valuable rewards while at the same time , ensuring the minimum amount of costs to themselves in john thibaut and harold kelley 's social exchange theory , comparison level is the standard by which an individual will evaluate the desirability of becoming a member of the group and forming new social relationships within the group according to the social exchange theory , group membership will be more satisfying to a new prospective member if the group 's outcomes , in terms of costs and rewards , are above the individual 's comparison level to summarize , if membership in the group is above the comparison level for alternatives and above the comparison level , the membership within the group will be satisfying and an individual will be more likely to join the group a social group is characterized by a formally organized group of individuals who are not as emotionally involved with each other as those in a primary group the degree of entitativity that a group has is influenced by whether a collection of individuals experience the same fate , display similarities , and are close in proximity if individuals believe that a group is high in entitativity , then they are likely to believe that the group has unchanging characteristics that are essential to the group , known as essentialism in contrast , one 's social identity is defined by his or her group membership , and the general characteristics ( or prototypes ) that define the group and differentiate it from others that is , to be similar to others ( those who you share group membership with ) , but also to be different from others ( those who are outside of your group ) in the social sciences , group cohesion refers to the processes that keep members of a social group connected it is thought to be one of the most important characteristics of a group , and has been linked to group performance , group conflict and therapeutic change as an extension of lewin 's work , festinger ( along with stanley schachter and kurt back ) described cohesion as , “ the total field of forces which act on members to remain in the group ” ( festinger , schachter , & back , 1950 , p for example , studies have found that individuals work harder and faster when others are present ( see social facilitation ) , and that an individual 's performance is reduced when others in the situation create distraction or conflict this type of influence is often useful in the context of work settings , team sports , and political activism however , the influence of groups on the individual can also generate extremely negative behaviours , evident in nazi germany , the my lai massacre , and in the abu ghraib prison ( also see abu ghraib torture and prisoner abuse ) a key role in a group is the leader , but there are other important roles as well , including task roles , relationship roles , and individual roles individuals engaged in task roles focus on the goals of the group and on enabling the work that members do ; examples of task roles include coordinator , recorder , critic , or technician a group member engaged in a relationship role ( or socioemotional role ) is focused on maintaining the interpersonal and emotional needs of the groups ' members ; examples of relationship role include encourager , harmonizer , or compromiser they are a fundamental aspect of group structure as they provide direction and motivation , and organize the social interactions of members clapping after a speech ) injunctive norms : describe behaviours that people ought to do ; more evaluative in nature than a descriptive norm intermember relations are the connections among the members of a group , or the social network within a group examining the intermember relations of a group can highlight a group 's density ( how many members are linked to one another ) , or the degree centrality of members ( number of ties between members ) analysing the intermember relations aspect of a group can highlight the degree centrality of each member in the group , which can lead to a better understanding of the roles of certain group ( e.g when a group is first formed the members may all be on an equal level , but over time certain members may acquire status and authority within the group ; this can create what is known as a pecking order within a group in a study of dynamogenic stimulation for the purpose of explaining pacemaking and competition in 1898 , norman triplett theorized that '' the bodily presence of another rider is a stimulus to the racer in arousing the competitive instinct in the first—audience effects—zajonc observed behaviour in the presence of passive spectators , and the second—co-action effects—he examined behaviour in the presence of another individual engaged in the same activity in his theory of social facilitation , zajonc concluded that in the presence of others , when action is required , depending on the task requirement , either social facilitation or social interference will impact the outcome of the task if social facilitation occurs , the task will have required a dominant response from the individual resulting in better performance in the presence of others , whereas if social interference occurs the task will have elicited a nondominant response from the individual resulting in subpar performance of the task in some cases , intergroup dynamics is prosocial , positive , and beneficial ( for example , when multiple research teams work together to accomplish a task or goal ) similarly , underlying the 1999 columbine high school massacre in littleton , colorado , united states , intergroup dynamics played a significant role in eric harris and dylan klebold ’ s decision to kill a teacher and 14 students ( including themselves ) according to social identity theory , intergroup conflict starts with a process of comparison between individuals in one group ( the ingroup ) to those of another group ( the outgroup ) in the process of such comparisons , an individual tends to : ingroup favoritism over the outgroup exaggerate and overgeneralize the differences between the ingroup and the outgroup ( to enhance group distinctiveness ) minimize the perception of differences between ingroup members remember more detailed and positive information about the ingroup , and more negative information about the outgroup even without any intergroup relations ( as in the minimal group paradigm ) , individuals begin to show favouritism towards their own group , and negative reactions towards the outgroup intergroup conflict can be highly competitive , especially for social groups with a long history of conflict ( for example , the 1994 rwandan genocide , rooted in group conflict between the ethnic hutu and tutsi ) in contrast , intergroup competition can sometimes be relatively harmless , particularly in situations where there is little history of conflict ( for example , between students of different universities ) leading to relatively harmless generalizations and mild competitive behaviours further , he suggested four optimal conditions for contact : equal status between the groups in the situation ; common goals ; intergroup cooperation ; and the support of authorities , law , or customs despite strong evidence for the effectiveness of the jigsaw classroom , the strategy was not widely used ( arguably because of strong attitudes existing outside of the schools , which still resisted the notion that racial and ethnic minority groups are equal to whites and , similarly , should be integrated into schools ) group processes & intergroup relations group dynamics : theory , research , and practice small group research group analysis international journal of group psychotherapy
