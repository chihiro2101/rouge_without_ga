further presidential proclamations of 16 february 1909 ( in the last months of the roosevelt administration ) and 10 june , and in 1925 ( by calvin coolidge ) expanded the tongass after the creation of the tongass national forest , the central council of the tlingit and haida indian tribes of alaska formed to challenge the federal government 's rights to the land in 1935 the court found the alaska purchase between russia and the united states did not extinguish aboriginal title to the land , and that the creation of the tongass national forest constituted a taking of land from the tlingit and haida in the 1950s , in part to aid in japanese recovery from world war ii , the forest service set up long-term contracts with two pulp mills : the ketchikan pulp company ( kpc ) and the alaska pulp company the battle for buffer strips , to protect salmon streams from logging , which began in the zieske v butz lawsuit , continued through comments submitted to the major us forest service environmental impact statements issued in subsequent 5-year intervals starting in 1979 , and continuing in the 1988 eis finally , in 1990 , a federal district court in alaska , in a case called stein v barton , held the us forest service had to protect all salmon streams in the tongass with buffer strips one of the claims in stein v barton for protection of the salmon bay watershed was partially enacted into law when congress passed the tongass timber reform act ; however environmental lobbyists compromised with senator ted stevens leaving the most valuable forest available to logging in the headwaters of the salmon streams therein alaska pulp corporation and ketchikan pulp corporation claimed that the new restrictions made them uncompetitive and closed down their mills in 1993 and 1997 , respectively , and the forest service then cancelled the remainders of the two 50-year timber contracts in 2003 , an appropriations bill rider required that all timber sales in the tongass must be positive sales , meaning no sales could be sold that undervalued the '' stumpage '' rate , or the value of the trees as established by the marketplace ( 2008 appropriations bill p.l given the guaranteed low prices during contract days and the continued high cost of logging in southeast alaska today , one analysis concludes that , since 1980 , the forest service has lost over one billion dollars in tongass timber sales the forest service likens the overall deficit of the timber harvest program to the many other programs the agency operates at a deficit , including trail , cabin , and campground maintenance and subsistence programs comments to the chief of the forest service on the exemption of the tongass national forest from the roadless rule for example , the forest type with the largest concentration of big trees—volume class 7—originally comprised only 4 % of the forested portion of the tongass , and over two-thirds of it has been logged the road system that exists in the region is in place because of the resource extraction history in the region , primarily established by the forest service to enable timber harvest however , installing roads in the vast wilderness areas of the tongass is also a point of controversy for many in the american public , as reflected in the roadless area conservation movement , which has opposed further road construction on the grounds that it would promote habitat fragmentation , diminish wildlife populations and damage salmon spawning streams the tongass national forest was included in the roadless initiative passed on 5 january 2001 , during the last days of the bill clinton administration , and the initiative prevented the construction of new roads in currently roadless areas of united states national forests proponents of the amendment said that the federal timber program in tongass is a dead loss for taxpayers , costing some 30 & nbsp ; million annually , and noted that the forest service faces an estimated 900 & nbsp ; million road maintenance backlog in the forest in march 2011 , judge john sedwick from the anchorage federal district court , in his ruling , a court order , ruling the tongass exemption from the roadless rule invalid , judge sedwick ( u.s trump 's forest service removed most of the tongass national forest from roadless area designation in october 2020 , allowing road construction and logging in more than 9.3 & nbsp ; million acres of rainforest thirty-one communities are located within the forest ; the largest is juneau , the state capital , with a population of 31,000 the forest is named for the tongass group of the tlingit people , who inhabited the southernmost areas of southeast alaska , near what is now the city of ketchikan along with british columbia coast designated as the great bear rainforest , the tongass is part of the '' perhumid rainforest zone '' , and the forest is primarily made up of western red cedar , sitka spruce , and western hemlock though its land area is huge , about 40 % of the tongass is composed of wetlands , snow , ice , rock , and non-forest vegetation , while the remaining are forested from largest to smallest , they are : misty fjords national monument kootznoowoo wilderness tracy arm-fords terror wilderness stikine-leconte wilderness russell fjord wilderness south baranof wilderness west chichagof-yakobi wilderness endicott river wilderness south prince of wales wilderness south etolin wilderness chuck river wilderness tebenkof bay wilderness kuiu wilderness petersburg creek-duncan salt chuck wilderness karta river wilderness pleasant/lemesurier/inian islands wilderness coronation island wilderness warren island wilderness maurille islands wilderness there are three other wilderness areas within the alaska panhandle region that are not part of the tongass national forest , but are administered by the united states fish and wildlife service as part of the alaska maritime national wildlife refuge also in southeast alaska , but not in the tongass national forest , are the glacier bay wilderness and a small part of the wrangell-saint elias wilderness , which are both administered by the national park service the forest service provides visitor programs at the mendenhall glacier visitor center in juneau and the southeast alaska discovery center in ketchikan transference of public national forest land to a privately owned corporation removes it from protection by federal law and allows the owners to use the land in whatever way they see fit without regard to the effects of the use on surrounding lands and ecosystems known as the sealaska lands bill , the removal of 91,000 acres from the regulatory protections of the usfs and transfer of the land to sealaska , a for profit corporation , created a huge controversy in south east alaska a study released by audubon alaska on 22 february 2012 showed that the sealaska selection of the largest trees in areas designated in s 730 and hr 1408 is 1200 percent greater than the occurrence of these trees in the tongass as a whole
