typical requirements which are considered in the design process are : the filter should have a specific frequency response the filter should have a specific phase shift or group delay the filter should have a specific impulse response the filter should be causal the filter should be stable the filter should be localized ( pulse or step inputs should result in finite time outputs ) the computational complexity of the filter should be low the filter should be implemented in particular hardware or software digital filters are classified into one of two basic forms , according to how they respond to a unit impulse : finite impulse response , or fir , filters express each output sample as a weighted sum of the last n input samples , where n is the order of the filter a consequence of applying a filter to a signal is , in intuitive terms , that the duration of the local phenomena is extended by the width of the filter parts of the design problem relate to the fact that certain requirements are described in the frequency domain while others are expressed in the signal domain and that these may contradict as stated by the gabor limit , an uncertainty principle , the product of the width of the frequency function and the width of the impulse response can not be smaller than a specific constant additionally , since the phase shift is inherently a non-linear function of frequency , the time delay through such a filter is frequency-dependent , which can be a problem in many situations according to the uncertainty relation of the fourier transform , the product of the width of the filter 's impulse response function and the width of its frequency function must exceed a certain constant the ideal impulse response can be chosen independently of the ideal frequency function and is in practice used to limit the effective width and to remove ringing effects of the resulting filter in the signal domain in this case , a significant reduction in computational complexity can be obtained if the filter can be separated as the convolution of one 1d filter in the horizontal direction and one 1d filter in the vertical direction however , in certain applications it may be the filter 's impulse response that is explicit and the design process then aims at producing as close an approximation as possible to the requested impulse response given all other requirements this implies that if a specific frequency function is requested , corresponding to a specific frequency width , the minimum width of the filter in the signal domain is set such a filter contains internal state , and the output and the next internal state are determined by a linear combination of the previous inputs and outputs ( in other words , they use feedback , which fir filters normally do not ) if the filter is a part of a larger system ( which it normally is ) these types of delays have to be introduced with care since they affect the operation of the entire system the optimal filter can still be calculated by solving a simple least squares problem and the resulting filter is then a '' compromise '' which has a total optimal fit to the ideal functions in both domains another issue related to computational complexity is separability , that is , if and how a filter can be written as a convolution of two or more simpler filters this is a typical example of contradictory requirements where the filter design process may try to find a useful compromise in relation to the desired frequency function , there may also be an accompanying weighting function , which describes , for each frequency , how important it is that the resulting frequency function approximates the desired one if the filter has many coefficients , for example in the case of multidimensional signals such as tomography data , it may be relevant to reduce the number of coefficients by removing those which are sufficiently close to zero the previous method can be extended to include an additional error term related to a desired filter impulse response in the signal domain , with a corresponding weighting function for example , we may want both a specific frequency function of the filter and that the resulting filter have a small effective width in the signal domain as possible an important parameter is the relative strength of the two weighting functions which determines in which domain it is more important to have a good fit relative to the ideal function .
