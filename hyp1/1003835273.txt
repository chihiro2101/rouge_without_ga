it begins at the back of the mouth , passing downwards through the rear part of the mediastinum , through the diaphragm , and into the stomach in humans , the esophagus generally starts around the level of the sixth cervical vertebra behind the cricoid cartilage of the trachea , enters the diaphragm at about the level of the tenth thoracic vertebra , and ends at the cardia of the stomach , at the level of the eleventh thoracic vertebra the upper parts of the esophagus and the upper esophageal sphincter receive blood from the inferior thyroid artery , the parts of the esophagus in the thorax from the bronchial artery and branches directly from the thoracic aorta , and the lower parts of the esophagus and the lower esophageal sphincter receive blood from the left gastric artery and the left inferior phrenic artery lymphatically , the upper third of the esophagus drains into the deep cervical lymph nodes , the middle into the superior and posterior mediastinal lymph nodes , and the lower esophagus into the gastric and celiac lymph nodes ; position the upper esophagus lies at the back of the mediastinum behind the trachea , adjoining along the tracheoesophageal stripe , and in front of the erector spinae muscles and the vertebral column the thoracic duct , which drains the majority of the body 's lymph , passes behind the esophagus , curving from lying behind the esophagus on the right in the lower part of the esophagus , to lying behind the esophagus on the left in the upper esophagus these constrictions are : at the start of the esophagus , where the laryngopharynx joins the esophagus , behind the cricoid cartilage where it is crossed on the front by the aortic arch in the superior mediastinum where the esophagus is compressed by the left main bronchus in the posterior mediastinum the esophageal hiatus where it passes through the diaphragm in the posterior mediastinum the esophagus is surrounded at the top and bottom by two muscular rings , known respectively as the upper esophageal sphincter and the lower esophageal sphincter the upper esophageal sphincter is an anatomical sphincter , which is formed by lower portion of inferior pharyngeal constrictor , also known as cricopharyngeal sphincter due to its relation with cricoid cartilage of the larynx anteriorly the lower esophageal sphincter , or gastroesophageal sphincter , surrounds the lower part of the esophagus at the junction between the esophagus and the stomach the upper striated muscle , and upper esophageal sphincter , are supplied by neurons with bodies in the nucleus ambiguus , whereas fibers that supply the smooth muscle and lower esophageal sphincter have bodies situated in the dorsal motor nucleus the gastro-esophageal junction ( also known as the esophagogastric junction ) is the junction between the esophagus and the stomach , at the lower end of the esophagus the pink color of the esophageal mucosa contrasts to the deeper red of the gastric mucosa , and the mucosal transition can be seen as an irregular zig-zag line , which is often called the z-line normally , the cardia of the stomach is immediately distal to the z-line and the z-line coincides with the upper limit of the gastric folds of the cardia ; however , when the anatomy of the mucosa is distorted in barrets esophagus the true gastro-eshophageal junction can be identified by the upper limit of the gastric folds rather than the mucosal transition there are two types of glands , with mucus-secreting esophageal glands being found in the submucosa , and esophageal cardiac glands , similar to cardiac glands of the stomach , located in the lamina propria and most frequent in the terminal part of the organ the upper third of the esophagus contains striated muscle , the lower third contains smooth muscle , and the middle third contains a mixture of both muscle is arranged in two layers : one in which the muscle fibers run longitudinal to the esophagus , and the other in which the fibers encircle the esophagus these are separated by the myenteric plexus , a tangled network of nerve fibers involved in the secretion of mucus and in peristalsis of the smooth muscle of the esophagus these rhythmic contractions occur both as a reflex response to food that is in the mouth , and also as a response to the sensation of food within the esophagus itself constriction of the upper and lower esophageal sphincters helps to prevent reflux ( backflow ) of gastric contents and acid into the esophagus , protecting the esophageal mucosa gerd of gastric acids from the stomach , infection , substances ingested ( for example , corrosives ) , some medications ( such as bisphosphonates ) , and food allergies can all lead to esophagitis in this condition , there is metaplasia of the lining of the lower esophagus , which changes from stratified squamous epithelia to simple columnar epithelia the progress of the cancer is tnm staging that measures how far into the esophageal wall the cancer has invaded , how many lymph nodes are affected , and whether there are any metastases in different parts of the body inserting a stent into the esophagus , or inserting a nasogastric tube , may also be used to ensure that a person is able to digest enough food and water because of the extensive venous plexus that exists between this vein and other veins , if portal hypertension occurs , the direction of blood drainage in this vein may reverse , with blood draining from the portal venous system , through the plexus two of the most common congenital malformations affecting the esophagus are an esophageal atresia where the esophagus ends in a blind sac instead of connecting to the stomach ; and an esophageal fistula – an abnormal connection between the esophagus and the trachea '' its existence in other animals and its relationship with the stomach was documented by the roman naturalist pliny the elder ( ad23–ad79 ) , and the peristalsis contractions of the esophagus have been documented since at least the time of galen by 1908 , an operation had been performed by voeckler to remove the esophagus , and in 1933 the first surgical removal of parts of the lower esophagus , ( to control esophageal cancer ) , had been conducted the nissen fundoplication , in which the stomach is wrapped around the lower esophageal sphincter to stimulate its function and control gerd , was first conducted by rudolph nissen in 1955 in the majority of vertebrates , the esophagus is simply a connecting tube , but in some birds , which regurgitate components to feed their young , it is extended towards the lower end to form a crop for storing food before it enters the true stomach however , some fish , including lampreys , chimaeras , and lungfish , have no true stomach , so that the esophagus effectively runs from the pharynx directly to the intestine , and is therefore somewhat longer in fish , the esophagus is often lined with columnar epithelium , and in amphibians , sharks and rays , the esophageal epithelium is ciliated , helping to wash food along , in addition to the action of muscular peristalsis contrary to popular belief , an adult human body would not be able to pass through the esophagus of a whale , which generally measures less than in diameter , although in larger baleen whales it may be up to when fully distended because of torsion , which is the rotation of the main body of the animal during larval development , the esophagus usually passes around the stomach , and opens into its back , furthest from the mouth in species that have undergone de-torsion , however , the esophagus may open into the anterior of the stomach , which is the reverse of the usual gastropod arrangement
