the å-sound originally had the same origin as the long sound in german and ( scandinavian , , english eel , hair ) historically , the å derives from the old norse long vowel ( spelled with the letter á ) , but over time , it developed to an sound in most scandinavian language varieties ( in swedish and norwegian , it has eventually reached the pronunciation in old swedish the use of the ligature æ and of ø ( originally also a variant of the ligature œ ) that represented the sounds and respectively were gradually replaced by new letters before 1917 , when spelling with the double a was common , some norwegian place names contained three or four consecutive a letters : for instance ( now , a river ) and ( blååsen , 'the blue ( '' blå '' ) ridge ( '' ås '' ) ' ) correct alphabetization in danish and norwegian places å as the last letter in the alphabet , the sequence being æ , ø , å in danish the correct sorting of aa depends on pronunciation - if the sound is pronounced as one sound it is sorted as å regardless of the sound is ' a ' or ' å ' ; thus , for example , the german city aachen is listed under å , as well as the danish city aabenraa in the swedish and finnish alphabets , å is sorted after z , as the third letter from the end , the sequence being å , ä , ö this is easiest to remember across the nordic languages , that danish and norwegian follow z first with e-mutated letters æ and ø and then the symbol with a one-stroke diacritic å while it is recommended to keep the å intact wherever possible , the next best thing is to use the older , double a spelling ( e.g image : pois pakkoruotsi.svg thumb the fact that å is a common letter in swedish while having no native use in finnish has led to it being used as a concise symbol for the swedish language in finland , as in this campaign to rid finnish schools of mandatory swedish because the finnish alphabet is derived from the swedish alphabet , å is carried over , but it has no native finnish use and is treated as in swedish the finnish name for å is ( '' swedish o '' ) , and is pronounced identically to o , which has the value it is not advised to substitute aa for å in finnish , as aa is already a common letter combination with the value its use quickly spread to all eastern dialects , but the cultural influence liège and covered three sounds , a long open o , a long close o or a long a , depending on the local varieties for example , the word ( house ) , in the standardized orthography is spelled , , , in dialectal writings å and å are also used in the practical orthography of chamorro , a language indigenous to the people of northern mariana islands and guam the letter '' å '' ( u+00c5 ) is also used throughout the world as the international symbol for the non-si unit ångström , a physical unit of length named after the sweden physicist anders jonas ångström the logo of the stargate series similarly features a stylized a with a circle above it , making it resemble an å as in stargåte ; in norwegian , means '' riddle ''
