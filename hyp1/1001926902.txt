the machine , which created uniformity in screws and allowed for the application of interchangeable parts ( a prerequisite for mass production ) , was a revolutionary development necessary for the industrial revolution his father was wounded in action and so in 1756 became an 'artificer ' at the royal arsenal , woolwich ( then in kent ) , where he remained until 1776 maudslay , henry ( 1771 & ndash ; 1831 ) , dictionary of national biography , vol maudslay was the fifth of seven children of henry maudslay , a wheelwright in the royal engineers , and margaret ( nee whitaker ) , the young widow of joseph laundy maudslay laid an important foundation for the industrial revolution with his machine tool technology but he did introduce the three-part combination of lead screw , slide rest , and change gears , sparking a great advance in machine tools and in the engineering use of screw threads he standardized the screw threads used in his workshop and produced sets of tap and die that would make nuts and bolts consistently to those standards , so that any bolt of the appropriate size would fit any nut of the same size he had trained in shipbuilding at northfleet and , with joshua field , became a partner in his father 's firm , trading as maudslay , sons and field of north lambeth and may not have been the first to combine a lead screw , slide rest , and set of change gears all on one lathe ( jesse ramsden may have done that in 1775 ; evidence is scant ) , roe 1916:38 mcfarland this allowed the concept of interchangeable parts ( an idea that was already taking hold ) to be practically applied to nuts and screw maudslay played his part in the development of mechanical engineering when it was in its infancy , but he was especially pioneering in the development of machine tools to be used in engineering workshops across the world maudslay developed the first industrially practical screw-cutting lathe in 1800 , allowing standardisation of screw thread sizes for the first time william , the second , became a civil engineer and was one of the founders of the institution of civil engineers when maudslay began working for bramah , the typical lathe was worked by a treadle and the workman held the cutting tool against the work this did not allow for precision , especially in cutting iron , so screw threads were usually made by chipping and filing ( that is , with skilled freehand use of chisels and files ) in 1791 he married bramah 's housemaid , sarah tindel , and they had four sons together : thomas henry , the eldest , and joseph , the youngest , subsequently joined their father in business the ability of the slide-rest lathe to produce precision parts revolutionised the production of machine components after two years , he was transferred to a carpenter 's shop followed by a blacksmith 's forge , where at the age of fifteen he began training as a blacksmith in 1797 , after having worked for bramah for eight years , maudslay was refused a wage increase to 30s a week so he decided to set up his own business
