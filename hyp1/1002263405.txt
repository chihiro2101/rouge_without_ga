chapter six ufos and electrogravity propulsion , did tesla discover the secrets of antigravity ? brown 's research and the '' biefeld–brown effect '' has since become something of a popular pursuit around the world , with amateur experimenters replicating his early experiments in the form of '' ionocraft '' powered by high voltage townsend brown , 2005-2006-2007-2008 - tanglewood books , chapter 13 : notes from the rabbit hole 3 : '' he made things up '' ( online excerpts ) working in his home lab brown developed an electrical device he called a '' gravitor '' or '' gravitator '' , consisting of a block of insulating or dielectric material with electrodes at either end ” scientists who have since studied brown 's devices have not found any anti-gravity effect , and have attributed the noticed motive force to the more well understood phenomenon of ionic drift or '' ion wind '' from the air particles , some of which still remained even when brown put his device inside a vacuum chamber chapter 10 of the book was titled '' the force fields of townsend brown '' , retelling of brown 's early work and claiming he was involved in the experiment and implying brown 's electrogravitics was the propulsion being used by ufos brown became involved in the subject of unidentified flying objects ( ufos ) and in 1956 helped found the national investigations committee on aerial phenomena ( nicap ) although he was forced out as director in 1957 with allegations that brown was using funds to further his own anti-gravity research in 1921 while experimenting in the lab his parents had set up for him while he was still in high school , brown discovered an unusual effect while experimenting with a coolidge tube , a type of x-ray vacuum tube with two asymmetrical electrodes death october 27 , 1985 per find a grave information for : joseph townsend brown and thomas townsend brown family website '' alienscientist.com , biefeld–brown effect controversy , tajmar esa experiments brown refined his invention over the years and eventually came up with designs consisting of metal plates or disks charged with 25,000 to 200,000 volts that would produce a propulsive force which he continued to claim was an anti-gravity force in october 1942 brown was discharged from navy service with brown requesting to resign '' for the good of the naval service in order to escape trial by general court martial '' and with his official discharge exam listing '' no comment '' as to the reasons why townsend brown , 2005-2006-2007-2008 - tanglewood books , chapter 64 : flying saucer pipe dreams ( online excerpts ) at some point it also gained the moniker '' biefeld–brown effect '' , probably coined by brown to claim biefeld as his mentor and co-experimenter the canonical hamiltonian the intersection of chip design and physics by hamilton carter , thomas townsend brown : part iv of the holiday serial brown was convinced that he had managed to influence gravity electrically a physicist invited to observe brown 's disk device in the early 50s noted during the demonstration that its motivation force was the well known phenomenon of '' electric wind '' , and not anti-gravity , saying “ i ’ m afraid these gentlemen played hooky from their high school physics classes… townsend brown , 2005-2006-2007-2008 - tanglewood books , chapter 12 : the “ biefeld-brown ” effect ( online excerpts ) '' townsend brown himself wrote ( in 1977 ) : the basic biefeld-brown effect is quite simple ; patents gb300311 — a method of and an apparatus or machine for producing force or motion ( accepted 1928-11-15 ) — electrostatic motor ( 1934-09-25 ) — electrokinetic apparatus ( 1960-08-16 ) — electrokinetic transducer ( 1962-01-23 ) — electrokinetic generator ( 1962-02-20 ) — electromagnetic apparatus ( 1965-06-01 ) — electric generator ( 1965-07-20 ) ; websites maintained by paul schatzkin , author of '' defying gravity : the parallel universe of t in research testing for the société nationale des constructions aéronautiques du sud-ouest ( sncaso ) , brown demonstrated what he thought was an antigravity effect in a vacuum with his device '' after quitting caltech brown studied one year at denison university where he claimed that he did a series of experiments with professor of astronomy paul alfred biefeld although the present day denison university claims they have no record of such experiments being carried out , or of any association between brown and biefeld in 1929 brown published '' how i control gravity '' , in science and invention , where he claimed these devices were producing a mysterious force that interacted with the pull of gravity
