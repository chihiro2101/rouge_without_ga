the smooth muscle of the bladder , known as the detrusor , is innervated by sympathetic nervous system fibers from the lumbar spinal cord and parasympathetic fibers from the sacrum spinal cord fibers in the pelvic nerves constitute the main afferent limb of the voiding reflex ; the parasympathetic fibers to the bladder that constitute the excitatory efferent limb also travel in these nerves part of the urethra is surrounded by the male or female external urethral sphincter , which is innervated by the somatic pudendal nerve originating in the cord , in an area termed onuf 's nucleus micturition is fundamentally a spinobulbospinal reflex facilitated and inhibited by higher brain centers such as the pontine micturition center and , like defecation , subject to voluntary facilitation and inhibition in healthy individuals , the lower urinary tract has two discrete phases of activity : the storage ( or guarding ) phase , when urine is stored in the bladder ; and the voiding phase , when urine is released through the urethra the state of the reflex system is dependent on both a conscious signal from the brain and the firing rate of sensory fibers from the bladder and urethra at low bladder volumes , afferent firing is low , resulting in excitation of the outlet ( the sphincter and urethra ) , and relaxation of the bladder in the adult , the volume of urine in the bladder that normally initiates a reflex contraction is about this phenomenon is a manifestation of the law of laplace , which states that the pressure in a spherical viscus is equal to twice the wall tension divided by the radius the bladder 's smooth muscle has some inherent contractile activity ; however , when its nerve supply is intact , stretch receptors in the bladder wall initiate a reflex contraction that has a lower threshold than the inherent contractile response of the muscle conversely , afferent input causes contraction of the sphincter through excitation of onuf 's nucleus , and contraction of the bladder neck and urethra through excitation of the sympathetic preganglionic neurons diuresis ( production of urine by the kidney ) occurs constantly , and as the bladder becomes full , afferent firing increases , yet the micturition reflex can be voluntarily inhibited until it is appropriate to begin voiding bladder afferent signals ascend the spinal cord to the periaqueductal gray , where they project both to the pontine micturition center and to the cerebrum when the external urinary sphincter is relaxed urine is released from the urinary bladder when the pressure there is great enough to force urine to flow out of the urethra urine remaining in the male urethra is expelled by several contractions of the bulbospongiosus muscle , and , by some men , manual squeezing along the length of the penis to expel the rest of the urine for land mammals over 1 kilogram , the duration of urination does not vary with body mass , being dispersed around an average of 21 seconds ( standard deviation 13 seconds ) , despite a 4 order of magnitude ( 1000Ã— ) difference in bladder volume new law of urination : mammals take 20 seconds to pee , carrie arnold , national geographic , 23 october 2013 this is due to increased urethra length of large animals , which amplifies gravitational force ( hence flow rate ) , and increased urethra width , which increases flow rate for smaller mammals a different phenomenon occurs , where urine is discharged as droplets , and urination in smaller mammals , such as mice and rats , can occur in less than a second another possibility is the excitation or disinhibition of neurons in the pontine micturition center , which causes concurrent contraction of the bladder and relaxation of the sphincter after transection of the brain stem just above the pons , the threshold is lowered and less bladder filling is required to trigger it , whereas after transection at the top of the midbrain , the threshold for the reflex is essentially normal in humans with lesions in the superior frontal gyrus , the desire to urinate is reduced and there is also difficulty in stopping micturition once it has commenced voluntary contraction of the abdominal muscles aids the expulsion of urine by increasing the pressure applied to the urinary bladder wall , but voiding can be initiated without straining even when the bladder is nearly empty in many males the feeling of the need to urinate can be sensed at the base of the penis as well as the bladder , even though the neural activity associated with a full bladder comes from the bladder itself , and can be felt there as well many clinical conditions can cause disturbances to normal urination , including : urinary incontinence , the inability to hold urine stress incontinence , incontinence as a result of external mechanical disturbances urge incontinence , incontinence that occurs as a result of the uncontrollable urge to urinate mixed incontinence , a combination of the two types of incontinence urinary retention , the inability to initiate urination overactive bladder , a strong urge to urinate , usually accompanied by detrusor overactivity interstitial cystitis , a condition characterized by urinary frequency , urgency , and pain prostatitis , an inflammation of the prostate gland that can cause urinary frequency , urgency , and pain benign prostatic hyperplasia , an enlargement of the prostate that can cause urinary frequency , urgency , retention , and the dribbling of urine urinary tract infection , which can cause urinary frequency and dysuria polyuria , abnormally large production of urine , associated with , in particular , diabetes mellitus ( types 1 and 2 ) , and diabetes insipidus oliguria , low urine output , usually due to a problem with the upper urinary tract anuria refers to absent or almost absent urine output bladder sphincter dyssynergia , a discoordination between the bladder and external urethral sphincter as a result of brain or spinal cord injury a drug that increases urination is called a diuretic , whereas antidiuretics decrease the production of urine by the kidneys there are three major types of bladder dysfunction due to neural lesions : ( 1 ) the type due to interruption of the afferent nerves from the bladder ; ( 2 ) the type due to interruption of both afferent and efferent nerves ; and ( 3 ) the type due to interruption of facilitatory and inhibitory pathways descending from the brain paruresis , also known as shy bladder syndrome , is an example of a bladder interruption from the brain that often causes total interruption until the person has left a public area when the sacral dorsal roots are cut in experimental animals or interrupted by diseases of the dorsal roots such as tabes dorsalis in humans , all reflex contractions of the bladder are abolished when the afferent and efferent nerves are both destroyed , as they may be by tumors of the cauda equina or filum terminale , the bladder is flaccid and distended for a while a common technique used in many undeveloped nations involves holding the child by the backs of the thighs , above the ground , facing outward , in order to urinate occasionally , if a male 's penis is damaged or removed , or a female 's genitals/urinary tract is damaged , other urination techniques must be used most often in such cases , doctors will reposition the urethra to a location where urination can still be accomplished , usually in a position that would promote urination only while seated/squatting , though a permanent urinary catheter may be used in rare cases sometimes urination is done in a container such as a bottle , urinal , bedpan , or chamber pot ( also known as a gazunder ) a container or wearable urine collection device may be used so that the urine can be examined for medical reasons or for a drug test , for a bedridden patient , when no toilet is available , or there is no other possibility to dispose of the urine immediately the latter can be unpleasant for the one who exposes them ( modesty , lack of privacy ) and/or those who can see them ; it can be avoided or mitigated by going to a quiet place and/or facing a tree or wall if urinating standing up , or while squatting , hiding the back behind walls , bushes , or a tree urination in a heavily wooded area is generally harmless , actually saves water , and may be condoned for males ( and less commonly , females ) in certain situations as long as common sense is used one proposed way to inhibit public urination due to drunkenness is the urilift , which is disguised as a normal manhole by day but raises out of the ground at night to provide a public restroom for bar-goers the new ourselves , growing older : women aging with knowledge and power , paula brown doress-worters , diana laskin siegal , boston women 's health book collective , simon & schuster , 1994 , page 301 the 5th-century bc historian herodotus , writing on the culture of the ancient persians and highlighting the differences with those of the greeks , noted that to urinate in the presence of others was prohibited among persians there was a popular belief in the uk , that it was legal for a man to urinate in public so long as it occurred on the rear wheel of his vehicle and he had his right hand on the vehicle , but this is not true in islamic toilet etiquette , it is haram to urinate while facing the qibla , or to turn one 's back to it when urinating or relieving bowels but modesty requirements for females make it impossible for girls to relieve themselves without facilities a literature review found cultural differences in socially accepted voiding positions around the world and found differences in preferred position : in the middle-east and asia , the squatting position was more prevalent , while in the western world the standing and sitting positions were more common since elimination of bodily wastes is , of necessity , a subject talked about with toddlers during toilet training , other expressions considered suitable for use by and with children exist , and some continue to be used by adults , e.g other expressions include '' squirting '' and '' taking a leak '' , and , predominantly by younger persons for outdoor female urination , '' popping a squat '' , referring to the position many women adopt in such circumstances british english uses '' going to see my aunt '' , '' going to see a man about a dog '' , '' to piddle '' , '' to splash ( one 's ) boots '' , as well as '' to have a slash '' , which originates from the scottish term for a large splash of liquid one of the most common , albeit old-fashioned , euphemisms in british english is '' to spend a penny '' , a reference to coin-operated pay toilets , which used ( decimal day ) to charge that sum usage in english includes : wikt : piss off ( to anger someone ; alternatively , to leave somewhere in a hurry ) piss off !
