, heart , brain , liver , stomach , skull , other bones ) check the amniotic fluid and umbilical cord for possible problems determine due date ( based on measurements and relative developmental progress ) generally an ultrasound is ordered whenever an abnormality is suspected or along a schedule similar to the following : 7 weeks — confirm pregnancy , ensure that it 's neither molar or ectopic , determine due date 13–14 weeks ( some areas ) — evaluate the possibility of down syndrome 18–20 weeks — see the expanded list above 34 weeks ( some areas ) — evaluate size , verify placental position a review looking at routine ultrasounds past 24 weeks found that there is no evidence to show any benefits to the mother or the baby physical examinations generally consist of : collection of ( mother 's ) medical history checking ( mother 's ) blood pressure ( mother 's ) height and weight pelvic exam doppler fetal heart rate monitoring ( mother 's ) blood and urine tests discussion with caregiver in some countries , such as the uk , the symphysial fundal height ( sfh ) is measured as part of antenatal appointments from 25 weeks gestation in a small study , mothers receiving high feedback were more likely to stop smoking and drinking alcohol however the quality of the study is low and more research is needed to say for certain which type of feedback is better prenatal diagnosis or prenatal screening ( note that '' prenatal diagnosis '' and '' prenatal screening '' refer to two different types of tests ) is testing for diseases or conditions in a fetus or embryo before it is born there are two types of growth chart : population based chart which shows a standard growth and size for each baby customized growth chart which is worked out by looking at the mother ’ s height and weight , and the weights of their previous babies however interventions used together may reduce baby deaths in pregnancy and early life , lower numbers of low birth weight babies born and improve numbers of women receiving antenatal care group antenatal care has a couple of obvious benefits : it costs less than one-to-one visits and the women have more hours of care as a group than on their own there are many ways of changing health systems to help women access antenatal care , such as new health policies , educating health workers and health service reorganisation while availability of such services have considerable personal health and social benefits , socioeconomic problems prevent its universal adoption in both developing and developed nations , such as the us midwife-led care for low-risk women is where a midwife team ( and gp if needed ) is leading the care a woman receives and she does not usually see a specialist doctor in her pregnancy there is little evidence behind the number of antenatal visits , pregnant women receive and what care and information is given at each visit if the mother goes to a different hospital for care or to give birth the summary of her case notes can be used by the midwives and doctors until her hospital notes arrive however , when this was tested , women with less visits had babies who were much more likely to be admitted to neonatal intensive care and stay there for longer ( though this could down to chance results )
