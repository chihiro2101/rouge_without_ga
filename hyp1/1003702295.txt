genes that encode hexokinase have been discovered in every domain of life , and exist among a variety of species that range from bacteria , yeast , and plants to humans and other vertebrates hexokinases i , ii , and iii are referred to as '' low-k m '' isozymes because of a high affinity for glucose ( below 1 mm ) hexokinase i/a is found in all mammalian tissues , and is considered a '' housekeeping enzyme , '' unaffected by most physiological , hormonal , and metabolic changes glucokinase can only phosphorylate glucose if the concentration of this substrate is high enough ; its km for glucose is 100 times higher than that of hexokinases i , ii , and iii hexokinase iv is monomeric , about 50kd , displays positive cooperativity with glucose , and is not allosterically inhibited by its product , glucose-6-phosphate hexokinase iv is present in the liver , pancreas , hypothalamus , small intestine , and perhaps certain other neuroendocrine cells , and plays an important regulatory role in carbohydrate metabolism in the beta cells of the pancreatic islets , it serves as a glucose sensor to control insulin release , and similarly controls glucagon release in the alpha cells glucose is unique in that it can be used to produce atp by all cells in both the presence and absence of molecular oxygen ( o 2 ) by catalyzing the phosphorylation of glucose to yield glucose 6-phosphate , hexokinases maintain the downhill concentration gradient that favors the facilitated transport of glucose into cells the addition of a charged phosphate group at the 6-position of hexoses also ensures 'trapping ' of glucose and 2-deoxyhexose glucose analogs ( e.g hexokinases i and ii can associate physically to the outer surface of the external membrane of mitochondria through specific binding to a porin , or voltage dependent anion channel
