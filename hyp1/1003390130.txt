rimbaud wrote to several famous poets but received either no reply or a disappointing mere acknowledgement ( as from theodore de banville ) ; so his friend , office employee charles auguste bretagne , advised him to write to paul verlaine , a rising poet who had published two well regarded collections ( and future leader of the symbolist movement ) rimbaud sent verlaine two letters with several of his poems , including the hypnotic , finally shocking '' le dormeur du val '' ( the sleeper in the valley ) , in which nature is called upon to comfort an apparently sleeping soldier in later published recollections of his first sight of rimbaud at the age of sixteen , verlaine described him as having '' the real head of a child , chubby and fresh , on a big , bony , rather clumsy body of a still-growing adolescent '' , with a '' very strong ardennes accent that was almost a dialect '' other writers , such as albert mérat , refused to be painted with verlaine and rimbaud , mérat 's reason being that he '' would not be painted with pimps and thieves '' , in reference to verlaine and rimbaud ; in the painting , mérat is replaced by a flower vase on the table mérat also spread many rumours in the salons that verlaine and rimbaud were sleeping together ; the spread of those rumours was the commencement of fall for the two poets , who were trying to build a good reputation for themselves in the work it is widely interpreted that he refers to verlaine as his '' pitiful brother '' ( frère pitoyable ) and the '' mad virgin '' ( vierge folle ) , and to himself as the '' hellish husband '' ( l'époux infernal ) , and described their life together as a '' domestic farce '' ( drôle de ménage ) they lived together for three months while he put together his groundbreaking illuminations , a collection of prose poems , although he eventually did not see it through publication ( it only got published in 1886 , without the author 's knowledge ) stéphane mallarmé , in a text about rimbaud from 1896 ( after his death ) , described him as a '' meteor , lit by no other reason than his presence , arising alone then vanishing '' who had managed to '' surgically remove poetry from himself while still alive '' albert camus , in l'homme révolté , although he praised rimbaud 's literary works ( particularly his later prose works , une saison en enfer and illuminations — '' he is the poet of revolt , and the greatest '' ) , wrote a scathing account of his resignation from literature — and revolt itself — in his later life , claiming that there is nothing to admire , nothing noble or even genuinely adventurous , in a man who committed a '' spiritual suicide '' , became a '' bourgeois traficker '' and consented to the materialistic order of things in the same year he left his job at bardey 's to become a merchant on his own account in harar , where his commercial dealings included coffee and ( generally outdated ) firearms '' he was , in fact , a pioneer in the business , the first european to oversee the export of the celebrated coffee of harar from the country where coffee was born the arms were landed at tadjoura in february , but could not be moved inland because léonce lagarde , governor of the new french administration of obock and its dependencies , issued an order on 12 april 1886 prohibiting the sale of weapons when the authorization came through from the consul de france , labatut got ill and had to withdraw ( he died from cancer soon afterward ) , then soleillet died from embolism on 9 october in their later testimonies , they both described him as an intelligent man , quiet , sarcastic , secretive about his prior life , living with simplicity , taking care of his business with accuracy , honesty and firmness after a short stay at the family farm in roche , from 23 july to 23 august , he attempted to travel back to africa , but on the way his health deteriorated , and he was re-admitted to the hôpital de la conception in marseille on the 100th anniversary of rimbaud 's birth , thomas bernhard delivered a memorial lecture on rimbaud and described his end : '' on november 10 , at two o'clock in the afternoon , he was dead , '' noted his sister isabelle the first known poems of arthur rimbaud were mostly emulating the style of the parnasse school and other famous contemporary poets like victor hugo , although he quickly developed an original approach , both thematically and stylistically ( in particular by mixing profane words and ideas with sophisticated verse , as in '' vénus anadyomène '' , '' oraison du soir '' or '' les chercheuses de poux '' ) the second letter , written 15 may—before his first trip to paris—to his friend paul demeny , expounded his revolutionary theories about poetry and life , while also denouncing some of the most famous poets that preceded him ( reserving a particularly harsh criticism for alfred de musset , while holding charles baudelaire in high regard , although , according to rimbaud , his vision was hampered by a too conventional style ) this is an unspeakable torture during which he needs all his faith and superhuman strength , and during which he becomes the great patient , the great criminal , the great accursed—and the great learned one ! —among men.—for he arrives at the unknown ! because he has cultivated his own soul—which was rich to begin with—more than any other man ! he reaches the unknown ; and even if , crazed , he ends up by losing the understanding of his visions , at least he has seen them ! let him die charging through those unutterable , unnameable things : other horrible workers will come ; they will begin from the horizons where he has succumbed !
