on 8 march 1949 , after the élysée accords , the state of vietnam was recognized by france as an independent country ruled by the vietnamese emperor bảo đại , and the vietnamese national army ( vna ) was soon created the vna fought in a wide range of campaigns including the battle of nà sản ( 1952 ) , operation atlas ( 1953 ) and the battle of dien bien phu ( 1954 ) right on 26 october 1955 , the military was reorganized by the administration of president ngô đình diệm who then formally established the army of the republic of vietnam ( arvn ) on 30 december 1955 early on , the focus of the army was the guerrilla fighters of the viet cong ( vc ) , formed to oppose the diệm administration a major campaign , developed by ngô đình nhu and later resurrected under another name was the '' strategic hamlet program '' which was regarded as unsuccessful by western media because it was '' inhumane '' to move villagers from the countryside to fortified villages arvn leaders and president diệm were criticized by the foreign press when the troops were used to crush armed anti-government religious groups like the cao đài and hòa hảo as well as to raid buddhist temples , which according to diệm , were harboring vc guerrillas the most notorious of these attacks occurred on the night of august 21 , 1963 , during the xá lợi pagoda raids conducted by the special forces , which caused a death toll estimated to range into the hundreds in the confusion that followed , general dương văn minh took control , but he was only the first in a succession of arvn generals to assume the presidency of south vietnam during these years , the united states began taking more control of the war against the vc and the role of the arvn became less and less significant although the american news media has often portrayed the vietnam war as a primarily american and north vietnamese conflict , the arvn carried the brunt of the fight before and after large-scale american involvement , and participated in many major operations with american troops arvn troops pioneered the use of the m113 armored personnel carrier as an infantry fighting vehicle by fighting mounted rather than as a '' battle taxi '' as originally designed , and the armored cavalry ( acav ) modifications were adopted based on arvn experience ( 1988 ) , united states army in vietnam : advice and support : the final

combined with a severe economic recession and mounting budget deficits , congress cut funding to south vietnam for the upcoming fiscal year from 1 & nbsp ; billion to 700 & nbsp ; million dollars historians have attributed the fall of saigon in 1975 to the cessation of american aid along with the growing disenchantment of the south vietnamese people and the rampant corruption and incompetence of south vietnam political leaders and arvn general staff without the necessary funds and facing a collapse in south vietnamese troop and civilian morale , it was becoming increasingly difficult for
