in 2020 , jürgen nagler defined a wellbeing mindset as '' the whole of attitudes , beliefs , and values of a person or group of people that foster wellbeing most historians use the concept of mentality or mindset to denote very slowly changing mental dispositions active over longer periods of time , but occasionally there have been efforts to also apply it to much more rapidly changing historical situations such as the french revolution ( michel vovelle ) or the short period of allied occupation of germany after world war ii ( hentschel 2007 ) collective mindsets in this sense are described in such works as hutchin 's '' cognition in the wild '' ( 1995 ) , who analyzes a whole team of naval navigators as the cognitive unit or as computational system , or senges ' knowledge entrepreneurship in universities ( 2007 ) one of the defining characteristics of the study of global mindset is the variety in which scholars conceptualize and operationalize the construct ; and yet ; scholars typically agree that global mindset and its development increases global effectiveness for both individuals and organizations ( french & chang , 2016 ) overall , it is clear to see that a classroom that includes challenging learning tasks , praising of the process , and explicit growth mindset teaching and assessment , is a classroom where students will have the tools needed to become lifelong learners in a 2012 interview , dweck defined both fixed and growth mindsets : an example of a person with a growth mindset is an employee who , when posed with an extraordinarily challenging assignment , takes the project as a growing opportunity instead of one that will defeat them according to these commentators , power groups that fail to review or revise their mindsets with sufficient regularity can not hold power indefinitely , as a single mindset is unlikely to possess the flexibility and adaptability needed to address all future events dweck 's research and theory of growth and fixed mindsets has been useful in intervention strategies with at risk students , dispelling negative stereotypes in education held by teachers and students , understanding the impacts of self-theories on resilience , and understanding how process praise can foster a growth mindset and positively impact students ' motivation levels and ussr , which included absolute trust in two-player game theory , in the integrity of command chain , in control of nuclear materials , and in the mutual assured destruction of both in the case of war hattie ( 2012 ) states , '' differing mindsets , or assumptions , that teachers possess about themselves and their students play a significant role in determining their expectations , teaching practices , and how students perceive their own mindset while a great deal of research in the education field has focused on a students ability to adopt a growth mindset , less attention and focus has been given to teacher mindsets and the role they play in influencing their students in particular , a study by rhew , piro , goolkasian & cosentino ( 2018 ) , suggested that a growth mindset intervention can increase the motivation levels of adolescent special education participants people with a '' fixed mindset '' believe that abilities are mostly innate and interpret failure as the lack of necessary basic abilities , while those with a '' growth mindset '' believe that they can acquire any given ability provided they invest effort or study in addition to the field of cognitive psychology , the use of mindset is evident within the social sciences and several other fields ( e.g he recounts the example of american indians , who were meant to undergo a reeducation process meant to imbue a modern '' life-plan '' that aimed for a house and a richness expressed by a filled bank account in boaler 's ability and mathematics : the mindset revolution that is reshaping education , the author argues that fixed mindset beliefs lead to inequalities in education ; these findings partially explain low achievement and participation amongst minorities and female students mindset theory , as based on the cultural values defined by sagiv and schwarts , explains the nature , functions , and variables that make up the characteristics of personality according to dweck ( 2010 ) , '' praising students for the process they have engaged in—the effort they applied , the strategies they used , the choices they made , the persistence they displayed , and so on—yields more long-term benefits than telling them they are 'smart ' when they succeed '' buchanan argues '' creating cultures of contribution and everyday leadership could be one of the best points of leverage we have for simultaneously bringing out the best in people , organisations and the planet although most consider that this mindset usefully served to prevent an attack by either country , the assumptions underlying deterrence theory have made assessments of the efficacy of the cold war mindset a matter of some controversy a characteristic of this area of study , in all its various manifestations , is the fragment use of mindset throughout the academy ( e.g a second strategy to promote a growth-mindset culture in the classroom is to explicitly teach lessons related to what it means to adopt a growth mindset in short , philosophical stance codified in the mind , hence as mindset , lead to a climate that in turn causes values that lead to practice in multiple studies , dweck and her colleagues noted that alterations in mindset could be achieved through '' praising the process through which success was achieved '' , cimpian , a this study reinforces the bond between a teacher 's own beliefs and how they can strongly influence the mindset of his/her students ; therefore , further highlighting the need for proper teacher training in order for mindset initiatives within schools to be fully successful nevertheless , any discussion of mindset should include recognition concerning the numerous , varied , and growing number of mindsets and mindset theories that receive attention in multiple disciplines throughout the academy similar to the mbti , the mindscapes of maruyama seek to measure individuals on a scale of characteristics and placed into four categories of personalities that make up the population of the world dweck argues that the growth mindset '' will allow a person to live a less stressful and more successful life '' in order for students to effectively adopt a growth mindset , a classroom culture needs to be established that nurtures this type of thinking wellbeing relate to a person , group of people , the whole of humanity , other sentient beings such as animals , and/or planet earth one of the ways educators can do this is by creating a growth-mindset culture in their classroom that provides the right kind of praise and encouragement he argues that mindsets guide people 's thinking and behavior and play a key role in people 's life experiences , development journey , and wellbeing in recent years , there has been criticism leveraged at '' growth mindset '' as a concept , and the related research that has been carried out a large part of dweck 's research on mindsets has been done in the field of education , and how these mindsets affect a student 's performance in the classroom
