the condensate and the injected water was then removed by the air pump , and the surrounding cold water served to absorb the remaining thermal energy to retain a condenser temperature of 30 & nbsp ; °c to 45 & nbsp ; °c and the equivalent pressure of 0.04 to 0.1 bar at each stroke the warm condensate was drawn off from the condenser and sent to a hot well by a vacuum pump , which also helped to evacuate the steam from under the power cylinder the condenser being at a lower pressure , drew the steam from the cylinder into the condenser where it cooled and condensed from water vapor to liquid water , maintaining a partial vacuum in the condenser that was communicated to the space of the cylinder by the connecting passage his most notable measuring device , still in use today , is the watt indicator incorporating a manometer to measure steam pressure within the cylinder according to the position of the piston , enabling a diagram to be produced representing the pressure of the steam as a function of its volume throughout the cycle the simplest solution to transforming the action of the beam into a rotating motion was to connect the beam to a wheel by a crank , but because another party had patent rights on the use of the crank , watt was obliged to come up with another solution these improvements allowed the steam engine to replace the water wheel and horses as the main sources of power for british industry , thereby freeing it from geographical constraints and becoming one of the main drivers in the industrial revolution the piston , attached to a chain and in turn attached to one end of the '' rocking beam '' , pulled down the end of the beam , lifting the opposite end of the beam before the development of the double acting piston , the linkage to the beam and the piston rod had been by means of a chain , which meant that power could only be applied in one direction , by pulling furthermore , it was not possible to connect the piston rod of the sealed cylinder directly to the beam , because while the rod moved vertically in a straight line , the beam was pivoted at its centre , with each side inscribing an arc the museum also holds an original boulton and watt atmospheric pump engine , originally used for canal pumping in birmingham , illustrated below , and in use in situ at the bowyer street pumping station from 1796 until 1854 , and afterwards removed to dearborn in 1929 watt had tried unsuccessfully for several years to obtain an accurately bored cylinder for his steam engines , and was forced to use hammered iron , which was out of round and caused leakage past the piston in 1775 , watt designed two large engines : one for the bloomfield colliery at tipton , completed in march 1776 , and one for john wilkinson 's ironworks at broseley in shropshire , which was at work the following month at the top of the stroke the steam valve was closed , and cold water was briefly injected into the cylinder as a means of cooling the steam having the beam connected to the piston shaft by a means that applied force alternately in both directions also meant that it was possible to use the motion of the beam to turn a wheel the greater fuel efficiency of their engines meant that they were most attractive in areas where fuel was expensive , particularly cornwall , for which three engines were ordered in 1777 , for the wheal busy , ting tang , and chacewater mines the separation of the cylinder and condenser eliminated the loss of heat that occurred when steam was condensed in the working cylinder of a newcomen engine this was effective in engines that were used for pumping water , but the double action of the piston meant that it could push as well as pull this gave the watt engine greater efficiency than the newcomen engine , reducing the amount of coal consumed while doing the same amount of work as a newcomen engine the main wheel attached to the crank was large and heavy , serving as a flywheel which , once set in motion , by its momentum maintained a constant power and smoothed the action of the alternating strokes the first watt engines were atmospheric pressure engines , like the newcomen engine but with the condensation taking place separate from the cylinder when the piston reached the top of the cylinder , the steam inlet valve closed and the valve controlling the passage to the condenser opened the volume of water entering the condenser as spray absorbed the latent heat of the steam , and was determined as seven times the volume of the condensed steam the system of alternately sending jets of steam , then cold water into the cylinder meant that the walls of the cylinder were alternately heated , then cooled with each stroke in 1698 , the english mechanical designer thomas savery invented a pumping appliance that used steam to draw water directly from a well by means of a vacuum created by condensing steam in 1763 , james watt was working as instrument maker at the university of glasgow when he was assigned the job of repairing a model newcomen engine and noted how inefficient it was the oldest working engine in the world is the smethwick engine , brought into service in may 1779 and now at thinktank in birmingham ( formerly at the now defunct museum of science and industry , birmingham ) james watt : monopolist he adopted the epicyclic sun and planet gear system suggested by an employee william murdoch , only later reverting , once the patent rights had expired , to the more familiar crank seen on most engines today watt 's next improvement to the newcomen design was to seal the top of the cylinder and surround the cylinder with a jacket
