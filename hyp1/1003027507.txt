helped by his schoolfriend cammarotta-adornoin , coandă started to build his slender sesquiplane and the unusual powerplant in a workshop in the courtyard of his house where he tested the thrust of the powerplant on a dynamometer , tests which are described in detail in the april 1910 edition of la technique aéronautique together with henri fabre 's hydravion , the first floatplane , coandă 's aircraft and devices used for aerodynamic experiments were placed '' in solitary state '' in an upstairs gallery , separated from the more usual types of aircraft on the main exhibition floor instead of a propeller , a 50 & nbsp ; hp ( 37 & nbsp ; kw ) inline water-cooled internal combustion engine built by pierre clerget at the clément-bayard workshop with funding from l'aero-club de france , placed in the forward section of the fuselage drove a rotary compressor through a 1:4 gearbox ( 1,000 & nbsp ; rpm on the clerget turned the compressor at 4,000 & nbsp ; rpm ) , which drew air in from the front and expelled it rearward under compression and with added heat '' the project that he arrived by departing from this above-mentioned concept represents a propulsion assembly for aeroplanes , with a jet effect , comprising a radial compressor powered by an internal combustion engine by means of a rotation multiplier with ratio of 1:4 , an assembly that formed a '' motorfan '' , the ancestor of the current turbofan '' the writer said the turbo-propulseur was '' claimed to give an enormous wind velocity '' , but the intake area seemed too small to produce the stated thrust , and that '' it also appears as if enormous power would be necessary to drive it '' , more than supplied by the clerget a daily newspaper from bucharest wrote in 1910 that the aircraft was constructed in clerget 's workshops and that it '' will fly in 6–7 weeks near paris , piloted by weymann , one of the pilots celebrated at the rennes aviation meeting '' the article coandă 's new aeroplane published by a daily bucharest newspaper in 1910 , provides us with some important information : the aeroplane that received much praise in parisian newspapers was built in the workshops of clergét company in paris , a company well known for the construction of aeroplane engines a group of modern-day romanian investigators led by dan antoniu , having examined photographs from 1910 , concluded that the rotary compressor featured at the exhibition was a hybrid between the one described in the initial 30 may 1910 patent and that shown in a later patent application '' according to gérard hartmann in his dossiers historiques et techniques aéronautique française , the propulsion system generated only of thrust , and to generate enough thrust for the aircraft to take off ( estimated by coandă at coandă would have had to spin the '' turbine '' ( the rotary compressor ) at a speed of 7,000 & nbsp ; rpm with the risk of it exploding he wrote that coandă answered his '' pressing—and indiscreet—questions '' about the turbo-propulseur-powered aircraft at that earlier exhibit , telling him that the machine had attained a speed of 112 & nbsp ; kilometres per hour ( 70 & nbsp ; mph ) during several '' flight tests '' , an improbable answer about which mirguet '' reserved judgment '' , waiting for confirmation that never materialised '' with the help of despujols , a boat maker , and the motor manufacturer gregoire , coandă supervised the building of a motor sled , powered by a 30 & nbsp ; hp ( 22 & nbsp ; kw ) gregoire engine driving the turbo-propulseur stimulated by an eventual deal with the french government , coandă completed the project of a flying machine derived from the coandă no.1 of 1910 , as well as his latest projects protected by patents , which he modified as a result of the user 's demands '' at the third aviation salon in paris 1911 , coandă displayed a scale model of the aircraft which used two gnome rotary engines mounted back to back , connected by a bevel gear to a single two-bladed propeller '' henri mirguet writing for l'aérophile magazine in january 1912 said that the new 1911 aircraft retained the fuselage , the frame and the wing of coandă 's 1910 design , but did not keep the turbo-propulseur or '' the wooden wingloading surface including the forward longitudinal ribs '' at the military competition in reims in october 1911 , coandă displayed a large parasol wing with a wingspan , powered by two gnome rotary engines mounted laterally driving a single four-bladed propeller through an engine-coupling system also designed by coandă a once-classified guggenheim aeronautical laboratory and jet propulsion laboratory study completed in 1946 described the coandă-1910 as '' probably not flown '' but featuring '' a mechanical jet propulsion device with a centrifugal blower '' , one in which heat from the clerget piston engine '' furnished auxiliary jet propulsion in 1953 , flights treatment of aircraft in the 50 years since the wright brothers ' flight included the coandă-1910 '' ducted fan '' and said of coandă that he '' believes that he 'took off for a few feet , then came down hurriedly and broke two teeth , quoting j.w in the early 1950s coandă began to claim that he had flown his 1910 aircraft himself , and that the 1910 engine was the first motorjet , using fuel injection and combustion to create its thrust in 1956 henri coandă described the trials with this coandă no.1 , 1910 machine on the military grounds of issy-les-moulineaux near paris : '' i wanted to make an attempt and then there was no one to teach us , we had to learn by ourselves coandă himself spoke on the subject , notably before the wings club at new york 's biltmore hotel on 18 january 1956 where he said '' i intended to inject fuel into the air stream which would be ignited by the exhaust gases also channelled through the same circular vent '' , implying that he never finished the powerplant for his article '' he flew in 1910 '' , rené aubrey interviewed coandă and wrote a contradictory story in the september 1956 royal air force flying review , saying that coandă had flown his unusual aircraft on 16 december 1910 , that fuel was certainly injected , and that it was '' the first jet flight in the world '' aubrey wrote that the aircraft engine was '' designed by a friend to coandă 's specification '' , and that its burning exhaust was '' directed below and to each side of the fuselage , which was protected by asbestos in vulnerable places he submitted the same text that caidin had written for flying in may : a collection of aviation stories was published in 1957 by major victor houart , a friend of coandă 's , who wrote that he was an eyewitness the day coandă flew and crashed one chapter of the book describes how houart , together with a group of french dragoons , watched as coandă taxied twice around the airfield , lifted off to avoid the ruins of an old fortification wall , started flames from the engine by applying too much power , and was thrown from the aircraft the moment it hit the wall , with coandă '' not badly hurt '' in further statements , coandă said that his 1910 aircraft had movable leading edge slots , the leading edge slot was patented by handley page in 1920 retractable landing gear and a fuel supply which was held in the overhead wing to reduce fuselage profile and thus drag stine wrote that coandă flew on 10 december 1910 , and described the heat from the '' two jet exhausts '' as being '' too much for me '' after the powerplant was mounted in the aircraft stine 's recounting of the 10 december flight included the group of eyewitness french dragoons , asbestos heat shields and metal deflector plates aft of the engine , intended taxiing with unintentional flight , a steep climb with a stall , coandă thrown clear , and the aircraft crashing to the ground , burning stine gave his assessment that '' coanda 's turbopropulseur had elements of a true jet '' , but that the patent application had no indication of the '' critical stage—injection of fuel into the compressed air '' he wrote that '' although there were several jet-propelled aircraft in existence at an early time—the 1910 coanda jet and the 1938 caproni campini n.1—the first pure jet aircraft flight was made in germany in 1938 '' garber of the nasm interviewed coandă , who related that the december 1910 flight was no accident , that he had seated himself in the cockpit intending to test five factors : aircraft structure , the engine , the wing lift , the balance of controls , and the aerodynamics '' in this interview coandă said that he brought the aircraft back to earth under control , but the landing was '' abrupt '' and he was thrown clear of the airframe which was consumed completely by flame , the engine reduced to '' a few handfuls of white powder '' he wrote that '' no claims that it flew , or was even tested , were made at the time '' , and that the story of it flying suddenly appeared in the 1950s —the aircraft was thus '' disinterred from its obscurity he said that the airfield was the '' most famous , most used , most observed , and most reported-on 'airfield ' in paris '' , and that all events , let alone an exciting crash and destruction by fire , would have been carried in local papers and described in military reports , but no contemporary accounts exist of the coandă-1910 being tested , flown or destroyed gibbs-smith countered the coandă assertions point by point , saying that the aircraft did not have a retractable undercarriage , did not have leading or trailing edge wing slots , did not have a fuel tank overhead in the wing , and did not have fuel injected into any turbine in 1970 gibbs-smith wrote another account of the coanda-1910 , using much the same phrasing as in 1960 : in 2010 , antoniu wrote that he thought gibbs-smith speculated on the basis of the evidence of absence that the aircraft was never tested or flown , but that gibbs-smith did not find any concrete evidence to support his position antoniu also wrote that gibbs-smith did not check the french patents claimed by coandă in 1910 and 1911 , describing the retractable gear , leading edge wing slot and upper wing fuel tank , and that he did not see photographs from private collections demonstrating aspects about which he wrote winter examined the 1965 drawings and specifications coandă prepared while at huyck corporation and wrote an article about coandă 's claim : '' there is a wholly new description of the inner workings of the machine that does not occur in any of the accounts given in the 1910s and which defies all of the patent specifications '' he said coandă told various conflicting stories about his claimed 1910 flight , and that coandă produced a set of altered drawings as proof of his claims : in his article , winter wondered why coandă did not add the novel feature of fuel injection and air stream combustion to his may 1911 patent applications if that feature had been present during his supposed flying experience five months earlier rather , winter noted that the august 1910 patent filings in french were essentially the same as the may 1911 ones in english , and that all the descriptions were applicable to air or water flowing through the device , meaning that the patents could not possibly include fuel combustion in the jet stream winter found that camille ( or cosimo ) canovetti , an italian civil and aviation engineer , had been working on a turbo-propulseur-style aviation engine before coandă , and had attempted to show an aircraft with such an engine at the aviation exposition in milan in 1909 some acknowledge coandă as the discoverer of the coandă effect but give hans von ohain the honour of designing the first jet engine to power an aircraft in manned flight , and frank whittle the honour of completing and patenting the first jet engine capable of such flight boyne discusses coandă briefly in one of his books , the leading edge : '' professor henri coanda , whose scientific work was impeccable , designed and built a jet aircraft in 1910 ; it , like martin 's kitten the martin kf-1 biplane , was superbly built and technically advanced—and could not fly '' in a later magazine article sidebar , boyne described more details : '' romanian inventor henri coanda attempted to fly a primitive jet aircraft in 1910 , using a four-cylinder internal combustion engine to drive a compressor at 4,000 revolutions per minute '' in 1980 and 1993 , jane 's encyclopedia of aviation included an entry on the 1910 aircraft , calling it the '' coanda turbine '' and describing it as '' the world 's first jet-propelled aircraft to fly '' brown 's 1985 a history of aviation , tim brady , the dean of aviation at embry–riddle aeronautical university , wrote in 2000 : '' the development of the jet is , broadly , the story of three men : henri coanda , sir frank whittle , and pabst von ohain '' his description of coandă 's disputed test flight agreed that fuel injection and combustion had been initiated in the rotary compressor 's vent , with the novel detail that the aircraft '' flew for about a thousand feet 300 & nbsp ; m before crashing into a wall in 1990 at the 24th symposium of the international academy of astronautics , one of the papers presented included this sentence : '' it is to henri coanda ( 1886–1972 ) , a world famous inventor and pioneer of jet flight , that space engineering owes—beside one of the first model planes provided with a rocket engine ( 1905 ) —the construction and engine experiment of the first jet aircraft , the 'coanda-1910 ' '' in 2007 in his popular book extreme aircraft , ron miller wrote that the powerplant in the coandă-1910 was one of the '' earliest attempts '' at a jet engine , but was unsuccessful—it was '' incapable of actual flight '' , unlike the engines designed by whittle and ohain '' in the 2000s , dan antoniu and other romanian aviation experts investigated existing photographs of the coandă-1910 , leading them to believe that the aircraft presented at the exhibition was not finished , that it was exhibited with many improvisations antoniu published henri coandă and his technical work during 1906–1918 , a 2010 book in which he said that the unfinished state of the aircraft led to coandă filing several extra patents and starting a new series of studies with the aim of making the machine airworthy by studying the existing photos , we can notice that the openings for the discharge of hot gases from the cylinders of the internal combustion engine were free , and were not fitted with any eventual devices directing gases along the fuselage in order to protect the crew
