when ska band the skatalites disbanded ( 64/65—accounts vary ) mccook went to work at the treasure isle label and jackie mittoo went to the studio one label—these two artists/arrangers became instrumental in the way these two labels became dominant and helped to form the sound of rocksteady also , in the middle to later part of the decade , as ska began to fade in popularity and the optimism that accompanied independence in 1962 dwindled , young people from the jamaican countryside were flooding into the urban ghettos of kingston—in neighborhoods such as riverton city , greenwich town and trenchtown the slowing that occurred with rocksteady allowed bass players to explore more broken , syncopated figures , playing a counterpoint to the repetitive rhythm of the guitar and keyboards and this new style eventually largely replaced the walking patterns that had been so characteristic of many ska recordings also around this time ( 1969–70 ) the use of a vocal-free or lead instrument-free dub or b-side '' version '' became popular in jamaica ; at the beginning this involved the use of rocksteady tracks , most notably with u-roy deejaying over treasure isle rhythms ( made by a young osbourne ruddock , later known as king tubby , beginning with '' wake the town '' ) perhaps rocksteady ’ s most easily recognizable element , and that which could be considered reggae music 's gift to the world , as in ska , is an offbeat rhythm : staccato chords played by a guitar and piano on the offbeats of the measure , junior byles came from the versatiles , john holt was in the paragons , both pat kelly and slim smith sang with the techniques ( pat kelly sings lead on '' you do n't care '' ) and ronnie davis was in the tennors while winston jarrett was in the righteous flames crying was a theme in some rocksteady songs , such as alton and the flames ' '' cry tough '' , which urged jamaicans in the ghettos to stay tough through the hard times such as the rhythm from '' never let go '' by slim smith ( sometimes known as the answer rhythm ) and “ real rock ” both from the studio one label ; “ my conversation ” also sung by slim smith , produced by bunny lee ; “ queen majesty ” sung by the techniques and “ lonely street ” by the conquerors , both for treasure isle label the record producer duke reid released alton ellis ' '' girl i 've got a date '' on his treasure isle label , as well as recordings by the techniques , the silvertones , the jamaicans and the paragons rocksteady coincided with the rise of rude boys and some rocksteady songs reflect this ( usually negatively ) such as '' rude boy gone a jail '' by the clarendonians and , most famously , “ judge dread ” by prince buster
