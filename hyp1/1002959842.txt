encouraged by physicist arago , arago summary director of the paris observatory , le verrier was intensely engaged for months in complex calculations to explain small but systematic discrepancies between uranus 's observed orbit and the one predicted from the laws of gravity of newton the letter arrived five days later , and the planet was found with the berlin fraunhofer refractor that same evening , 23 september 1846 , by galle and heinrich d'arrest within 1° of the predicted location near the boundary between capricorn and aquarius le verrier 's most famous achievement is his prediction of the existence of the then unknown planet neptune , using only mathematics and astronomical observations of the known planet uranus in 1846 , le verrier became a member of the french academy of sciences , and in 1855 , he was elected a foreign member of the royal swedish academy of sciences gold medal of the royal astronomical society – 1868 and 1876 namesake of craters on the moon and mars , a ring of neptune , and the asteroid 1997 leverrier one of the 72 names on the eiffel tower ) the success of the search for neptune based on its perturbations of the orbit of uranus led astronomers to place some faith in this possible explanation , and the hypothetical planet was even named vulcan le verrier 's first work in astronomy was presented to the académie des sciences in september 1839 , entitled sur les variations séculaires des orbites des planètes ( on the secular variations of the orbits of the planets ) le verrier published , in the annales de l'observatoire de paris , tables of the motions of all of the known planets , releasing them as he completed them , starting in 1858 adams made full public acknowledgement of le verrier 's priority and credit ( not forgetting to mention the role of galle ) when he gave his paper to the royal astronomical society in november 1846 : le verrier began studying the motion of mercury as early as 1843 , with a report entitled détermination nouvelle de l ’ orbite de mercure et de ses perturbations ( a new determination of the orbit of mercury and its perturbations ) in 1859 , le verrier was the first to report that the slow precession of mercury ’ s orbit around the sun could not be completely explained by newtonian mechanics and perturbations by the known planets
