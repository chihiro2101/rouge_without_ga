as a result , the majority of jamaicans can read and write standard english only , and have trouble deciphering written patois ( in which the writer tries to reflect characteristic structures and pronunciations to differing degrees , without compromising readability ) while , for the sake of simplicity , it is customary to describe jamaican speech in terms of standard english versus jamaican creole , a clear-cut dichotomy does not adequately describe the actual language use of most jamaicans most creole-dominant speakers have a fair command of english and standard english , through schooling and exposure to official culture and mass media ; their receptive skills ( understanding of standard english ) are typically much better than their productive skills ( their own intended standard english statements often show signs of jamaican creole interference ) jamaican standard english is a variety of international standard english ( see english language in england ) sometimes , jamaican english is perceived as maintaining less of a contrast between stress ( linguistics ) , in other words , making all syllables sound relatively-equally stressed : thus kitchen not so much as ( perhaps even perceived by a non-caribbean as having second-syllable stress : as jamaican standard english is often conflated with the british standard dialect , there are great similarities between grammar , idiom , and vocabulary merger of the diphthongs in '' fair '' and '' fear '' takes place both in jamaican standard english and jamaican patois , resulting in those two words ( and many others , like '' bear '' and '' beer '' ) often becoming homophones : the sound being , though often ( something like '' ee-air '' ; thus '' bear/beer '' as '' bee-air '' ) both and use a rounded , though a cot-caught merger is theoretically avoided by the latter set of words being more lengthened ; however , in reality , a full merger ( of is reportedly increasing in informal contexts the least prestigious ( most creole ) variety is called the basilect ; standard english ( or high prestige ) variety , the acrolect ; and in-between versions are known as mesolects this situation typically results when a creole language is in constant contact with standardised english ( superstrate or lexifier language ) and is called a creole speech continuum in jamaican english , normally reduced english vowels are sometimes not reduced , and other times are hyper-reduced , so that token is not but , yet cement can be as reduced as ; the exact nuances of the rules at play here are also highly debated standard english , on the other hand , is the language of education , high culture , government , the media and official/formal communications jamaican ( creole/patois ) is used by most people for everyday , informal situations - it is the language most jamaicans use at home and are most familiar with , as well as the language of most local popular music a creole-dominant speaker will choose a higher variety for formal occasions like official business or a wedding speech , and a lower one for relating to friends ; a standard english-dominant speaker is likely to employ a lower variety when shopping at the market than at their workplace it is also the native language of a small minority of jamaicans ( typically upper-class and upper/traditional middle-class ) '' ( acrolect ) ( as noted above , the '' r '' in '' over '' is not pronounced in any variety , but the one in '' dere '' or '' there '' is features include the characteristic pronunciation of the diphthong in words like , which is often more closed and rounded than in received pronunciation or general american ; the pronunciation of the vowel to ( again , more closed and rounded than the british received pronunciation or general american varieties ) ; and the very unusual feature of '' variable semi-rhoticity '' jamaican patois has a standardised orthography , dynamics of orthographic standardisation in jamaican creole and nigerian pidgin , dagmar deuber and lars hinrichs , world englishes 26 , no between the two extremes— '' broad patois '' on one end of the spectrum , and '' perfect '' standard english on the other—there are various in-between varieties
