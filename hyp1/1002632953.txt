in 1951 franklin moss , then the president of the mosstype corporation , conducted a poll among the readers of his journal the mosstyper to submit new names for the printing process since 1990 , great advances have been made to the quality of flexographic printing presses , printing plates , ink systems and printing inks the greatest advances in flexographic printing have been in the area of photopolymer printing plates , including improvements to the plate material and the method of plate creation full-color picture printing is now possible , and some of the finer presses available today , in combination with a skilled operator , allow quality that rivals the lithography process the process can differ depending on whether solid sheets of photopolymer or liquid photopolymer are used , but the principle is still the same the plate is washed out in a mixture of water and 1 % dishwasher soap , at a temperature of approximately 40 & nbsp ; °c after addition of absorb gelatine for example , the photopolymer residue can be disposed of as standard solid waste together with household refuse companies such as av flexologic , glunz & jensen , xeikon , esko , kodak , polymount , screen and spgprints from the netherlands are market leaders in manufacturing this type of equipment the first step is to create a metal plate out of the negative of our initial image through an exposition process ( followed by an acid bath ) this metal plate in relief is then used in the second step to create the mold that could be in bakelite board or even glass or plastic , through a first molding process once cooled , this master mold will press the rubber or plastic compound ( under both controlled temperature and pressure ) through a second molding process to create the printing plate or cliche mounting for every colour to be printed , a plate is made and eventually put on a cylinder which is placed in the printing press to make a complete picture , regardless of printing on flexible film or corrugated paper , the image transferred from each plate has to register exactly with the images transferred from the other colors generally plates are mounted directly onto the print sleeve but for corrugated operations , plates are mounted onto a carrier sheet that is fixed to the print sleeve in the press when required , it is removed and kept in storage between print runs types of registration marks these are various types of mark used for aligning the plates correctly : registration crosses are commonly used but need to be positioned in waste areas as they are easily seen on the print , they can also be used as a guide for aligning the print to a bag or box structure if this is required micro dots as the name suggests are tiny dots on the plate , usually about a quarter of a millimeter across in labels and flexible packaging but 1mm diameter in corrugated register crosses are more common in label and corrugated printing where waste and hidden folds are normal , the microdot is common in flexible packaging where waste is kept to a minimum and no un-required marks are to be seen on the packaging ( example meat , dairy and hygiene ) it is also recommended to have two more pairs , one at either end so a simple rotation and check under the cameras confirms the plate has not twisted when it was laid/stuck down the high magnification video cameras ( positioned on a precision machined camera beam ) are moved into the required position for the plate to be mounted , accurate measurement of this setting is critical each plate is mounted on a double sided adhesive tape - there are many types of mounting tape and it is important to use the correct thickness and hardness adhesive type also needs to be correct for your mounting process ( see tape features ) the tape is applied to the sleeve being careful to lay it on without trapping air underneath it ( must be flat to sleeve ) these include tables to lay the plate on to make maneuvering the plate into position simpler , lay down ( pressure ) rollers to eliminate air bubble inclusions , tape application options , plate and tape cutting options and moving cameras , replacing multiple camera mounting systems printing a flexographic print is made by creating a positive mirrored master of the required image as a 3d relief in a rubber or polymer material then it transfers to the anilox or ceramic roll ( or meter roll ) whose texture holds a specific amount of ink since it is covered with thousands of small wells or cups that enable it to meter ink to the printing plate in a uniform thickness evenly and quickly ( the number of cells per linear inch can vary according to the type of print job and the quality required ) international paper - knowledge center - flexography : to avoid getting a final product with a smudgy or lumpy look , it must be ensured that the amount of ink on the printing plate is not excessive if a uv curing ink is used , the sheet does not have to be dried , but the ink is cured by uv rays instead in modern flexographic printing , the anilox roll is referred to as a type of meter or metering roller doctor blade ( optional ) an optional doctor blade scrapes the anilox roll to ensure that the ink to be delivered to the flexible printing plate is only what is contained within the engraved cells there are five types of inks that can be used in flexography : solvent-based inks water-based inks electron beam ( eb ) curing inks ultraviolet ( uv ) curing inks two-part chemically-curing inks ( usually based on polyurethane isocyanate reactions ) - although these are uncommon at the moment water based flexo inks with particle sizes below 5 & nbsp ; µm may cause problems when deinking recycled paper flexo has an advantage over lithography in that it can use a wider range of inks , water based rather than oil based inks , and is good at printing on a variety of different materials like plastic , foil , acetate film , brown paper , and other materials used in packaging typical products printed using flexography include brown corrugated boxes , flexible packaging including retail and shopping bags , food and hygiene bags and sacks , milk and beverage cartons , flexible plastics , self-adhesive labels , disposable cups and containers , envelopes and wallpaper flexo printing is widely used in the converting industry for printing plastic materials for packaging and other end uses
