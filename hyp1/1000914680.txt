in popular usage , southern min usually refers to dialects of the hokkien type , which originated in southern fujian ( around quanzhou , zhangzhou and xiamen ) and spread to southeast asia , where they are known as hokkien , and taiwan , where they are known as taiwanese the coastal varieties have the vast majority of speakers , and have spread from their homeland in fujian and eastern guangdong to the islands of taiwan and hainan , to other coastal areas of southern china and to southeast asia as a result , whereas most varieties of chinese can be treated as derived from middle chinese , the language described by rime dictionary such as the qieyun ( 601 ad ) , min varieties contain traces of older distinctions the language atlas of china ( 1987 ) included a further group : shao-jiang min , spoken in the northwestern fujian counties of shaowu and jiangle , were classified as hakka by pan and his associates in the case of taiwanese , there are also indigenous words borrowed from formosan languages ( particularly for place names ) , as well as a substantial number of loan words from japanese pan and colleagues divided them into three groups : eastern min ( min dong ) , centered around the city of fuzhou , the capital of fujian province , with fuzhou dialect as the prestige form a key discriminator between the two groups is a group of words that have a lateral initial in coastal varieties , and a voiceless fricative or in inland varieties , contrasting with another group having in both areas however , significant waves of migration from the north china plain occurred : the uprising of the five barbarians during the jin dynasty , particularly the disaster of yongjia in 311 ad , caused a tide of immigration to the south most min vocabulary corresponds directly to cognates in other chinese varieties , but there is also a significant number of distinctively min words that may be traced back to proto-min the language atlas of china ( 1987 ) distinguished two further groups , which had previously been included in southern min : leizhou min , spoken on the leizhou peninsula in southwestern guangdong li rulong and chen zhangtai examined 214 words , finding 62 % shared with quanzhou dialect ( southern min ) and 39 % shared with fuzhou dialect ( eastern min ) , and concluded that pu-xian was more closely related to southern min contrary to popular belief , a vernacular written in this fashion is not in general comprehensible to a mandarin speaker , due to significant changes in grammar and vocabulary and the necessary use of large number of non-mandarin characters given that min combines the chinese of several different periods and contains some non-chinese substrate vocabulary , an author literate in mandarin ( or even classical chinese ) may have trouble finding the appropriate chinese characters for some min vocabulary pan and colleagues divided the inland varieties into two groups : northern min ( min bei ) is spoken in nanping prefecture in fujian , with jian'ou dialect taken as typical in 909 , following the fall of the tang dynasty , his son wang shenzhi founded the min kingdom , one of the ten kingdoms in the five dynasties and ten kingdoms period most subsequent migration from north to south china passed through the valleys of the xiang and gan rivers to the west , so that min varieties have experienced less northern influence than other southern groups
