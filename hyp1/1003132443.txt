the work was composed after diabelli , a well-known music publisher and composer , in the early part of 1819 sent a waltz of his creation to all the important composers of the austrian empire , including franz schubert , carl czerny , johann nepomuk hummel , and the archduke rudolph , asking each of them to write a variation on it about a slightly earlier period , 1815 , beethoven 's authoritative biographer , alexander wheelock thayer , writes , '' diabelli , born near salzburg in 1781 , had now been for some years one of the more prolific composers of light and pleasing music , and one of the best and most popular teachers in vienna '' at the time of his project for variations on a theme of his own by various composers , diabelli had advanced to become a partner in the publishing firm of cappi and diabelli the oft-told but now questionable story of the origins of this work is that beethoven at first refused categorically to participate in diabelli 's project , dismissing the theme as banal , a schusterfleck or 'cobbler 's patch , ' unworthy of his time czerny , carl , '' on the proper performance of all beethoven 's works for the piano : edited and with a commentary by paul badura-skoda '' , universal editions , 1970 , p 1 ( the opening march ) , 2 , 15 , 23 ( sometimes called a parody of a cramer finger exercise ) , 24 ( a lyrical fughetta ) , 25 , 26 , 28 , 29 ( the first of the series of three slow variations leading to the final fugue and minuet ) , 31 ( the third , highly expressive slow variation leading directly into the final fugue and minuet ) and 33 ( the concluding minuet ) one suggestion on what prompted beethoven to write a set of '' grand variations '' on diabelli 's theme is the influence of the archduke rudolph who , in the previous year , under beethoven 's tutelage , had composed a huge set of forty variations on a theme by beethoven he might have been trying to outdo himself after his 32 variations in c & nbsp ; minor , or trying to outdo bach 's goldberg variations with its total of thirty-two pieces ( two presentations of the theme and thirty variations ) '' alfred brendel observes , '' in beethoven 's own pianistic output , the figures 32 and 33 have their special significance : 32 sonatas are followed by 33 variations as a crowning achievement , of which var tovey comments : brendel 's title for this variation is to mozart ; to beethoven explaining : solomon describes the closing bars as '' the final image â€“ of a tender , songful , profound nostalgia , a vantage point from which we can review the purposes of the entire journey while it can be a simple , unimaginative device , the grove dictionary of music points out that the rosalia has been used effectively by great composers , as in handel 's hallelujah chorus in the messiah ( '' king of kings '' ) , the first movement of mozart 's jupiter symphony and the finale of mozart 's string quartet k.575
