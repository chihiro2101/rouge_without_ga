supposed objectivity of interpretation writing in 1987 , the archaeologist christopher chippindale of cambridge university spoke on the view of processualism at that time , putting it in the context of the 1960s , when he stated that : : the sharper students of the current generation reasonably regard the '' new archaeology '' in its pristine form as a period piece , as strange an artefact of that remote era as the paris évènements or woodstock they have some cause : the then-radical insistence that nothing valuable had been written in archaeology before 1960 matched the hippie belief that anyone over 30 was too ancient to be intelligent , and the optimism that anything could be recovered from the archaeological record if only you searched hard enough was the archaeological version of the hope that the pentagon could be levitated if only enough people had sufficient faith in 1973 , the processualist david clarke of cambridge university would publish an academic paper in antiquity claiming that as a discipline , archaeology had moved from its original '' noble innocence '' through to '' self-consciousness '' and then onto '' critical self-consciousness '' , a symptom of which was the development of the new archaeology there was such a dearth of work in this area that it led willey and phillips to state in 1958 , '' so little work has been done in american archaeology on the explanatory level that it is difficult to find a name for it '' watson 1991:267 the new methodological approaches of the processual research paradigm include logical positivism ( the idea that all aspects of culture are accessible through the material record ) , the use of quantitative data , and the hypothetico-deductive model ( scientific method of observation and hypothesis testing ) trigger , 1989:289 what this all means to processual archaeologists is that cultural changes are driven by evolutionary '' processes '' in cultural development , which will be adaptive relative to the environment and therefore not only understandable , but also scientifically predictable once the interaction of the variables is understood binford wanted to prove that the mousterian assemblage , a group of stone artifacts from france during the ice age , was adapted to its environment , and so binford spent time with the nunamiut of alaska , a people living in conditions very similar to those of france during the period in question in his 2010 book on archaeological theory , matthew johnson- then of the university of southampton , now at northwestern university- argued that despite the intervening 40 years since its development , the '' intellectual questions '' first posed by processualism remained '' absolutely central '' to archaeology clarke 's paper would later be described as '' one of the seminal statements of the new archaeology , by one of its leading proponents '' in britain , if not elsewhere , by the archaeologists caroline malone and simon stoddart as an instance , in the field of paleolinguistics , colin renfrew , in re-examining proto-indo-european language and making a case for the spread of indo-european languages through neolithic europe in connection with the spread of farming , renfrew 1987 the question of where to put archaeology as a discipline , and its concomitant issues of what archaeology ought to study and which methods it ought to use , likely played no small part in the emergence of post-processualism in europe the goddess and the bull : catalhoyuk , an archaeological journey to the dawn of civilization ( 2005 ) for a detailed account of the debate between the processual and post-processual schools of archaeology . trigger , 1989:295 methodologically , the advocates of the new archaeology had to come up with ways of analyzing the archaeological remains in a more scientific fashion as a result , he argued , archaeology had suffered a '' loss of innocence '' as archaeologists became sceptical of the work of their forebears
