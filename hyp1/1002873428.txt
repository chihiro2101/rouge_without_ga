during world war i , the french army was the first to employ tear gas , using 26 & nbsp ; mm grenades filled with ethyl bromoacetate in august 1914 none of the combatants considered the use of tear gas to be in conflict with the hague treaty of 1899 , which specifically prohibited the launching of projectiles containing asphyxiating or poisonous gas the first instance of large-scale use of gas as a weapon was on 31 january 1915 , when germany fired 18,000 artillery shells containing liquid xylyl bromide tear gas on russian positions on the rawka river , west of warsaw during the battle of bolimov it may appear from a feldpost letter of major karl von zingler that the first chlorine gas attack by german forces took place before 2 january 1915 : '' in other war theatres it does not go better and it has been said that our chlorine is very effective this letter must be discounted as evidence for early german use of chlorine , however , because the date '' 2 january 1915 '' may have been hastily scribbled instead of the intended '' 2 january 1916 , '' the sort of common typographical error that is often made at the beginning of a new year the deaths of so many english officers from gas at this time would certainly have been met with outrage , but a recent , extensive study of british reactions to chemical warfare says nothing of this supposed attack at 17:30 , in a slight easterly breeze , the liquid chlorine was siphoned from the tanks , producing gas which formed a grey-green cloud that drifted across positions held by french colonial troops from martinique , as well as the 1st tirailleurs and the 2nd zouaves from algeria the german infantry were also wary of the gas and , lacking reinforcements , failed to exploit the break before the 1st canadian division and assorted french troops reformed the line in scattered , hastily prepared positions apart the british official history stated that at hill 60 , '' 90 men died from gas poisoning in the trenches or before they could be got to a dressing station ; of the 207 brought to the nearest dressing stations , 46 died almost immediately and 12 after long suffering it quickly became evident that the men who stayed in their places suffered less than those who ran away , as any movement worsened the effects of the gas , and that those who stood up on the fire step suffered less—indeed they often escaped any serious effects—than those who lay down or sat at the bottom of a trench it was water-soluble , so the simple expedient of covering the mouth and nose with a damp cloth was effective at reducing the effect of the gas it was thought to be even more effective to use urine rather than water , as it was known at the time that chlorine reacted with urea ( present in urine ) to form dichloro urea for example , see : chlorine required a concentration of 1,000 parts per million to be fatal , destroying tissue in the lungs , likely through the formation of hypochlorous and hydrochloric acids when dissolved in the water in the lungs by 6 july 1915 , the entire british army was equipped with the more effective '' hypo helmet '' designed by major cluny macpherson , newfoundland regiment , which was a flannel bag with a celluloid window , which entirely covered the head the race was then on between the introduction of new and more effective poison gases and the production of effective countermeasures , which marked gas warfare until the armistice in november 1918 in the years following world war one , there were many conferences held in attempts to abolish the use of chemical weapons all together , such as the washington naval conference ( 1921–22 ) , geneva conference ( 1923–25 ) and the world disarmament conference ( 1933 ) mary fox , frank curriero , kathryn kulbicki , beth resnick , thomas burke , '' evaluating the community health legacy of wwi chemical weapons testing , '' journal of community health , 35 , ( 18 november 2009 ) : 96
