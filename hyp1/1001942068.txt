) notably , this is the same phenomenon that occurs when muscle is poisoned by iodoacetate , a substance that blocks breakdown of glycogen into glucose and prevents the formation of lactate in some , the level is increased by multitudes - a person without gsd-v will have a ck between 60 and 400iu/l , while a person with the syndrome may have a level of 5,000 iu/l at rest , and may increase to 35,000 iu/l or more with muscle exertion lys-680 is involved in binding the pyridoxal phosphate , which is the active form of vitamin b6 , a cofactor required by myophosphorylase dna sequencing of the pygm gene ( which codes for the muscle isoform of glycogen phosphorylase ) may be done to determine the presence of mutation , determining if mcardle 's is present genereview/nih/uw entry on glycogen storage disease type v euromac , an eu-funded consortium of medical and research institutes across europe which is building a patient registry and raising standards of care for people with mcardle disease the gene for myophosphorylase , pygm ( the muscle-type of the glycogen phosphorylase gene ) , is located on chromosome 11q13 ( the ischemic exercise consists of the patient squeezing a hand dynamometer at maximal strength for a specific period of time , usually a minute , with a blood pressure cuff , which is placed on the upper arm and set at 250 mmhg , blocking blood flow to the exercising arm myoglobinuria may result from the breakdown of skeletal muscle known as rhabdomyolysis , a condition in which muscle cells breakdown , sending their contents into the bloodstream the deficiency was the first metabolic myopathy to be recognized , when dr this can help distinguish mcardle 's syndrome from carnitine palmitoyltransferase ii deficiency ( cpt-ii ) , a lipid-based metabolic disorder which prevents fatty acids from being transported into mitochondria for use as an energy source myophosphorylase is involved in the breakdown of glycogen to glucose for use in muscle for example , the r50x ( arg50stop ) mutation ( previously referred to as r49x ) is most common in north america and western europe , and the y84x mutation is most common among central europeans serum lactate may fail to rise in part because of increased uptake via the monocarboxylate transporter 1 , which is upregulated in skeletal muscle in mcardle disease
