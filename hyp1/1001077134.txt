he held that communication between jews and christians was not merely permissible , but '' desirable and even essential '' on non-theological issues such as war and peace , the war on poverty , the struggle for people to gain freedom , issues of morality and civil rights , and to work together against the perceived threat of secularism it is not easy to wipe out the memories of centuries of persecution and massacre , all too often dedicated to the advancement of the cause of the prince of peace.it is no easy task for jews to divest themselves of the heavy burden of group memories from the past , which are unfortunately reinforced all too often by personal experiences in the present there is need for jews to surrender the stereotype of christianity as being monolithic and unchanging and to recognize the ramifications of viewpoint and emphasis that constitute the multicolored spectrum of christian denominations gordis writes '' to describe judaism within the framework of the old testament is as misleading as constructing a picture of american life in terms of the constitution , which is , to be sure , the basic law of the land but far from coextensive with our present legal and social system in the second half of the twentieth century , no relationship between jews and christians can be dignified or honest without facing up frankly to the centuries of prejudice , theological anathema , and persecution that have been thrust upon jewish communities , culminating in the horrors of the shoah ( holocaust ) numbers rabbah 8:2 a traditional jewish view is that rather than being obligated to obey the whole 613 mitzvot that the jews are obligated to , the other nation adhere to a common list of commandments under seven categories that god required of the children of noah ; noahide laws , ( i.e maimonides believed that other monotheistic faiths , christianity and islam , serve to spread knowledge of , and devotion to , the god and the torah of israel throughout the world '' he calls on jews to understand with tolerance and respect the historical and religious context which led christians to develop the concepts of the virgin birth , the incarnation , the passion , and the resurrection , even if jews themselves do not accept these ideas as correct on august 31 , 2017 , representatives of the conference of european rabbis , the rabbinical council of america , and the commission of the chief rabbinate of israel issued and presented the holy see with a statement entitled between jerusalem and rome , muhammad who came after him , only served to clear the way for the jewish messiah to prepare the whole world to worship god with one accord , as it is written 'for then will i turn to the peoples a pure language , that they all call upon the name of the lord to serve him with one consent no relationship can be nurtured between jews and muslims unless it acknowledges explicitly and seeks to combat the terrible social and political effects of muslim hostility , as well as the disturbing but growing reaction of jewish anti-arabism in the land of israel he described the traditional jewish–christian relationship as one of '' the few and weak vis-à-vis the many and the strong '' , one in which the christian community historically denied the right of the jewish community to believe and live in their own way thus the jewish hope , and the torah , and the mitzvot have become familiar topics of conversation among those even on far isles , and among many people , uncircumcised of flesh and heart this view , however , did not preclude a belief that god has a relationship with other peoples rather , judaism held that god had entered into a covenant with all humankind , and that jews and non-jews alike have a relationship with god , each nation with its own unique relationship with god traditionally , jews believe that god chose the jewish people to be in a jews as a chosen people , described by the torah itself , with particular obligations and responsibilities elucidated in the oral torah some jews argue that god has a relationship with all gentile monotheists ( or perceived monotheists ) , including hindus , who in the past may have been ( mis ) interpreted as having a polytheist faith ( see also hindu views on monotheism ) , as well as with members of other religions such as buddhism but when the king of kings , the holy one , blessed be he , creates people in the form of adam not one is similar to any other press , 1961 , ch.10 ) maimonides , one of judaism 's most important theologians and halakha , explained in detail why jesus was wrong to create christianity and why muhammad was wrong to create islam ; he laments the pains jews have suffered in persecution from followers of these new faiths as they attempted to supplant judaism ( in the case of christianity , called supersessionism ) this official statement holds that : '' as conservative jews , we acknowledge without apology the many debts which jewish religion and civilization owe to the nations of the world in his view '' the language of faith of a particular community is totally incomprehensible to the man of a different faith community similarly , gordis calls on christians to understand with tolerance and respect that jews do not accept these beliefs , since they are in contradiction to the jewish understanding of the unity of god rather , judaism is based on the bible as understood through the classical works of rabbinic literature , such as the mishnah and talmud '' gordis calls on jews to '' see in christian doctrine an effort to apprehend the nature of the divine that is worthy of respect and understanding '' and that '' the dogmas of the christian church have expressed this vision of god in terms that have proved meaningful to christian believers through the centuries based on these statements , some rabbis theorized that , in the words of natan'el al-fayyumi , a yemenite jewish theologian of the 12th century , '' god permitted to every people something he forbade to others when the rav soloveitch was consulted he approved the topic and quipped , '' what should the topic have been ? man as a naturalistic creature ? ! '' : ( lawrence kaplan , revisionism and the rav : the struggle for the soul of modern orthodoxy judaism , summer , 1999 ) the basis for soloveitchik 's ruling was not narrowly legal , but sociological and historical : ( 2 ) he holds that christians should stop '' the widespread practice of contrasting the primitivism , tribalism and formalism of the old testament ( see also antinomianism ) with the spirituality , universalism , and freedom of the new , to the manifest disadvantage of the former biblical references as well as rabbinic literature support this view : moses refers to the '' god of the spirits of all flesh '' , and the tanakh ( hebrew bible ) also identifies prophets outside the community of israel the unprecedented orthodox rabbinic statement on christianity , entitled '' to do the will of our father in heaven : toward a partnership between jews and christians '' , was initially signed by over 25 prominent orthodox rabbis in israel , united states and europe and now has over 60 signatories as a result of his ruling , orthodox jewish groups did not operate in interfaith discussions between the roman catholic church and jews about vatican ii , a strictly theological endeavour many muslim and jewish groups and individuals have together created projects working for peace among israelis and arabs , most of which have as one of their goals overcoming religious prejudice maybe the greeks were chosen for their unique contributions to art and philosophy , the romans for their pioneering services in law and government , the british for bringing parliamentary rule into the world , and the americans for piloting democracy in a pluralistic society in contrast , some modern orthodox rabbis such as eugene korn and david hartman hold that in some cases , the primary issue in confrontation is no longer valid ; some christian groups no longer attempt to use interfaith dialogue to convert jews to christianity robert gordis held that '' a rational dialogue conducted on the basis of knowledge and mutual respect between the two components of the religio-ethical tradition of the western world can prove a blessing to our age
