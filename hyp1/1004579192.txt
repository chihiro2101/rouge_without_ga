also , because the central directory specifies the offset of each file in the archive with respect to the start , it is possible for the first file entry to start at an offset other than zero , although some tools , for example gzip , will not process archive files that do not start with a file entry at offset zero such an empty zip file contains only an end of central directory record ( eocd ) : 0x50,0x4b,0x05,0x06,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00 the maximum size for both the archive file and the individual files inside it is 4,294,967,295 bytes ( 2 32 −1 bytes , or 4 gib minus 1 byte ) for standard zip this property of the format , and of the jar format which is a variant of zip , can be exploited to hide rogue content ( such as harmful java classes ) inside a seemingly harmless file , such as a gif image uploaded to the web the file format allows for a comment containing up to 65,535 ( 2 16 −1 ) bytes of data to occur at the end of the file after the central directory self-extracting archives ( sfx ) , of the form supported by winzip , take advantage of this , in that they are executable files that conform to the pkzip appnote.txt specification , and can be read by compliant zip tools or libraries the theoretical maximum compression factor for a raw deflate stream is about 1032 to one , but by exploiting the zip format in unintended ways , zip archives with compression ratios of billions to one can be constructed the encryption standards themselves were not proprietary , but pkware had not updated appnote.txt to include strong encryption specification ( ses ) since 2001 , which had been used by pkzip versions 5.0 and 6.0 file format includes an extra field facility within file headers , which can be used to store extra data not defined by existing zip specifications , and which allow compliant archivers that do not recognize the fields to safely skip them the info-zip windows tools also support ntfs filesystem permissions , and will make an attempt to translate from ntfs permissions to unix permissions or vice versa when extracting files this allows arbitrary data to occur in the file both before and after the zip archive data , and for the archive to still be read by a zip application the free software project 7-zip also supports aes , but not ses in zip files ( as does its posix port p7zip )
