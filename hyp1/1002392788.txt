the most popular works by composers such as john williams are still far from entering the accepted classical canon , although there is a growing appreciation for the broader contribution of composers such as williams among some classical composers and critics ; for example , the norwegian contemporary classical composer marcus paus has said that he considers williams to be '' one of the great composers of any century '' who has '' found a very satisfying way of embodying dissonance and avant-garde techniques within a larger tonal framework '' and who '' might also have come the closest of any composer to realizing the old schoenbergian utopia that children of the future would be whistling 12-tone rows in 1983 , a non-profit organization , the the film music society , was formed to preserve the '' byproducts '' of creating a film score , including the music manuscripts ( written music ) and other documents and studio recordings generated in the process of composing and recording scores which , in some instances , have been discarded by movie studios the methods of writing the score vary from composer to composer ; some composers prefer to work with a traditional pencil and paper , writing notes by hand on a staff and performing works-in-progress for the director on a piano , while other composers write on computers using sophisticated scorewriter such as digital performer , logic pro , finale , cubase , or pro tools afi 's 100 years of film scores filmi , bollywood film music hollywood studio symphony , the trade name of contracted los angeles session musicians performing many post-2002 hollywood film scores list of film score composers list of film director and composer collaborations music of bollywood musivisual language sheet music theatre music score , a 2016 documentary film about film scores a film score can encompass literally thousands of different combinations of instruments , ranging from full symphony orchestral ensembles to single solo instruments to rock bands to jazz combos , along with a multitude of ethnic and world music influences , soloists , vocalists , choirs and electronic textures the composer usually enters the creative process towards the end of filming at around the same time as the film is being edited , although on some occasions the composer is on hand during the entire film shoot , especially when actors are required to perform with or be aware of original diegetic music in some circumstances , a composer will be asked to write music based on his or her impressions of the script or storyboards without seeing the film itself and is given more freedom to create music without the need to adhere to specific cue lengths or mirror the emotional arc of a particular scene other composers are less detailed , and will often ask orchestrators to '' fill in the blanks '' , providing their own creative input into the makeup of the ensemble , ensuring that each instrument is capable of performing the music as written , and even allowing them to introduce performance techniques and flourishes to enhance the score german cinema , which was highly influential in the era of silent movies , provided some original scores such as fritz lang 's movies die nibelungen ( 1924 ) and metropolis ( 1927 ) which were accompanied by original full scale orchestral and leitmotific scores written by gottfried huppertz , who also wrote piano-versions of his music , for playing in smaller cinemas the nature and level of orchestration varies from project to project and composer to composer , but in its basic form the orchestrator 's job is to take the single-line music written by the composer and '' flesh it out '' into instrument-specific sheet music for each member of the orchestra to perform '' source music '' ( or a '' source cue '' ) comes from an on screen source that can actually be seen or that can be inferred ( in academic film theory such music is called '' diegesis '' music , as it emanates from the '' diegesis '' or '' story world '' ) similarly , the relationship between director sergio leone and composer ennio morricone was such that the finale of the good , the bad and the ugly and the films once upon a time in the west and once upon a time in america were edited to morricone 's score as the composer had prepared it months before the film 's production ended the style of the music being written also varies massively from project to project , and can be influenced by the time period in which the film is set , the geographic location of the film 's action , and even the musical tastes of the characters as part of their preparations for writing the score the composer will often research different musical techniques and genres as appropriate for that specific project ; as such , it is not uncommon for established film composers to be proficient at writing music in dozens of different styles '' erik satie '' , royal opera house ( uk ) website , at anticipating '' spotting '' techniques and the inconsistencies of projection speeds in screenings of silent films , satie took precise timings for each sequence and created a flexible , aleatoric score of brief , evocative motifs which could be repeated and varied in tempo as required this approach is usually taken by a director who does not wish to have the music comment specifically on a particular scene or nuance of a film and which can instead be inserted into the film at any point the director wishes during the post-production process one of the most famous cases is stanley kubrick 's 2001 : a space odyssey , where kubrick opted for existing recordings of classical works , including pieces by composer györgy ligeti rather than the score by alex north , although kubrick had also hired frank cordell to do a score another notable example is jerry goldsmith 's klingon theme from star trek : the motion picture ( 1979 ) , which later composers in the star trek film series quoted in their klingon motifs , and which was included on numerous occasions as a theme for worf , the franchise 's most prominent klingon character one of the rare occasions on which music occurs in the movie is a song one of the characters sings , that lang uses to put emphasis on the man 's insanity , similar to the use of the whistling in m the orchestra performs in front of a large screen depicting the film , the conductor and musicians habitually wear headphones that sound a series of clicks called a '' click-track '' that changes with meter and tempo , assisting to synchronize the music with the film before the age of recorded sound in motion pictures , efforts were taken to provide suitable music for films , usually through the services of an in-house pianist or organist , and , in some cases , entire orchestras , typically given cue sheets as a guide musicians for these ensembles are often uncredited in the film or on the album and are contracted individually ( and if so , the orchestra contractor is credited in the film or the soundtrack album ) the length of time a composer has to write the score varies from project to project ; depending on the post-production schedule , a composer may have as little as two weeks or as much as three months to write the score the extra-terrestrial was edited to match the music of his long-time collaborator john williams : as recounted in a companion documentary on the dvd , spielberg gave williams complete freedom with the music and asked him to record the cue without picture ; spielberg then re-edited the scene later to match the music unlike popular and classical music publishers , who typically own less than 50 percent of the copyright in a composition , music production libraries own all of the copyrights of their music , meaning that it can be licensed without seeking the composer 's permission , as is necessary in licensing music from normal publishers the composer is shown an unpolished '' rough cut '' of the film before the editing is completed and talks to the director or producer about what sort of music is required for the film in terms of style and tone other examples of this include victor herbert 's score in 1915 to the fall of a nation ( a sequel to the birth of a nation ) and camille saint-saëns ' music for the assassination of the duke of guise in 1908 more rarely , the director will talk to the composer before shooting has started , so as to give more time to the composer or because the director needs to shoot scenes ( namely song or dance scenes ) according to the final score during this process , the composer will take precise timing notes so that he or she knows how long each cue needs to last , where it begins , where it ends , and of particular moments during a scene with which the music may need to coincide in a specific way george burt , the art of film music , northeastern university press on other occasions , directors have become so attached to the temp score that they decide to use it and reject the original score written by the film composer using a technique called free timing , a conductor will use either ( a ) a stopwatch or studio size stop clock , or ( b ) watch the film on a screen or video monitor while conducting the musicians to predetermined timings ;

examples of prominent film music orchestrators include pete anthony , jeff atmajian , brad dechter , bruce fowler , john neufeld , thomas pasatieri , conrad pope , nic raine and j.a.c in both instances , the timings on the clock or lines scribed on the film have corresponding timings which are also at specific points ( beats ) in the composer/conductor score
