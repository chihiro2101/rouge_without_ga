this wikiproject will create articles on all the terrestrial , marine , and freshwater ecoregions on earth using a consistent naming scheme link to these ecoregion articles when you need to describe broad-scale ecology to see which ones they are , go to the project 's full checklist : a checklist of terrestrial ecoregions on en-wikipedia two things need to be checked on these ecoregions : ( a ) do the ecoregion and main article subject really refer to the same area ? if not , a separate ecoregion article may be warranted list of ecoregions ( wwf ) : terrestrial , marine , and freshwater ecoregions for the entire world you can see which countries have missing or incomplete ecoregion articles and create or expand them , or create a missing country list list of ecoregions in north america ( cec ) list of ecoregions in the united states ( epa ) if anyone wishes to identify a candidate for upgrading to feature status , it would be a great help to the project similarly , it would be good to upgrade each of the biome articles to '' b '' status , as they are the base for a lot of common information add links to other articles that point to the ecoregion article some other sources : an interactive map is at ' resolve' images can be found at nasa 's blue marble earth imagery databasin 's terrestrial ecoregions of the world has both the map and a dataset for terrestrial ecoregions the encyclopedia of earth contains articles for many ecoregions , the text of which is available under a creative commons attribution-sharealike 2.5 generic license this license is compatible with wikipedia 's and the text can be re-used here the wikimedia commons maps of ecoregions category contains hundreds of ecoregion maps that can be used in ecoregion articles wwf databases include terrestrial and marine ecoregions , as well as thousands of species distributions in terms of ecoregions when claiming that a country , state , landform , or protected area is in a wwf ecoregion , you can copy-paste the following citation to the original paper : it will appear as follows : ecoregion statistics add the template to all ecoregion articles and fill out as many fields as possible add the template to the top of the talk page of any article which is in the scope of this project physical area of the ecoregion , in square kilometers and square miles the total number of plant species ( by phylum , if known ) , and the number and percentage of endemic plant species the total number of animal species ( by phylum/class , if known ) , and the number and percentage of endemic animal species article assessments help project members prioritise improvements to articles related to ecoregions project members should assess articles according to the importance and quality scales given at wikipedia : wikiproject ecoregions/assessment , and then record the results using the project template on the article talk page : : : after assessing an article , you may want to place it on your watchlist for a while , and reassess the article if you see major improvements project tast 5 is to work in support of this project user : kaarel - i am a biologist interested ( among other things ) in biogeography and improving the wikipedia articles
