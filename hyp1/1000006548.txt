add the template to the top of the talk page of any article which is in the scope of this project to see which ones they are , go to the project 's full checklist : a checklist of terrestrial ecoregions on en-wikipedia if anyone wishes to identify a candidate for upgrading to feature status , it would be a great help to the project wwf databases include terrestrial and marine ecoregions , as well as thousands of species distributions in terms of ecoregions this wikiproject will create articles on all the terrestrial , marine , and freshwater ecoregions on earth using a consistent naming scheme similarly , it would be good to upgrade each of the biome articles to '' b '' status , as they are the base for a lot of common information project members should assess articles according to the importance and quality scales given at wikipedia : wikiproject ecoregions/assessment , and then record the results using the project template on the article talk page the encyclopedia of earth contains articles for many ecoregions , the text of which is available under a creative commons attribution-sharealike 2.5 generic license list of ecoregions ( wwf ) : terrestrial , marine , and freshwater ecoregions for the entire world list of ecoregions in north america ( cec ) list of ecoregions in the united states ( epa ) project tast 5 is to work in support of this project article assessments help project members prioritise improvements to articles related to ecoregions : : : after assessing an article , you may want to place it on your watchlist for a while , and reassess the article if you see major improvements this license is compatible with wikipedia 's and the text can be re-used here two things need to be checked on these ecoregions : ( a ) do the ecoregion and main article subject really refer to the same area ? if not , a separate ecoregion article may be warranted the wikimedia commons maps of ecoregions category contains hundreds of ecoregion maps that can be used in ecoregion articles some other sources : an interactive map is at ' resolve' images can be found at nasa 's blue marble earth imagery databasin 's terrestrial ecoregions of the world has both the map and a dataset for terrestrial ecoregions user : kaarel - i am a biologist interested ( among other things ) in biogeography and improving the wikipedia articles add links to other articles that point to the ecoregion article link to these ecoregion articles when you need to describe broad-scale ecology physical area of the ecoregion , in square kilometers and square miles you can see which countries have missing or incomplete ecoregion articles and create or expand them , or create a missing country list the total number of plant species ( by phylum , if known ) , and the number and percentage of endemic plant species the total number of animal species ( by phylum/class , if known ) , and the number and percentage of endemic animal species add the template to all ecoregion articles and fill out as many fields as possible when claiming that a country , state , landform , or protected area is in a wwf ecoregion , you can copy-paste the following citation to the original paper : it will appear as follows : ecoregion statistics
