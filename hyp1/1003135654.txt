the holdfast , a root-like structure , anchors the kelp to the substrate of the ocean gas-filled bladders ( pneumatocysts ) form at the base of blades of american species , such as nereocystis lueteana , ( mert numerous sessile animals ( sponges , bryozoans and ascidians ) are found on kelp stipes and mobile invertebrate fauna are found in high densities on epiphytic algae on the kelp stipes and on kelp holdfasts until the leblanc process was commercialized in the early 19th century , burning of kelp in scotland was one of the principal industrial sources of soda ash ( predominantly sodium carbonate ) to supply the new industry in iodine synthesis , kelp ash production continued in some parts of west and north scotland , north west ireland and guernsey 283 alginate , a kelp-derived carbohydrate , is used to thicken products such as ice cream , jelly , salad dressing , and toothpaste , as well as an ingredient in exotic dog food and in manufactured goods kombu ( 昆布 in japanese , and 海带 in chinese , saccharina japonica and others ) , several pacific species of kelp , is a very important ingredient in chinese , japanese , and korean cuisines kombu is used to flavor broths and stews ( especially dashi ) , as a savory garnish ( tororo konbu ) for rice and other dishes , as a vegetable , and a primary ingredient in popular snacks ( such as tsukudani ) in russia , especially in the russian far east , and former soviet union countries several types of kelp are of commercial importance : saccharina latissima , laminaria digitata , saccharina japonica known locally as '' sea cabbage '' ( морская капуста in russian ) , it comes in retail trade in dried or frozen , as well as in canned form and used as filler in different types of salads , soups and pastries because of its high concentration of iodine , brown kelp ( laminaria ) has been used to treat goiter , an enlargement of the thyroid gland caused by a lack of iodine , since medieval times kelp has a high rate of growth and its decay is quite efficient in yielding methane , as well as sugars that can be converted to ethanol some of the earliest evidence for human use of marine resources , coming from middle stone age sites in south africa , includes the harvesting of foods such as abalone , limpets , and mussels associated with kelp forest habitats suggested that kelp forests around the pacific rim may have facilitated the dispersal of anatomically modern humans following a coastal route from northeast asia to the americas this '' kelp highway hypothesis '' suggested that highly productive kelp forests supported rich and diverse marine food webs in nearshore waters , including many types of fish , shellfish , birds , marine mammals , and seaweeds that were similar from japan to california , erlandson and his colleagues also argued that coastal kelp forests reduced wave energy and provided a linear dispersal corridor entirely at sea level , with few obstacles to maritime peoples during the highland clearances , many scottish highlanders were moved on to areas of estates known as crofts , and went to industries such as fishing and kelping ( producing soda ash from the ashes of kelp ) at least until the 1840s , when there were steep falls in the price of kelp , landlords wanted to create pools of cheap or virtually free labour , supplied by families subsisting in new crofting townships bumsted , the people 's clearance : highland emigration to british north america , 1770-1815 , 1981 but the economic collapse of the kelp industry in northern scotland during the 1820s led to further emigration , especially to north america it has negative overtones , implying the person is drifting aimlessly , and is also a homophonic expression , literally '' sea waiting '' ) this expression is contrasted with the employed returnee , having a dynamic ability to travel across the ocean : the '' sea turtle '' and is also homophonic with another word , literally '' sea return '' ) file : giant kelp ( macrocystis pyrifera ) 01.jpg giant kelp in monterey bay aquarium 's kelp forest exhibit file : scuba diver in kelp forest.jpg scuba diver in kelp forest file : blue rockfish in kelp forest.jpg blue rockfish in kelp forest file : anemone and seastar in kelp forest.jpg anemone and seastar in kelp forest file : kelp forest-blue.jpg an underwater shot of a kelp forest file : kelpforesti2500ppx.jpg a kelp forest file : close up of ecklonia maxima leaf.jpg a close up view of ecklonia maxima , giant brown kelp file : kelpwik.jpg kelp found along the coast of la jolla shores lamouroux ( oarweed ;
