brigitte boisselier said the headquarters of clonaid was located in las vegas and that clonaid did not have enough funds for human cloning research ( highlight ) on december 19 , 1998 , a new

performed the first human reproductive cloning boisselier was therefore stating her belief that her procedure had resulted in a clone , not announcing results showing that the child was a clone however , some members of the united states congress believed that the jurisdiction of the fda on human cloning matters was shaky and decided to push congress to explicitly ban human cloning panos zavos , a former professor of the university of kentucky , at the time had plans to create human clone embryos , but he stated to the effect that clonaid 's claims were without merit and that eve did not exist severino antinori , who had worked with zavos on the development of human clone embryos , was critical of klondyke 's announcement , and said of it that , '' an announcement of this type has no scientific corroboration and risks creating confusion '' robert lanza of advanced cell technologies said that clonaid has no record of accomplishment for cloning anything , but he said that if clonaid actually succeeded , there would be public unrest that may lead to the banning of therapeutic cloning , which has the capacity to cure millions of patients arthur caplan , the director of the center for bioethics at the university of pennsylvania , expressed concerns that many dead and sick children could result from the cloning of human beings clonaid spokeswoman nadine gary claimed that
