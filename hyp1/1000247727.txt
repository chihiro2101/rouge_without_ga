initially , '' singlish '' and '' manglish '' were essentially the same language , when both singapore and the states now comprising peninsular malaysia were under various forms of direct and indirect british rule , though not forming a single administrative unit except between 1963 and 1965 while english is widely used , many malay words have become part of common usage in informal english or manglish an example is suffixing sentences with lah , as in , '' do n't be so worried-lah '' , which is usually used to present a sentence as rather light-going and not so serious ; the suffix has no specific meaning however , chinese dialects also make abundant use of the suffix lah and there is some disagreement as to which language it was originally borrowed from there is also a strong influence from malay , mandarin , cantonese , hokkien , and tamil , which are other major dialects and languages spoken in malaysia in malaysia , manglish is considered to be a less formal form of malaysian english which has features of a pidgin or a creole , rather than a fully-fledged creole language while all varieties of english used by malaysians may be considered malaysian english , some make a distinction between malaysian english and manglish ; malaysian english being a form of english that largely follows the standard rules of english grammar but with some local characteristics , while manglish is a pidgin that does not follow the grammatical rules or structure of english many malaysians however tend to refer to the colloquialisms used by those taught in english-medium school as malaysian english , while some argued for the basilect form or pidgin as the '' real '' malaysian english at the lexical level , limited lexis is used and consequently , a number of words serve a variety of functions , giving extended meanings not normally accepted in standard british english the term malaysian english is not used in any official context except for the ever-changing school curriculum modules in attempts to improve the command of english but without going into advanced lessons speakers of manglish from the country 's different ethnic groups tend to intersperse varying amounts of expressions or interjections from their mother tongue – be it malay , chinese or one of the indian languages – which , in some cases , qualifies as a form of code-switching verbs or adjectives from other languages often have english affixes , and conversely sentences may be constructed using english words in another language 's syntax '' dollar '' – a loaned currency used especially in relation to business transactions , in lieu of '' ringgit '' ( ringgit malaysia ) '' la-la '' replaces the older derogatory term '' ah lien '' that is used to describe girls who wear heavy make-up and outstanding clothes and accessories , which usually end up being rather bad taste instead of looking sophisticated or in fashion '' la-la zai '' and '' la-la mui '' is commonly used to make distinctions between the genders , with the former referring to guys and the latter referring to girls '' slumber '' – relaxed , laid-back ; possibly a conflation of the malay '' selamba '' , meaning nonchalant , and the english '' slumber '' '' syok '' or '' shiok '' is a borrowing from malay syok meaning '' pleasing '' or '' attractive '' , possibly originally persian šoḵ ( cheerful , spirited ) or arabic šawq ( desire , passion ) used when wanting to put an emphasis on something saying it is great or big—whether it is in a good or bad way does not matter as long as it is '' huge '' e.g '' cabut/cantas '' – to run off , flee or to escape ( 'cabut ' is a malay word meaning to pull or pulling out as a transitive verb , or to become detached as an intransitive verb ) '' gostan '' – reverse a vehicle , probably from the nautical term '' go astern '' ( mostly used in terengganu , kelantan , kedah and penang ) or '' go stunt '' '' jadi '' – happened , succeeded ( derived from the malay word 'jadi ' , and may sometimes mean 'so ' as in , '' jadi ? '' '' so what ? '' ) '' jalan '' – to walk ( from malay for '' road '' or '' walk '' ) '' kacau '' – to disturb , e.g '' kenasai '' / '' kanasai '' – to get into trouble , a mix of malay kena meaning '' get '' or '' meet '' and hokkien sai ( 屎 , faeces ) to form the phrase '' hit by shit '' '' i makan 1/2 biji on manchester united '' means '' i bet 1/2 handicap on manchester united '' ) '' mamak '' / '' mamak stall '' – from the term mamak ( a slang for indian or indian muslims ) , it is used to refer to indian muslim restaurants in malaysia '' mempersiasuikan '' - to embarrass , derived by adding malay affixes '' mem '' , '' per '' and '' kan '' to a hokkien word '' '' ( 泻衰 ) meaning shame '' ) '' pengsan '' – to faint ( malay ) '' pon '' – to skip school/play truant/apon ( from malay '' ponteng '' , meaning the same ) '' saman '' – to issue a fine , usually in relation to a traffic offence , from '' summons '' '' ) '' sit '' – since this is the word used for riding in a vehicle in malay and in chinese dialects , it is used in the same way in english , e.g from the malay exclamation 'alamak ' , which is a combination of '' allah '' and '' mak '' ( mother ) '' abuden ? '' - combination of min nan '' a-bo '' , meaning '' if not '' in english , and the word '' then '' '' die/finish/gone/habis/mampus/mampui/sei/see/gg/pok kai/ '' – generic exclamations from various languages to indicate '' trouble '' , used like the english '' dead '' or '' dead end '' , but the word '' die '' does not mean to die literally '' podaa ! '' – from tamil equivalent to the american phrase , '' get out ! '' when expressing disbelief '' walao eh '' – also an exclamation of amazement , either from hokkien or teochew , but came via singapore '' wah '' - to express amazement '' wei '' – exclamation when conversing to a close friend , or used as '' hello '' when answering phone ( from chinese , '' wei '' ) '' it '' does n't refer to the subject , but rather to the entire preceding clause ( '' is it so ? '' ) this is comparable to the french phrase '' n'est-ce pas ? '' ( literally '' is n't it ? '' ) and the german usage of '' '' open collar , pocket no dollar '' – expression reflecting linkage between extravagant appearance and persona , and illusion of wealth '' that 's why '' - expression used to express agreement with a statement ( example : '' it 's so hot today ! '' '' that 's why ! '' ) this is because originally in malay , 'lah ' is appended to the end of the word and is not a separate word by itself in malay , 'lah ' is used to change a verb into a command or to soften its tone , particularly when usage of the verb may seem impolite similarly , 'lah ' is frequently used with imperatives in singlish , such as the command , '' drink lah ! '' ( come on , drink ! ) 'lah ' also occurs frequently with '' yah '' and '' no '' ( hence '' yah lah '' and '' no lah '' ) , resulting in a less brusque sound , thus facilitating the flow of conversation in cantonese , lah ( 啦 ) is placed at the end of a sentence in imperatives making it sound more like a request than an order lah is often used with brusque , short , negative responses : do n't have lah ! ( brusque response to , '' lend me some money , can ? '' ) do n't know already lah ! ( brusque response to someone fumbling with an explanation in most cases , loh is used in direct response to a question or query with the connotation that the respondent is somewhat impatient or annoying because the person thinks that the answer is so obvious that the question should not have been raised from the start for example , to show argumentative mood or making emphasis , one would say , '' you lo ( it 's your fault ) , if it 's not for you we would n't be in trouble now ! '' and possibly in response , the other would say , '' eh , i never forced you to follow me here loh ! '' another example is '' traffic jam loh ! '' when asked by a friend why he or she is late to an occasion manglish is non-rhotic sometimes referred to as r-fullness/r-lessness , spoken manglish is similar to the standard variety of english in singapore and britain , in that the final /r/ consonant is dropped during speech this is equivalent to the chinese 有 yǒu ( to have ) : got question ? – is there a question ? / do you have a question ? yesterday ar , east coast park got so many people ! – there were so many people at east coast park yesterday however , manglish is markedly more influenced by the malay language , with the majority population in malaysia being the ethnic malays ; while singlish is more influenced by hokkien dialect or mandarin chinese , with the majority population being the han chinese for example , '' kena '' ( a malay word , somewhat of a prefix added for the sake of turning an action verb into passive form ) might be more often used in manglish ; while singlish more frequently uses words like '' liao '' ( meaning '' already '' in hokkien ) , '' nia '' ( meaning '' only '' in hokkien ) however , referring the aforementioned example , '' kena '' is also used in singlish and '' liao '' in mangish , only to a less extent the word 'manglish ' is also used to describe the english spoken by malayalam speakers from the kerala state in india having a malayalam accent , mainly by those who have studied in malayalam-medium schools
