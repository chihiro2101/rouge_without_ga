the second was on august 1 , 1996 , of ibm 's two packages of opendoc components for os/2 , available on the club opendoc website for a 30 day free trial : the person pak is '' components aimed at organizing names , addresses , and other personal information '' , for use with personal information management ( pim ) applications , at 229 ; and the table pak '' to store rows and columns in a database file '' at 269 as part of the aim alliance between apple , ibm , and motorola , opendoc is one of apple 's earliest experiments with open standards and collaborative development methods with other companies another problem was the fact that each part saved its data within bento ( the former name of an opendoc compound document file format ) in its own internal binary format , and it was very common to find one component could not open a document created by another , even though the internal data represented similar objects ( spreadsheet data for instance ) for instance , it took significant effort for the system to be able to turn a text file with some pictures into a microsoft word document , both because the text editor had no idea what was in the embedded objects , and because the proprietary microsoft format was undocumented and required reverse engineering opendoc was soon discontinued , with steve jobs ( who had been at next during this development ) noting that they '' put a bullet through opendoc 's head '' , and most of the apple advanced technology group was laid off in a big reduction in force in march 1997 with opendoc entering the historic aim alliance between apple , ibm , and motorola , apple was also involved in taligent during some of this period , which promised somewhat similar functionality although based on very different underlying mechanisms this initial overhead became less important as the number of documents open increased , since the basic cost was for shared libraries which implemented the system , but it was large compared to entry level machines of the day the development team realized in mid-1992 that an industry coalition was needed to promote the system , and created the component integration laboratories ( ci labs ) with ibm and wordperfect ibm introduced the system object model ( som ) shared library system to the project , which became a major part of apple 's future efforts , in and out of opendoc a component document system would only work with a known document format that all the components could use , and so soon the standardized document format was pulled into the component software effort this problem was not unique to opendoc , and in fact was also experienced by the microsoft equivalent , object linking and embedding ( ole ) in order to obtain a windows 95 compliance logo from microsoft , one had to meet certain interoperability tests which were quite difficult to meet without adoption of ole technology , even though the technology was largely only useful in integrating with microsoft office at about the same time , a group of third-party developers had met at the apple worldwide developers conference ( wwdc '91 ) and tried to establish a standardized document format , based conceptually on the electronic arts interchange file format ( iff ) another issue was that opendoc had little in common with most '' real world '' document formats , and so opendoc documents could really only be used by other opendoc machines for instance , opening a simple text editor part would often require 2 megabytes of ram or more , whereas the same editor written as a standalone application could be as small as 32 kb components of the e-slate educational microworlds platform were originally implemented as opendoc parts in c++ on both macos and windows , reimplemented later ( after the discontinuation of opendoc ) as java applets and eventually as javabeans
