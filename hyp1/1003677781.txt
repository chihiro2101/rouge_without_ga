the act of copying/transferring text from one part of a computer-based document ( '' buffer '' ) to a different location within the same or different computer-based document was a part of the earliest on-line computer editors since moving a region of text requires first removing it from its initial location and then inserting it into its new location , various schemes had to be invented to allow for this multi-step process to be specified by the user the inversion from verb—object to object—verb on which copy and paste are based , where the user selects the object to be operated before initiating the operation , was an innovation crucial for the success of the desktop metaphor as it allowed copy and move operations based on direct manipulation inspired by early line and character editors that broke a move or copy operation into two steps—between which the user could invoke a preparatory action such as navigation—larry tesler proposed the names '' cut '' and '' copy '' for the first step and '' paste '' for the second step apple mapped the functionalities to key combinations consisting of the command key ( a special modifier key ) held down while typing the letters x ( for cut ) , c ( for copy ) , and v ( for paste ) , choosing a handful of keyboard shortcuts to control basic editing operations the keys involved all cluster together at the left end of the bottom row of the standard qwerty keyboard , and each key is combined with a special modifier key to perform the desired operation : z to undo x to cut c to copy v to paste the ibm common user access ( cua ) standard also uses combinations of the insert , del , shift and control keys the original copy/cut/paste workflow , as implemented at parc , utilized a unique workflow : with two windows on the same screen , the user could use the mouse to pick a point at which to make an insertion in one window ( or a segment of text to replace ) the user selects or '' highlights '' the text or file for moving by some method , typically by dragging over the text or file name with the pointing-device or holding down the shift key while using the arrow keys to move the text cursor ( the paste operation does not typically destroy the clipboard text : it remains available in the clipboard and the user can insert additional copies at other points ) whereas cut-and-paste often takes place with a mouse-equivalent in windows-like gui environments , it may also occur entirely from the keyboard , especially in unix text editors , such as pico or vi cutting and pasting without a mouse can involve a selection ( for which is pressed in most graphical systems ) or the entire current line , but it may also involve text after the cursor until the end of the line and other more sophisticated operations when a software environment provides cut and paste functionality , a nondestructive operation called copy usually accompanies them ; copy places a copy of the selected text in the clipboard without removing it from its original location the clipboard usually stays invisible , because the operations of cutting and pasting , while actually independent , usually take place in quick succession , and the user ( usually ) needs no assistance in understanding the operation or maintaining mental context together with copy and paste this can be used for quick and easy replacement of repeated text : select the text that you want to replace ( i.e by double clicking ) put the text in the find buffer with overwrite the selected text with your replacement text select the replacement text ( try to avoid lifting your hands from the keyboard ) copy the replacement text find the next or previous occurrence / paste the replacement text repeat the last two steps as often as needed or in short : select , replstr , , , , , , copy and paste can be automated with the help of a program that would iterate through the values list and paste them to the active window ( computing ) in a spreadsheet , moving ( cut and paste ) need not equate to copying ( copy and paste ) and then deleting the original : when moving , references to the moved cells may move accordingly favorite clips that a user frequently pastes ( for example , the current date , or the various fields of a user 's contact info ) can be kept standing ready to be pasted with a few clicks or keystrokes tracking and recording copy operations of users and using that data as implicit user feedback on the website content can be beneficial in a wide range of applications and uses , including in automatic summarization , and in text simplification .
