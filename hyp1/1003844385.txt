having been influenced by the '' new geography '' and the work of the processualist david clarke , as his research progressed , he became increasingly sceptical that such models and simulations actually tested or proved anything , coming to the conclusion that a particular pattern in the archaeological record could be produced by a number of different simulated processes , and that there was no way to accurately test which of these alternatives was correct a number of post-processualists , such as michael shanks , christopher tilley and peter ucko , undermined '' archaeology 's claims to be an authoritative source of knowledge about the past '' , thereby '' encouraging people to question and resist all forms of authority… this position was hailed by its supporters as democratizing archaeology and purging it… of elitist pretensions '' structuralism itself was a theory developed by the french anthropologist claude lévi-strauss ( 1908–2009 ) , and held to the idea that '' cultural patterns need not be caused by anything outside themselves… and that underlying every culture was a deep structure , or essence , governed by its own laws , that people were unaware of but which ensured regularities in the cultural productions that emanate from it some had already anticipated the theory 's emergence , with the social anthropologist edmund leach informing the assembled archaeologists at a 1971 discussion on the topic of '' the explanation of culture change '' held at the university of sheffield that cultural structuralism , which was then popular among social anthropologists , would soon make its way into the archaeological community preucel examined the post-processual movement 's '' radical critique '' of processualism , and while accepting that it had some merit and highlighted some important points , they came to the conclusion that on the whole , the post-processual approach was flawed because it failed to produce an explicit methodology in effect , he came to believe that even using the processual approach to understanding archaeological data , there were still many different ways that that data could be interpreted , and that therefore radically different conclusions could be put forward by different archaeologists , despite processualism 's claim that using the scientific method it could gain objective fact from the archaeological record in his introduction to the book , hodder noted that : : during the early period of exploration and development of ideas , premature conference presentations and individual seminars were given by various members of the cambridge group in other archaeological departments in england and abroad post-processual archaeology , however , questioned this stance , and instead emphasized that archaeology was subjective rather than objective , and that what truth could be ascertained from the archaeological record was often relative to the viewpoint of the archaeologist responsible for unearthing and presenting the data in the 1960s and 1970s , feminist archaeology emerged as adherents of the second wave feminism movement began to argue that women in the archaeological record had been ignored by archaeologists up until that time although it would not be actually termed '' post-processual archaeology '' until 1985 ( by one of its most prominent proponents , ian hodder ) , an archaeological alternative to processual archaeology had begun to develop during the 1970s as the archaeologists colin renfrew and paul bahn noted , '' for its most severe critics , post-processualism , while making a number of valid criticisms , simply developed some of the ideas and theoretical problems introduced by processualism post-processualists have also adopted beliefs regarding human agency , arguing that in other theoretical approaches to archaeology such as cultural-historical and processual , '' the individual is lost '' , and humans are therefore portrayed as '' passive dupes who blindly follow social rules to these critics it brought in a variety of approaches from other disciplines , so that the term '' postprocessual , '' while rather neatly echoing the epithet '' postmodern '' in literary studies , was a shade arrogant in presuming to supersede what it might quite properly claim to complement post-processual archaeology began in britain during the late 1970s , spearheaded by a number of british archaeologists who had become interested in aspects of french marxist anthropology post-processualist daniel miller believed that the positivist approach of the processualists , in holding that only that which could be sensed , tested and predicted was valid , only sought to produce technical knowledge that facilitated the oppression of ordinary people by elites in particular , the contrasts which were set up by us and by outside scholars allowed the views of the seminar group , and the differences of viewpoint within the group , to be clarified
