in catholic philosophy , merit ( as understood to be a property of a good work which entitles the doer to receive a reward ) , is a salutary act to which god , in whose service the work is done , in consequence of his infallible promise may give a reward ( prœmium , merces ) the relation between merit and reward furnishes the intrinsic reason why in the matter of service and its remuneration , the guiding norm can be only the virtue of justice , and not disinterested kindness or pure mercy ; for it would destroy the very notion of reward to conceive of it as a free gift of bounty ( cf if , however , salutary acts can in virtue of divine justice give the right to an eternal reward , this is possible only because they themselves have their root in gratuitous grace , and consequently are of their very nature dependent ultimately on grace , as the council of trent emphatically declares ( sess from an ethical point of view the difference practically amounts to this that , if the reward due to condign merit be withheld , there is a violation of right and justice and the consequent obligation in conscience to make restitution , while , in the case of congruous merit , to withhold the reward involves no violation of right and no obligation to restore , it being merely an offence against what is fitting or a matter of personal discrimination ( acceptio personarum ) in christian theology , man possesses nothing of his own ; all that he has and all that he does is a gift of god , and , since god is infinitely self-sufficient , there is no advantage or benefit which man can by his services confer upon him , of the influence of actual grace , is clear from the fact that every act meriting heaven must evidently be supernatural just as heaven itself is supernatural , and that consequently it can not be performed without the help of prevenient and assisting grace , which is necessary even for the just while some require the motive of faith ( motivum fidei ) in order to have merit , others demand in addition the motive of charity ( motivum caritatis ) , and thus , by rendering the conditions more difficult , considerably restrict the extent of meritorious works ( as distinguished from merely good works ) others again set down as the only condition of merit that the good work of the just man , who already has habitual faith and charity , be in conformity with the divine law , and require no other special motive the opinion proposed by a few theologians ( hirscher , schell ) , that for certain classes of men there may still be a possibility of conversion after death , is contrary to the revealed truth that the particular judgment ( judicium particulare ) determines instantly and definitively whether the future is to be one of eternal happiness or of eternal misery ( cf baptized children , who die before attaining the age of reason , are admitted to heaven without merits on the sole title of inheritance ( titulus hœreditatis ) ; in the case of adults , however , there is the additional title of reward ( titulus mercedis ) , and for that reason they will enjoy a greater measure of eternal happiness in the parable of the vine christ expressly declares the '' abiding in him '' a necessary condition for '' bearing fruit '' : '' he that abideth in me , and i in him , the same beareth much fruit '' ( john , xv , 5 ) ; and this constant union with christ is effected only by sanctifying grace merit requires on the part of god that he accept ( in actu secundo ) the good work as meritorious , even though the work in itself ( in actu primo ) and previous to its acceptance by god , be already truly meritorious louis and philadelphia : concordia publishing house and fortress press , 1955-1986 ) , 34:337 the righteousness by which the person is justified ( declared righteous ) is not his own ( theologically , proper righteousness ) but that of another , christ , ( alien righteousness ) , iii , ii , 4 ) good works are '' impurities and defilement '' ( inquinamenta et sordes ) , but god covers their innate hideousness with the cloak of the merits of christ , and imputes them to the predestined as good works in order that he may requite them not with life eternal , but at most with a temporal reward apart from earlier dogmatic declarations given in the second synod of orange of 529 and in the fourth lateran council of 1215 ( see denzinger , 191 , 430 ) , the council of trent upheld the traditional doctrine of merit by insisting that life everlasting is both a grace and a reward ( sess
