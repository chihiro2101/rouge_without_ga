furthermore , while the irish republic had a constitution , of sorts , in the form of the dáil constitution , this was a very brief document and had been intended to be only provisional among these were that : the new state would be called the irish free state and would be a dominion of the british commonwealth ; the king would be the head of state and would be represented by a governor general ; members of the oireachtas ( parliament ) would swear an oath of allegiance to the irish free state and declare their fidelity to the king in due course , '' the house of the parliament , '' provided for by that act , was elected and met on 9 september 1922 , and calling itself dáil éireann , proceeded to sit as a constituent assembly for the settlement of what became the constitution of the irish free state after that process was completed , a bill entitled the constitution of the irish free state ( saorstát éireann ) bill was introduced into dáil éireann ( the third dáil ) in september 1922 , the dáil sitting as a '' constituent assembly '' article 83 of the constitution provided that '' the passing and adoption of this constitution by the constituent assembly and the british parliament shall be announced as soon as may be , and not later than the sixth day of december , nineteen hundred and twenty-two , by proclamation of his majesty , and this constitution shall come into operation on the issue of such proclamation this act recited that the house of parliament constituted pursuant to the irish free state ( agreement ) act , 1922 , sitting as a constituent assembly for the settlement of the constitution of the irish free state , had passed the measure set forth in the schedule to the act , ( namely the constitution adopted by dáil éireann ) , which it then referred to as '' the constituent act '' it then provided that the constituent act should be the constitution of the irish free state and should come into operation on the same being proclaimed by his majesty in accordance with article 83 of the constitution referring to the constitution as a '' measure '' whereby the constitution appearing as the first schedule to the constituent act was declared to be the constitution of the irish free state , the royal proclamation went on to '' announce and proclaim that the constitution of the irish free state as the same was passed and adopted by the said constituent assembly has been passed and adopted by parliament '' the 6 december 1922 was the latest possible date allowed for by the anglo-irish treaty for the continued authority of the provisional government set up by the treaty pending '' the constitution of a parliament and government of the irish free state '' besides abolishing the oath of allegiance , a requirement of the anglo-irish treaty , the act also expressly repealed the provisions both of the constitution proper and of the constitution of the irish free state ( saorstát éireann ) act 1922 that required compliance with the treaty under british constitutional legal theory , the constitution of the irish free state ( saorstát éireann ) act 1922 held the force of law because of the enactment of the united kingdom 's irish free state constitution act 1922 however , under irish law the constitution '' derived its authority not from the act of the imperial parliament passed on the 5th december , 1922 , or from the proclamation made on the 6th december , 1922 , but from the act of dáil éireann sitting as a constituent assembly passed on the 25th october , 1922 '' the constitution of the irish free state ( saorstát éireann ) act 1922 consisted of only a short preamble and three short sections , but was a far longer document because , as noted above , it included as schedules the full text of both the constitution proper and the anglo-irish treaty
