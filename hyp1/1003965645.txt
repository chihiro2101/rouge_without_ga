their usual ethnic name derives from the chinese name for the islands , '' liuqiu '' ( also spelled as loo choo , lew chew , luchu , and more ) , which in the japanese language is pronounced '' ryuukyuu '' according to the recent genetic studies , the ryukyuan people share more alleles with the jōmon period ( 16,000–3,000 years ago ) hunter-gatherers and ainu people than the yamato people , have smaller genetic contributions from asian continental populations , which supports the dual-structure model of k hanihara ( 1991 ) , a widely accepted theory which suggests that the yamato japanese are more admixed with asian agricultural continental people ( from the korean peninsula ) than the ainu and the ryukyuans , with major admixture occurring in and after the yayoi period ( 3,000-1,700 years ago ) the research on the skeletal remains from the neolithic shell midden period ( also known as kaizuka period ) in okinawa , as well from the gusuku period , showed predominance of female haplogroups d4 and m7a and their genetic continuity in the contemporary female population of okinawa it is assumed that m7a represents '' jomon genotype '' introduced by a paleolithic ancestor from southeast asia or the south asia , around the last glacial maximum with the ryukyu islands as one of the probable origin spots , in contrast , the frequency of the d4 haplogroup is relatively high in east asian populations , including in japan , indicating immigrant yayoi people , probably by the end of the late kaizuka period , while haplogroup b4 presumably ancient aboriginal taiwanese ancestry however , as in the contemporary japanese population m7 showed a decrease , whereas the frequency of the haplogroup n9b showed an increase from the south to north direction , it indicates that the mobility pattern of females and males was different as the distribution of y haplogroups do not show a geographical gradient in contrast to mtdna , meaning mainly different maternal origins of the contemporary ryukyuan and ainu people the ryukyuans differ strongly from jōmon and ainu people , which , according to the authors , is a strong evidence for the replacement of jōmon-related groups by the ancestors of the ryukyuans the yayoi culture which had a major influence on the japanese islands , is traditionally dated from 3rd century bce and recently from around 1000 bce , and is notable for the introduction of yayoi-type pottery , metal tools and cultivation of rice , however although some yayoi pottery and tools were excavated on the okinawa islands , the rice was not cultivated before the 12th century ce , nor the yayoi and the following kofun period ( 250–538 ce ) culture expanded into the ryukyus the southern ryukyus culture was isolated from the northern , and its shimotabaru period ( 4,500–3,000 ybp ) was characterized by a specific style of pottery , and the aceramic period ( 2,500–800 ybp ) , during which no pottery was produced in this region according to the shan hai jing , the yan had relations with the wa ( dwarf , short ) people living southeast of korea , who could be related to both the mainland japanese or ryukyuan people the futile search for the elixir of immortality by qin shi huang , the founder of qin dynasty ( 221 bc–206 bc ) , in which the emperor tried to cooperate with '' happy immortals '' who dwelt on the islands , could be related to both japan and ryukyu islands there 's lack of evidence that the missions by han dynasty ( 206 bc – 220 ad ) reached the islands , however as the japanese did reach han 's luoyang , notes from 57 ce do mention a general practice of tattooing among the people of '' hundred kingdoms '' in the eastern islands , a practice which was widespread and survived only among the okinawan 's women , ainu in hokkaido , and atayal people in taiwan cao wei ( 220–265 ) and han dynasty record show that the inhabitants of western and southern japan and okinawa had a lot in common regarding political-social institutions until the 2nd century ce - they were of small stature , bred oxen and swine , as well were ruled by women , with special influence of women sorceresses , which is related to the ryukyuan noro priestesses which were closely associated with local political power until the 20th century , as well the ryukyuan swine economy culture until world war ii the lack of written record resulted with later , 17th century royal tales both under chinese and japanese influence , which were efforts by local chieftains to explain the '' divine right '' of their royal authority , as well the then-political interests of tokugawa shōguns from minamoto clan who wanted to legitimize japanese domination over okinawa this period is also notable , compared to mainland japan , for fairly late introduction of agricultural production of rice , wheat , millet and the overseas trading of these goods , as well during shubanjunki 's rule the introduction of japanese kana writing system in its older and simple phonetic form after the years of famine and epidemic during the gihon 's rule , eiso introduced regular taxation system ( of weapons , grains and cloth ) in 1264 and as the government gained strength , the control extended from okinawa toward the islands of kume , kerama , iheya , and amami ōshima ( 1266 ) as in 1371 , china initiated its maritime prohibition policy ( haijin ) to japan , ryukyu gained a lot from its position as intermediary in the trade between japan and china they shipped horses , sulphur and seashells to china , from china brought ceramics , copper , and iron , from southeast asian countries bought tin , ivory , spices ( pepper ) , wood ( sappanwood ) , which they sold to japan , korea or china , as well as transporting chinese goods to hakata bay from where swords , silver and gold were brought between 1416 and 1429 , chūzan chieftain shō hashi successfully unified the principalities into the ryukyuan kingdom ( 1429–1879 ) with the castle town shuri as royal capital , founded the first shō dynasty , and the island continued to prosper through maritime trade , especially tributary relations with the ming dynasty the period of shō shin 's ( 1477–1526 ) rule , descendant from the second shō dynasty , is notable for peace and relative prosperity , peak in overseas trade , as well as expansion of the kingdom 's firm control to kikaijima , miyako-jima and yaeyama islands ( 1465–1524 ) , while during shō sei ( 1526-1555 ) to amami ōshima ( 1537 ) in the early 17th century during the tokugawa shogunate ( 1603–1867 ) , the first shōgun tokugawa ieyasu intended to subject the kingdom to enable intermediary trade with china , and in 1603 ordered the ryukyuan king to pay his respect to the shogunate as the king did not react , with the instruction of the shōgun , the satsuma domain of the shimazu clan in kyūshū incorporated some of kingdom 's territory during the 1609 invasion of ryukyu during the meiji period ( 1868–1912 ) the process began , according to which the ryukyuan kingdom came under the jurisdiction of kagoshima prefecture in 1871 , encompassing the southern tip of kyushu and the ryukyuan islands to its south ; this created the ryukyu domain ( 1872–1879 ) of meiji-era japan this method of gradual integration was designed to avoid both ryukyuan and chinese protests , with the ruling shuri castle unaware of the significance of these developments , including japan 's decision to grant political representation to the ryukyuan islanders involved in the japanese invasion of taiwan ( 1874 ) in 1875 , the ryukyuan people were forced to terminate their tributary relations with china , against their preference for a state of dual allegiance to both china and japan , something a then-weakened china was unable to stop on three occasions between 1875 and 1879 , the last ryukyuan king , shō tai , refused to submit to the demands placed upon his people , and in 1879 , his domain was formally abolished and established as okinawa prefecture , forcing his move to tokyo with the reduced status of viscount members of the ryukyuan aristocratic classes such as kōchi chōjō and rin seikō continued to resist annexation for almost two decades ; however , following the first sino-japanese war ( 1894-1895 ) , both chinese and ryukyuan interest in sovereignty faded as china renounced its claims to the island during the meiji period , as with the ainu people of hokkaido , the ryukyuan people had their own culture , religion , traditions and language suppressed by the meiji government in the face of forced assimilation from the 1880s onwards , schools forbade the display of ryukyuan styles of dress , hairstyles and other visual aspects , considering them to be backwards and inferior , with students forced to wear japanese clothing and to assimilate into japanese culture indoctrination into a militaristic and emperor-centred ideology for children began from the age of beginning elementary school onwards ; the ultimate goal of this education was a total unification of the ryukyuan people into the yamato people , embodying the ideal of ethnic purity , with contemporary literature for the time ignoring japan 's minorities between 1920 and 1921 , a fall in sugar prices , as well as the transfer of japan 's sugar production to taiwan , led to ryukyu being the poorest prefecture , despite having the heaviest taxation burden ; the drop in sugar prices would continue into 1931 , further worsening the situation after the war , the ryukyu islands were occupied by the united states military government of the ryukyu islands ( 1945–1950 ) , but the u.s whereas the japanese had enjoyed political freedom and economic prosperity in the post-war years , the facilities , used for the purposes of japanese regional security against the communism threat , had a negative economic impact on the islands , leading to many ryukyuans feeling cheated , some considering the facilities a national disgrace military rape incident , and by 110,000 people in 2007 due to the japanese ministry of education 's textbook revisions ( see mext controversy ) which critics say downplays the involvement of the japanese military in the forced mass suicide of the civilians during the battle of okinawa for many years the emperors avoided visiting okinawa , with the first ever in history done by akihito in 1993 , since it was assumed that his visits would likely cause uproar , as in july 1975 when akihito as a crown prince visited okinawa and a firebomb was thrown at him , although these tensions have eased in recent years furthermore , okinawa has long had the highest life expectancy at older ages , as well has had among the highest prevalence of centenarians among the 47 japanese prefectures , also the world , since records began to be kept by the ministry of health in the early 1960s despite the high birth rate and expanding population of okinawa prefecture heinrich , patrick , '' language loss and revitalization in the ryukyu islands , '' japan focus , november 10 , 2005 ; ______ , '' what leaves a mark should no longer stain : progressive erasure and reversing language shift activities in the ryukyu islands , '' first international small island cultures conference at kagoshima university , centre for the pacific islands , february 7–10 , 2005 ; citing shiro hattori previously ideologically considered by the japanese scholars as a dialect and descendant from the old japanese language , the ryukyuan languages are a sister and mutually unintelligible branch of japanese and sometime hachijō language , and a branch of japonic languages the estimated time of separation between ryukyuan and mainland japanese is a matter of debate due to methodological problems ; older estimates ( 1959–2009 ) varied between 300 bce and 700 ce , while novel ( 2009–2011 ) around 2nd century bce to 100 ce , which has a lack of correlation with archeology and new chronology according to which yayoi period started around 950 bce , or the proposed spread of the proto-ryukyuan speakers to the islands in the 10–12th century from kyushu as the japanese ( or yamato people ) learned to write and read a thousand years before the ryukyuans and absorbed many chinese language forms , the early literature which records the language of the old japanese imperial court show archaisms which are closer to okinawan dialects the ryukyuan language is divided into two main groups , northern ryukyuan languages and southern ryukyuan languages , and generally are considered the existence of five ryukyuan languages ; amami , okinawa , miyako , yaeyama and yonaguni , while the sixth kunigami is added due to diversity speaking a ryukyuan language was deemed an unpatriotic act , by 1939 a speaker was denied service and employment in government offices , while by the battle of okinawa in 1945 the military was commanded to consider ryukyuan speakers as spies ( death penalty ) with many reports that such action was carried out after ww ii , during the united states occupation the ryukyuan languages and identity were distinctively promoted , also because of ideo-political reasons to separate the ryukyus from japan , however as the resentment against the occupation intensified their rapport and unification with japan , since 1972 followed re-incursion of the standard japanese and further diminution of the ryukyuan languages the introduction of buddhism is ascribed to a 13th century priest from japan ( mostly funeral rites , while the 14th century trade relations resulted with korean buddhism influences ( including some in architecture ) , as well shinto practices from japan the foremost account , which claimed common origin between the japanese and ryukyuan people , was made-up by shō shōken in the 17th century , to end up the pilgrimage of the ryukyu king and chief priestess to the kudaka island during the meiji period the government replaced buddhism with shintoism as the islands ' state religion , and ordered ; rearrangement of statues and redesign of shrines and temples to incorporate native deities into national shinto pantheon ; shinto worship preceded native , buddhist , or christian ritual ; transformation of local divinities into guardian gods although rice is a staple food ( taco rice mixes it with beef ) , pork ( mimigaa and chiragaa , dishes rafute and soki ) , seaweed , rich miso ( fermented soybean ) pastes and soups ( zosui ) , sweet potato and brown sugar all
