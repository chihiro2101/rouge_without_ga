his father was an apothecary , and an amateur collector of minerals , coins , fossils , and insects from around the world swammerdam received his doctorate in medicine in 1667 under van horne for his dissertation on the mechanism of respiration , published under the title de respiratione usuque pulmonum his father pressured him to earn a living , but swammerdam persevered and in late 1669 published historia insectorum generalis ofte algemeene verhandeling van de bloedeloose dierkens ( the general history of insects , or general treatise on little bloodless animals ) as a result , swammerdam was forced , at least occasionally , to practice medicine in order to finance his own research when swammerdam published the general history of insects , or general treatise on little bloodless animals later that year he not only did away with the idea that insects lacked internal anatomy , but also attacked the christian notion that insects originated from spontaneous generation and that their life cycle was a metamorphosis swammerdam declared war on '' vulgar errors '' and the symbolic interpretation of insects was , in his mind , incompatible with the power of god , the almighty architect whereas modern biologists speak of the grub , the pupa and the adult as stages in the life cycle of one individual butterfly , harvey and his contemporaries always regarded the grub as one individual and the butterfly as another having believed that his scientific research was a tribute to the creator , he started to fear that he may be worshipping the idol of curiosities his religious crisis only interrupted his scientific research briefly and until his premature death aged 43 he worked on what was to become his main work of historie der insecten convinced that all insects were worth studying , swammerdam had compiled an epic treatise on as many insects as he could , using the microscope and dissection inspired by marcello malpighi , in de bombyce swammerdam described the anatomy of silkworms , mayflies , ants , stag beetles , cheese mites , bees and many other insects swammerdam 's praise of the louse went on to become a classic : '' herewith i offer you the omnipotent finger of god in the anatomy of a louse : wherein you will find miracle heaped on miracle and see the wisdom of god clearly manifested in a minute point swammerdam identified the worker bees as '' natural eunuchs '' because he was unable to detect ovaries in them , but described them as nearer to the nature of the female swammerdam played a key role in the debunking of the balloonist theory , the idea that 'moving spirits ' are responsible for muscle contractions in the model , which descartes used to explain reflexes , the spirits would flow from the brain ventricle , through the nerves , and to the muscles to animate the latter to test this idea , swammerdam placed severed frog thigh muscle in an airtight syringe with a small amount of water in the tip he could thus determine whether there was a change in the volume of the muscle when it contracted by observing a change in the level of the water ( image at right ) when swammerdam caused the muscle to contract by irritating the nerve , the water level did not rise but rather was lowered by a minute amount ; this showed that no air or fluid could be flowing into the muscle steno sent malpighi the drawings swammerdam had done of the experiments , saying '' when he had written a treatise on this matter he destroyed it and he has only preserved these figures though swammerdam 's work on insects and anatomy was significant , many current histories remember him as much for his methods and skill with microscopes as for his discoveries but swammerdam has also been credited with heralding the natural theology of the 18th century , were god 's grand design was detected in the mechanics of the solar system , the seasons , snowflakes and the anatomy of the human eye '' the early enlightenment in the dutch republic , 1650–1750 : selected papers of a conference , held at the herzog august bibliothek wolfenbüttel , 22–23 march 2001 site devoted to swammerdam short biography from a website that chronicles the '' rocky road to modern paleontology and biology '' biography written by matthew cobb , a professor at laboratoire d'ecologie in paris an english edition of swammerdam 's '' the book of nature , or , the history of insects '' from the history of science digital collection : utah state university the correspondence of jan swammerdam in emlo
