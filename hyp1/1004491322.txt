a dvd player has to complete these tasks : read a dvd in iso – udf version 1.02 format optionally decrypt the data with either css and/or macrovision read and obey the dvds regional lockout codes and display a warning if the player is not authorized to play the dvd decode the mpeg-2 video stream with a maximum of 10 mbit/s ( peak ) or 8 mbit/s ( continuous ) decode sound in mp2 , pcm or ac-3 format and output ( with optional ac-3 to stereo downmixing ) on stereo connector , optical or electric digital connector output a video signal , either an analog one ( in ntsc or pal format ) on the composite , s-video , scart , or component video connectors , or a digital one on the dvi or hdmi connectors in the battle to succeed and to improve upon the role of the dvd player as the mainstream medium for stored audiovisual content on optical disc , there were two major contestants : the hd dvd player and the blu-ray disc player , utilizing two incompatible technologies that reproduced higher resolution video images and more complete audio information than was possible with dvd in europe ( but not most other pal areas ) , scart connectors are generally used , which can carry composite and analog rgb interlaced video signals ( rgb can be progressive , but not all dvd players and displays support this mode ) or y/c ( s-video ) , as well as analog two-channel sound and automatic 4:3 or 16:9 ( widescreen ) switching on a single convenient multi-wire cable among others , there are variants & huge kinds of software dvd players as well as multimedia player software which has dvd video playback capability , whether its proprietary-type ( as commercial software ) , freeware , shareware or just a free software are available in the market by no means , however , will the resulting signal be high-definition video ; that is , aside from optional deinterlacing , upconverting generally consists of merely scaling the video 's dimensions to match that of higher resolution formats , foregoing the scaling that would normally occur in the output device the connectors are further confused by using a number of different physical connectors on different player models , rca or bnc , as well as using vga cables in a non-standard way ( vga is normally analog rgb & mdash ; a different , incompatible form of component video ) these producers have to pay us 15– 20 per player in license fees , to the patent holders of the dvd technology ( sony , philips , toshiba and time warner ) as well as for mpeg-2 licenses however , neither connector was intended to be used for progressive video , and most later players sold then gained another set of connectors , component video , which keeps the three components of the video , luminance and two color differentials , on fully separate wires as technology improved , various players were sold , some of which were also blu-ray players , that could upscale and up-convert dvd content , increasing the overall perceived picture quality . the physical connection is typically rca connectors or toslink , which transmits a s/pdif stream carrying either uncompressed digital audio ( pcm ) or the original compressed audio data ( dolby digital , dts , mpeg audio ) to be decoded by the audio equipment
