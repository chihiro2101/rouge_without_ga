the german empire was abolished and a democratic system , the weimar republic , was established in 1919 by the weimar national assembly in 1919–20 , the government of germany was formed by the weimar coalition , consisting of the social democratic party ( spd ) , german democratic party ( ddp , left-of-centre liberals ) , and zentrum ( conservative catholics ) the treaty had been dictated by the victorious allies of world war i ; it forced germany to assume sole responsibility for the war , reduced the area of germany and imposed reparation payments and military restrictions on the nation in early 1919 , the strength of the reichswehr , the regular german army , was estimated at 350,000 , with more than 250,000 men enlisted in the various freikorps ( '' free corps '' ) , volunteer paramilitary units , largely consisting of returning soldiers from the war thumb although the putsch has been named after wolfgang kapp , a 62-year-old nationalist east prussian civil servant , who had been planning a coup against the republic for a while , it was instigated by the military ; kapp played a supporting role general walther von lüttwitz , in command of all the regular troops in and around berlin ( gruppenkommando i ) , the highest ranking general in the army at the time and in command of many freikorps , said at the parade that he would '' not accept '' the loss of such an important unit lüttwitz , drawing on demands by the right-wing parties and adding his own , now demanded the immediate dissolution of the national assembly , new elections for the reichstag , the appointment of technocrats ( fachminister ) as secretaries for foreign affairs , economic affairs and finance , the dismissal of general reinhardt , appointment of himself as supreme commander of the regular army and the revocation of the orders of dissolution for the marinebrigaden these included german national people 's party ( dnvp ) member wolfgang kapp , retired general erich ludendorff and waldemar pabst , who had been behind the murder of karl liebknecht and rosa luxemburg in january 1919 and , the last berlin head of police in the old reich on the evening of 12 march , ehrhardt ordered his brigade to march into berlin , to '' ruthlessly break any resistance '' ( jeden widerstand rücksichtslos zu brechen ) and to occupy the centre of the city with the government buildings others have quoted seeckt 's words as the even more succinct : '' reichswehr does not fire on reichswehr ! '' noske , depressed enough by the disloyalty of the military to speak about suicide to an aide , reported to the cabinet at 4:00 & nbsp ; am at a confused meeting at the reichskanzlei , the undefended cabinet took two decisions : to flee the city and to issue a call for a general strike these were not unanimous , the vice-chancellor eugen schiffer and some of the other non-spd ministers refused to leave the city , to preserve the opportunity to negotiate with the putschists thumb there was no military resistance to the putsch ; the regular troops in berlin , sicherheitspolizei , navy , the army commands of east-prussia , pomerania , brandenburg and silesia , formally accepted the new minister of defence and reichskanzler the cabinet proclamation on 13 march , calling on german workers to defeat the putsch by means of a general strike met with enormous success and received massive support from the working class the majority unions , sympathetic to the government dominated by spd , joined the call for a strike on the same day , as did the independent social democratic party ( uspd ) and the democratic party ; the communist party of germany ( kpd ) followed one day later adolf hitler , who had been in contact with the members of the nationale vereinigung and was eager to help the coup along , was flown into berlin from munich by the army proclamations asking the workers to return to their jobs , promises of new elections and even the threat of capital punishment for strikers remained without results and the putsch collapsed on 17 march , four days after it had begun the four parties , supported by some social democrats who had remained in berlin , offered fresh elections , a cabinet reshuffle and an amnesty for all participants in the putsch , if kapp and lüttwitz were to resign they suggested to schiffer , in the absence of ebert in charge of the government 's affairs , that he appoint seeckt as head of the reichswehr , which schiffer did in the name of ebert on 18 march , seeckt praised the discipline of the marinebrigade ehrhardt and the next day provided ehrhardt with a written promise that he would not be arrested as long as he was in command of the brigade and the brigade left berlin the sign reads : '' for peace , freedom and democracy & nbsp ; — in memory of the suppression of the kapp putsch in march 1920 '' in 2009 , layton wrote , '' at first sight the collapse of the kapp putsch could be viewed as a major success for the weimar republic in the six days of crisis , it had retained the backing of the people of berlin and had effectively withstood a major threat from the extreme right '' among the grievances which kapp and his followers had against the government were that the national assembly , which had been elected to serve temporarily , was beginning to act as a permanent reichstag and that it seemed this assembly might revise the constitution with respect to the election of the president of the republic , which would make the reichstag , rather than the electorate , responsible for the presidential election as a consequence of the promise made to the putschists , the national assembly was dissolved in april and the date of the general election for the first republican reichstag was brought forward to 6 june so that the german people could express their feelings regarding the terms of the versailles treaty in the german federal election , 1920 , the number of votes cast for the spd and the democratic party fell by more than half , compared to the january 1919 elections , while the extreme right-wing german national people 's party ( dnvp ) ( whose voters eventually switched to the nazis ) and the extreme left-wing uspd gained substantially ebert told the army it was free to arrange its own affairs , thereby forming a state-within-a-state implacably opposed to weimar that eventually was central to the right-wing coup against the prussian state government ( half of german territory ) in 1932 the unions ( adgb , afa-bund and dbb ) demanded the creation of a new government made up of spd and uspd , led by carl legien but only a new government based on the weimar coalition found a majority in the national assembly and hermann müller ( spd ) replaced bauer as chancellor as in 1918–1919 , those on the left had cause to accuse the spd and the ebert government of siding with the enemies of the workers and of the republic the putsch left a rump of military conspirators such as pabst and ehrhardt , who found refuge in bavaria under the right-wing government of gustav von kahr ( itself an indirect product of the kapp-lüttwitz putsch ) and there attempted to organize plots against the republican constitution and government of germany most of the participants were granted an amnesty and on 2 august 1920 , the reichstag passed a law that exculpated crimes committed during the putsch and the subsequent ruhr uprising except those due to '' cruelty '' or '' self-interest '' gustav noske was forced to resign by the unions on 22 march , as a condition for ending the general strike and because some in the spd thought that he had not been tough enough facing up to the putschists ; otto gessler succeeded noske as defence minister image : monument to the march dead.jpg thumb monument to the march dead , by walter gropius between 1920 and 1922 a monument in honour of the workers who were killed in the wake of the kapp putsch was erected in the weimar central cemetery
