mankind in the american heritage dictionary sometimes the same components as those of a compound word are used in a descriptive phrase with a different meaning and with stress on both words , but that descriptive phrase is then not usually considered a compound : bláck bírd ( any bird that is black ) and bláckbird ( a common blackbird ) and páper bág ( a bag made of paper ) and páper bag ( very rarely used to mean a bag for carrying newspapers but is often also used to mean a bag made of paper ) these particular distinguishing features of stress , or types of prominence in which particular features are dominant , are sometimes referred to as particular types of accent – dynamic accent in the case of loudness , pitch accent in the case of pitch ( although that term usually has more specialized meanings ) , quantitative accent in the case of length , and qualitative accent in the case of differences in articulation the effect may be dependent on lexical stress ( for example , the unstressed first syllable of the word photographer contains a schwa , whereas the stressed first syllable of photograph does not , or on prosodic stress ( for example , the word of is pronounced with a schwa when it is unstressed within a sentence , but not when it is stressed ) french words are sometimes said to be stressed on the final syllable , but that can be attributed to the prosodic stress that is placed on the last syllable ( unless it is a schwa , when stress is placed on the second-last syllable ) of any string of words in that language ) a course in phonetics § & nbsp ; 5.4 ; ( 1980 ) preliminaries to linguistic phonetics p 83 they find that the multiple levels posited for english , whether primary–secondary or primary–secondary–tertiary , are not phonetic stress ( let alone phoneme ) , and that the supposed secondary/tertiary stress is not characterized by the increase in respiratory activity associated with primary/secondary stress in english and other languages that is , if a word is written without an accent mark , the stress is on the penult if the last letter is a vowel , n , or s , but on the final syllable if the word ends in any other letter in english , it is not fully predictable , but the different secondary stress of the words organization and accumulation ( on the first and second syllable , respectively ) is predictable due to the same stress of the verbs órganize and accúmulate some languages , such as english , are said to be stress-timed languages ; that is , stressed syllables appear at a roughly constant rate and non-stressed syllables are shortened to accommodate that , which contrasts with languages that have syllable timing ( e.g an example of a natural prosodic stress pattern is that described for french above ; stress is placed on the final syllable of a string of words ( or if that is a schwa , the next-to-final syllable ) for instance , the english word laboratory is stressed on the second syllable in british english ( labóratory often pronounced '' labóratry '' , the second o being silent ) , but the first syllable in american english , with a secondary stress on the '' tor ' syllable ( láboratory often pronounced '' lábratory '' ) in some analyses , for example the one found in chomsky and halle 's the sound pattern of english , english has been described as having four levels of stress : primary , secondary , tertiary , and quaternary , but the treatments often disagree with one another the position of lexical stress in a word may depend on certain general rules applicable in the language or dialect in question , but in other languages , it must be learned for each word , as it is largely unpredictable for example , the english words insight and incite are distinguished in pronunciation only by the fact that the stress falls on the first syllable in the former and on the second syllable in the latter ( the acute accent is also used on some monosyllables in order to distinguish homographs , as in ( '' the '' ) and ( '' or '' ) ; here the stress of the two words is the same a similar pattern is found in english ( see above ) : the traditional distinction between ( lexical ) primary and secondary stress is replaced partly by a prosodic rule stating that the final stressed syllable in a phrase is given additional stress statements about the position of stress are sometimes affected by the fact that when a word is spoken in isolation , prosodic factors ( see below ) come into play , which do not apply when the word is spoken normally within a sentence the explanation is that spanish has lexically contrastive stress , as evidenced by the minimal pairs like ( '' mole '' ) and ( '' he/she/it met '' ) , while in french , stress does not convey lexical information and there is no equivalent of stress minimal pairs as in spanish in portuguese , stress is sometimes indicated explicitly with an acute accent ( for i , u , and open a , e , o ) , or circumflex ( for close a , e , o ) in dutch , ad hoc indication of stress is usually marked by an acute accent on the vowel ( or , in the case of a diphthong or double vowel , the first two vowels ) of the stressed syllable ( a word spoken alone becomes such a phrase , hence such prosodic stress may appear to be lexical if the pronunciation of words is analyzed in a standalone context rather than within phrases in some cases , classes of words in a language differ in their stress properties ; for example , loanwords into a language with fixed stress may preserve stress placement from the source language , or the sezer stress though not part of normal orthography , a number of devices exist that are used by linguists and others to indicate the position of stress ( and syllabification in some cases ) when it is desirable to do so greenberg , automatic transcription of prosodic stress for spontaneous english discourse , proceedings of the xivth international congress of phonetic sciences ( icphs99 ) , san francisco , ca , august 1999 , pages 2351–2354 they may also have a different fundamental frequency , or other properties other languages have stress placed on different syllables but in a predictable way , as in classical arabic and latin , where stress is conditioned by the structure of particular syllables in general texts , stress marks are rare , typically used either when required for disambiguation of homographs ( compare – '' in great quantities '' , and – '' in great er quantities '' ) , or in rare words and names that are likely to be mispronounced in some languages , such as spanish , portuguese , lakota and , to some extent , italian , stress is even represented in writing using diacritical marks , for example in the spanish words and most often , the cantillation mark oleh ( part of oleh ve-yored ) , which looks like a left-pointing arrow above the consonant of the stressed syllable , for example bóker ( morning ) as opposed to bokér ( cowboy ) in the international phonetic alphabet ( ipa ) , primary stress is indicated by a high vertical line ( primary stress mark : ) before the stressed element , secondary stress by a low vertical line ( secondary stress mark : ) in some contexts , the term stress or stress accent is used to mean specifically dynamic accent ( or as an antonym to pitch accent in its various meanings )
