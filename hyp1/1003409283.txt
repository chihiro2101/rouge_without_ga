in what are presumed to be the oldest versions , the same melody is repeated for the first eight iterations , and a variation used on the final line ( that is , formally , aaa aaa aaa ' ) in fact , because of the late date of most kyries , it is not always clear whether a particular kyrie melody or the apparently troped text came first ; it could just as easily be the case that a melisma song was converted into a melisma for a kyrie verse as the kyrie is the first item in settings of the mass ordinary and the second in the requiem mass ( the only mass proper set regularly over the centuries ) , nearly all of the thousands of composers over the centuries who have set the ordinaries of the mass to music have included a kyrie movement many have a ternary ( aba ) form known as a three-fold kyrie , where the two appearances of the phrase '' kyrie eleison '' consist of identical or closely related material and frame a contrasting '' christe eleison '' section in mass settings ( normally in english ) composed for the church of england 's book of common prayer liturgy , the gloria is commonly the last movement , because it occurs in this position in the text of the service organizers of international celebrations , such as world youth day , have been encouraged by rome to familiarize congregants in the latin chants for the our father and the credo , specifically credo iii ( 17th century , fifth mode ) from the missa de angelis the purpose of singing these two texts in latin is to engender a sense of unity in the faithful , all of whom thus sing the prayer of jesus and the shared belief of the universal church in the same language the agnus dei is a setting of the '' lamb of god '' litany , containing the responses miserere nobis ( have mercy upon us ) , repeated twice , and dona nobis pacem ( grant us peace ) once at the end masses containing only a setting of the kyrie and the gloria ) , or a mass containing all these parts , but relatively short in duration , or a mass in a setting that is less extended in vocal and orchestral forces than that of a neapolitan mass mozart described it thus in a letter he wrote in 1776 ( '' the archbishop '' in this quotation refers to colloredo ) : walter senn , nma series i : geistliche gesangwerke , group i ( masses and requiem ) , division i : masses , volume 2 , preface , pp thus , '' mass for the period of ( advent and ) lent '' indicates a mass composition without music for the gloria the sixth and last part of the ordinarium ( either ite , missa est , or , in masses without gloria , benedicamus domino ) is usually not set as part of a mass composition in a tridentine mass that part of the ordinarium is usually spoken , or sung to the gregorian melody provided in the roman missal , although early polyphonic settings for the '' deo gratias '' response ( e.g the proper of the mass is usually not set to music in a mass itself , except in the case of a requiem mass , but may be the subject of motets or other musical compositions these sections , the '' proper '' of the mass , change with the day and season according to the church calendar , or according to the special circumstances of the mass the sections of the proper of the mass include the introit , gradual , alleluia or tract ( depending on the time of year ) , offertory and communion the different portions of the ordinary came into the liturgy at different times , with the kyrie probably being first ( perhaps as early as the 7th century ) and the credo being last ( it did not become part of the roman mass until 1014 ) the reason for this surge in interest is not known , but it has been suggested that there was a shortage of new music since composers were increasingly attracted to secular music , and overall interest in writing sacred music had entered a period of decline several anonymous complete masses from the 14th century survive , including the tournai mass ; however , discrepancies in style indicate that the movements of these masses were written by several composers and later compiled by scribes into a single set complete masses by a single composer were the norm by the middle of the 15th century , and the form of the mass , with the possibilities for large-scale structure inherent in its multiple movement format , was the main focus of composers within the area of sacred music ; it was not to be eclipsed until the motet and related forms became more popular in the first decades of the 16th century other techniques for organizing the cyclic mass evolved by the beginning of the 16th century , including the paraphrase technique , in which the cantus firmus was elaborated and ornamented , and the parody technique , in which several voices of a polyphonic source , not just one , were incorporated into the texture of the mass sometimes these masses were named for other things , such as palestrina 's famous missa papae marcelli , the mass of pope marcellus , and many times they were canonic masses , as in missa sine nomine ( josquin ) at the end of the 16th century , prominent representatives of a cappella choral counterpoint included the englishman william byrd , the castilian tomás luis de victoria and the roman giovanni pierluigi da palestrina , whose mass for pope marcellus is sometimes credited with saving polyphony from the censure of the council of trent by the time of palestrina , however , most composers outside of rome were using other forms for their primary creative outlet for expression in the realm of sacred music , principally the motet and the madrigale spirituale ; composers such as the members of the venetian school preferred the possibilities inherent in the new forms the early baroque era initiated stylistic changes which led to increasing disparity between masses written entirely in the traditional polyphonic manner ( stile antico ) , whose principal advancements were the use of the basso continuo and the gradual adoption of a wider harmonic vocabulary , and the mass in modern style with solo voices and instrumental obbligatos the lutheran michael praetorius composed a mass for double choir in the old style , which he published in 1611 in the collection of church music for the mass in latin , missodia sionia after the renaissance , the mass tended not to be the central genre for any one composer , yet among the most famous works of the baroque , classical , and romantic periods are settings of the ordinary of the mass many of the famous masses of the romantic era were requiems , one of the most famous , a german requiem by brahms , being the composer 's own selection of biblical texts rather than a setting of a standard liturgy among the masses written in these eras are : messa concertata by cavalli ( 1656 ) mass for double choir , from missodia sionia , by michael praetorius ( 1611 ) missa assumpta est maria : missa sex vocibus cum simphonia h 11 & h 11 a ( 1699 ? ) by marc-antoine charpentier , and 11 others masses , h 1 , h 2 ( pour les trépassés ) , h 3 , h 4 ( for 4 chorus ) , h 5 , h 6 , h 7 , h 8 , h9 , h 10 , h 513 bach '' high masses '' by czech baroque composer jan dismas zelenka requiem by jean gilles mass for double choir and double orchestra by henry desmarest mass of requiem by andré campra 1723 requiem , ( great mass for dead people ) by françois-joseph gossec 1760 18 masses by wolfgang amadeus mozart , including the great mass in c minor ( 1782 ) and requiem 14 masses by joseph haydn , including nelson mass and mass in time of war mass in c major and missa solemnis in d major by beethoven mass in g major and 5 others by schubert missa choralis and hungarian coronation mass by liszt requiem by hector berlioz 1837 mass in d minor , mass in e minor and mass in f minor by bruckner requiem by camille saint-saëns 1878 st the revival of choral celebration of holy communion in the anglican church in the late 19th century marked the beginning several liturgical settings of mass texts in english , particularly for choir and organ the movement for liturgical reform has resulted in revised forms of the mass , making it more functional by using a variety of accessible styles , popular or ethnic , and using new methods such as refrain and response to encourage congregational involvement nevertheless , the mass in its musical incarnation continues to thrive beyond the walls of the church , as is evident in many of the 21st-century masses listed here which were composed for concert performance rather than in service of the roman rite these are more often known as 'communion services ' , and differ not only in that they are settings of english words , but also , as mentioned above , in that the gloria usually forms the last movement since the texts of the 'benedictus qui venit ' and the 'agnus dei ' do not actually feature in the liturgy of the 1662 book of common prayer , these movements are often missing from some of the earlier anglican settings with reforms in the anglican liturgy , the movements are now usually sung in the same order that they are in the roman catholic rite well known anglican settings of the mass , which may be found in the repertoire of many english cathedrals are : darke in f darke in e darke in a minor ireland in c stanford in c & f stanford in b flat stanford in a sumsion in f oldroyd , mass of the quiet hour jackson in g howells , collegium regale leighton in d noble in b minor harwood in a flat wood in the phrygian mode
