the stg originally reported to the goddard space flight center organization , with a total staff of 45 , including 37 engineers , and eight secretaries and human computer ( women who ran calculations on mechanical adding machines ) keith glennan , realized that the growth of the us space program would cause the stg to outgrow the langley and goddard centers and require its own location kennedy set the goal to put a person on the moon by the end of the decade , it became clear gilruth would need a larger organization to lead the apollo program , with new test facilities and research laboratories these included : access to water transport by large barges , a moderate climate , availability of all-weather commercial jet service , a well-established industrial complex with supporting technical facilities and labor , close proximity to a culturally attractive community in the vicinity of an institution of higher education , a strong electric utility and water supply , at least of land , and certain specified cost parameters the team initially came up with a list of 22 cities based on the climate and water criteria , then cut this to a short list of nine with nearby federal facilities : jacksonville , florida ( green cove springs naval air station ) tampa , florida ( macdill air force base ) baton rouge , louisiana shreveport , louisiana ( barksdale air force base ) houston , texas ( san jacinto ordnance depot ) victoria , texas ( victoria regional airport ) corpus christi , texas ( naval air station corpus christi ) san diego , california ( camp elliott ) san francisco , california ( benicia arsenal ) another 14 sites were then added , including two additional houston sites chosen because of proximity to the university of houston and rice university webb informed president kennedy on september 14 of the decision made by him and deputy administrator hugh dryden in two separate memoranda , one reviewing the criteria and procedures , and the other stating : '' our decision is that this laboratory should be located in houston , texas , in close association with rice university and the other educational institutions there and in that region '' the land for the new facility was donated to rice by the humble oil company , situated in an undeveloped area southeast of houston adjacent to clear lake near galveston bay immediately after webb 's announcement , gilruth and his staff began planning the move from langley to houston , using what would grow to of leased office and laboratory space in 11 scattered sites construction of the center , designed by charles luckman , began in april 1962 , and gilruth 's new organization was formed and moved to the temporary locations by september the speech is famous for highlighting the apollo program , but kennedy also made reference to the new center : the facility was officially opened for business in september 1963 in 1961 , as plans for project gemini began , it became increasingly clear that the mercury control center located at the cape canaveral air force station launch center would become inadequate to control missions with maneuverable spacecraft such as gemini and apollo philco bid on and won the contract to build the electronic equipment for the new mission control center , which would be located in building 30 of msc rather than canaveral or the goddard space flight center in maryland it was brought online for testing purposes during the uncrewed gemini 2 flight in january 1965 and the first crewed gemini flight , gemini 3 in march 1965 , though the mercury control center still retained primary responsibility for control of these flights it became fully operational for the flight of gemini 4 the following june , and has been the primary flight control center for all subsequent us crewed space missions from project gemini forward in addition to housing nasa 's astronaut operations , jsc is also the site of the former lunar receiving laboratory , where the first astronauts returning from the moon were quarantined , and where the majority of lunar samples are stored on february 19 , 1973 , after johnson 's death , president richard nixon signed into law a senate resolution renaming the manned spacecraft center in honor of johnson , who as senate majority leader had sponsored the national aeronautics and space act image : columbia makeshift memorial.jpg thumb entrance to jsc on february 1 , 2003 , with a makeshift memorial to the victims of the space shuttle columbia disaster in the wake of the january 28 , 1986 , space shuttle challenger disaster , president ronald reagan and first lady nancy reagan traveled to jsc on january 31 to speak at a memorial service honoring the astronauts a similar memorial service was held at the johnson space center on february 4 , 2003 , for the astronauts who perished in the space shuttle columbia disaster three days before , which was attended by president george w jsc handles most of the planning and training of the us astronaut corps and houses training facilities such as the sonny carter training facility and the neutral buoyancy laboratory , a critical component in training astronauts for spacewalks the center is also responsible for direction of operations at white sands test facility in new mexico , which served as a backup space shuttle landing site and would have been the coordinating facility for the constellation program , which was planned to replace the shuttle program after 2010 , but was canceled in 2009 the extension will allow a continuation of biomedical research in support of a long-term human presence in space started by the institute and nasa 's human research program through 2012 the prebreathe reduction program is a research study program at the jsc that is currently being developed to improve the safety and efficiency of space walks from the international space station
