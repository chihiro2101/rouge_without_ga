the popularity of the work , and its heroic scale , meant that it was often used as a set piece on celebratory occasions ; on 15 & nbsp ; march 2008 , yoav talmi led 200 instrumentalists and a choir of 800 in a performance in quebec city , to mark the 400th anniversary of the city 's foundation two notes in mahler 's handwriting dating from june 1906 show that early schemes for the work , which he may not at first have intended as a fully choral symphony , were based on a four-movement structure in which two '' hymns '' surround an instrumental core he soon replaced the last three movements with a single section , essentially a dramatic cantata , based on the closing scenes of goethe 's faust , the depiction of an ideal of redemption through eternal womanhood ( das ewige-weibliche ) the first note is as follows : hymn : veni creator scherzo adagio : caritas ( '' christian love '' ) hymn : die geburt des eros ( '' the birth of eros '' ) the second note includes musical sketches for the veni creator movement , and two bars in b minor which are thought to relate to the caritas to cooke , mahler 's is '' the choral symphony of the twentieth century : like beethoven 's , but in a different way , it sets before us an ideal of redemption which we are as yet far from realising—even perhaps moving away from—but which we can hardly abandon without perishing '' 102 mahler 's recollection , however , is that on the first day of the vacation he was seized by the creative spirit , and plunged immediately into composition of the work that would become his eighth symphony the years after world war ii saw a number of notable performances of the eighth symphony , including sir adrian boult 's broadcast from the royal albert hall on 10 & nbsp ; february 1948 , the japanese premiere under kazuo yamada in tokyo in december 1949 , and the australian premiere under sir eugene goossens in 1951 he told specht that having chanced on the veni creator hymn , he had a sudden vision of the complete work : '' i saw the whole piece immediately before my eyes , and only needed to write it down as though it were being dictated to me '' the austrian music historian oscar bie , while impressed with the festival as a whole , wrote subsequently that the eighth was '' stronger in effect than in significance , and purer in its voices than in emotion '' 358 langford had commented on the british '' not being very eager about mahler '' , and the eighth symphony was not performed in britain until 15 & nbsp ; april 1930 , when henry wood presented it with the bbc symphony orchestra the eighth symphony 's two parts combine the sacred text of the 9th-century latin hymn veni creator spiritus with the secular text from the closing passages from goethe 's 19th-century dramatic poem faust a succession of premieres in the far east culminated in october 2002 in beijing , when long yu led the china philharmonic orchestra in the first performance of the work in the people 's republic of china he characterises the alto solos as brief and unremarkable ; however , the tenor solo role in part & nbsp ; ii is both extensive and demanding , requiring on several occasions to be heard over the choruses in london on 16 & nbsp ; july 2010 the opening concert of the bbc proms celebrated the 150th anniversary of mahler 's birth with a performance of the eighth , with jiří bělohlávek conducting the bbc symphony orchestra the occasion was a great success ; the symphony was played several more times in philadelphia before the orchestra and choruses travelled to new york , for a series of equally well-received performances at the metropolitan opera house this vast hall had a capacity of 3,200 ; to assist ticket sales and raise publicity , gutmann devised the nickname '' symphony of a thousand '' , which has remained the symphony 's popular subtitle despite mahler 's disapproval back at his hotel mahler received a letter from thomas mann , which referred to the composer as '' the man who , as i believe , expresses the art of our time in its profoundest and most sacred form '' 77 mahler had long nurtured an ambition to set the end of the faust epic to music , '' and to set it quite differently from other composers who have made it saccharine and feeble 151 mahler had no doubts about the ground-breaking nature of the symphony , calling it the grandest thing he had ever done , and maintaining that all his previous symphonies were merely preludes to it at the amsterdam mahler festival in may 1920 , mahler 's completed symphonies and his major song cycles were presented over nine concerts given by the concertgebouw orchestra and choruses , under mengelberg 's direction 523–524 the choice of these two texts was not arbitrary ; goethe , a poet whom mahler revered , believed that veni creator embodied aspects of his own philosophy , and had translated it into german in 1820 241 the music critic samuel langford , who attended the occasion , commented that '' we do not leave amsterdam greatly envying the diet of mahler first and every other composer afterward , to which mengelberg is training the music-lovers of that city 222 these included the dutch premiere , in amsterdam under willem mengelberg on 12 & nbsp ; march 1912 , and the first prague performance , given on 20 & nbsp ; march 1912 under mahler 's former vienna hofoper colleague , alexander von zemlinsky 186 this most affirmative work of mahler 's is , in adorno 's view , his least successful , musically and artistically inferior to his other symphonies & nbsp ;
