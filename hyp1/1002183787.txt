according to the book of mormon , the family of lehi , described as a wealthy hebrew prophet ; the family of ishmael ; and zoram traveled from the middle east to the americas by boat in around 600 & nbsp ; bc some time after the death of lehi in the americas , nephi , a son of lehi , was concerned that his brothers , laman and lemuel , were plotting to kill him and so he , his family , and his followers left and went into the wilderness the book of mormon describes the animosity that the lamanites held : believing that they were driven out of the land of jerusalem because of the iniquities of their fathers , and that they were wronged in the wilderness by their brethren , and they were also wronged while crossing the sea ; and again , that they were wronged while in the land of their first inheritance , after they had crossed the sea ( mosiah 10:12â€“13 ) the book of mormon also recounts that the lamanites felt that they were wronged specifically by nephi and so swore vengeance against his descendants : the lamanites were wroth with him nephi because he departed into the wilderness as the lord had commanded him , and took the records which were engraven on the plates of brass , for they said that he robbed them the book of mormon further recounts , '' there were no robbers , nor murderers , neither were there lamanites , nor any manner of -ites ; but they were in one , the children of christ , and heirs to the kingdom of god the doctrine and covenants also contains a prophecy that the lamanites will '' blossom as a rose '' ( d & c 49:24 ) and that the city of zion would be built on the borders by the lamanites ( d & c 28:9 ) , which was later identified as missouri ( d & c 54:8 ) book of mormon ( lds church edition ) , '' introduction '' in the 21st & nbsp ; century , mormon scholars who favor a limited geography model have disclaimed a primary genetic connection between the lamanites and indigenous american peoples however , the matter remains unsettled while the field of dna ancestry continues to develop , and many latter day saints believe that the lamanites comprise some part , if not the primary origin , of native americans by stating that the lamanites '' are among the ancestors of the american indians some mormon scholars now view lamanites as either & nbsp ; one small tribe among many in the ancient americas , the remainder of which are not discussed in the book of mormon ; & nbsp ; a & nbsp ; tribe that intermarried with indigenous native americans ; or & nbsp ; a & nbsp ; tribe that descended with modern asians from common nomadic ancestry but diverged before lehi 's departure from jerusalem in the book of mormon , lamanites are described as having received a '' skin of blackness '' to distinguish them from the nephites kimball suggested that the skin of latter-day saint native american was gradually turning lighter : that view was buoyed by passages such as 2 & nbsp ; nephi 30:6 , which in early editions of the book of mormon , read : '' their scales of darkness shall begin to fall from their eyes ; and many generations shall not pass away among them , save they shall be a white and a delightsome people '' in 1840 , with the third edition of the book of mormon , the founder of the latter day saint movement , joseph smith , who adherents believe translated the writings of ancient prophets to become the book of mormon , changed the wording to '' a pure and a delightsome people , '' consistent with contemporary interpretation of the term '' white '' as used in scripture within the first 200 & nbsp ; years of the nephites ' 1,000 & nbsp ; year chronology , the prophet jacob stated that any who were enemies of his people were called lamanites and that any who were friends were called nephites : '' but i , jacob , shall not hereafter distinguish them by these names , but i shall call them lamanites that seek to destroy the people of nephi , and those who are friendly to nephi i shall call nephites , or the people of nephi , according to the reigns of the kings '' the phrase '' skin of blackness '' and the passage was changed to '' because of their unbelief , the lamanites are cut off from the presence of the lord , are cursed , and become a scourge unto the nephites on the other hand , some believers in the book of mormon , such as marvin perkins , see the changes as better conforming the chapter headers and footnotes to the meaning of the text in light of the lds church 's 1978 revelation on priesthood
