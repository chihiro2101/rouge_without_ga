the oxford guide to heraldry cites a late-14th century english treatise as stating that in addition to the two metals and five colours , a colour called tawny was '' borne only in the empire and france , '' the oxford guide also citing gerard leigh 's the accendance of armory ( 1562 ) as rejecting tenné or tawny as non-existent and sanguine or murrey as mistaken purpure it is to be a light brown color , bright enough to be distinguished from the darkest heraldic colour , sable ( black ) , as well as the darker brown color brunâtre , used for bear hide fur specifically , the arms of lamorlaye have a field tinctured orangé ( in french ) , the arms of margny-lès-compiègne have a divided field which is partly tinctured orangé as well as a charge in chief which is also orangé , and the arms of la neuville-roy has a quarter tinctured tanné ( in french ) ; all of these are communes in the department of oise ; see them listed at armorial of the communes of oise-3 ( i-p ) arthur charles fox-davies , in his complete guide to heraldry , asserted that both tenné and murrey were probably inventions of the theoretical ( though never shown in actual practice ) system of abatements , further commenting that he knew of only one instance of tenné to date ( as of 1909 ) , and that was in an estate livery rather than coat armory to this , woodward was able to add the standards of both the earl of derby , bearing the stanley crest upon a field of tawny and vert , and the earl of northumberland , bearing '' four horizontal bands , the upper being russet , the two central ones yellow , and the lowest tawny in the oxford english dictionary , tenné is described as '' orange-brown , as a stain used in blazoning '' , and as a mid-16th-century variant of old french tané military units , particularly in the signal corps , where the colour is shown as a bright shade of orange , and the cavalry , where tenné is sometimes called '' dragoon yellow '' orange is a common colour in south african heraldry , because of the history of south africa as a dutch colony , and the fact that royal house of the netherlands is the house of orange the 1st cavalry was founded as the regiment of united states dragoons in 1833 , and at the time the dragoon units wore a cord of tenné ( which they called '' dragoon yellow '' ) and or ( gold ) '' fox-davies suggested that orange , as it appears in german heraldry , may be a different colour than tenné , noting that a different hatching is associated with german orange than that of british tenné as such , in french ( and most of continental ) heraldry , tenné is the light-brownish colour that leather is supposed to have once tanned the dutch prince 's flag was an orange white and blue tricolour , and this was the basis of the flags of the orange free state ( 1857-1902 ) and the flag of south africa ( 1928-1994 )
