when 1908 passed with no serious attempt being made , the offer was renewed for the year of 1909 , with the prize money doubled to £1,000 like some of the other prizes offered , it was widely seen as nothing more than a way to gain cheap publicity for the paper : the paris newspaper le matin commenting that there was no chance of the prize being won three days later , on 19 july , he informed the daily mail of his intention to make an attempt to win the thousand-pound prize offered by the paper for a successful crossing of the english channel in a heavier-than-air aircraft us centennial of flight commission : louis blériot louis charles-joseph blériot flight and plane information ( photos and videos ) '' a daring flight '' - homepage of the nova tv episode louis blériot memorial behind dover castle uk louis blériot and wife at house of commons , after channel crossing ( by john benjamin stone ) view footage of blériot 's flight in 1909 '' seadromes ! says blériot , '' popular mechanics , october 1935 , one of the last interviews given by blériot before his death the disappointment of the failure of his aircraft was compounded by the success of alberto santos dumont later that day , when he managed to fly his 14-bis a distance of , winning the aéro club de france prize for the first flight of over 100 metres at 4:15 am , 25 july , watched by an excited crowd , blériot made a short trial flight in his type xi , and then , on a signal that the sun had risen ( the competition rules required a flight between sunrise and sunset ) , he took off at 4:41 to attempt the crossing this was shortly followed by the blériot xii , a high-wing two-seater monoplane first flown on 21 may , and for a while blériot concentrated on flying this machine , flying it with a passenger on 2 july , and on 12 july making the world 's first flight with two passengers , one of whom was santos dumont at the end of july he took part in an aviation meet at douai , where he made a flight lasting over 47 minutes in the type xii on 3 july : the following day he flew the type xi for 50 minutes at another meet at juvisy , and on 13 july , he made a cross-country flight of from etampes to orléans once over land , blériot circled twice to lose height , and cut his engine at an altitude of about , making a heavy '' pancake '' landing due to the gusty wind conditions ; the undercarriage was damaged and one blade of the propeller was shattered , but blériot was unhurt three of his aircraft were displayed at the first paris aero salon , held at the end of december : the blériot ix monoplane ; the blériot x , a three-seat pusher biplane ; and the blériot xi , which would go on to be his most successful model although it was the first to use of a successful combination of hand/arm-operated joystick and foot-operated rudder control , this was a failure in its first form the first two of the designs , which used antoinette engines , never flew , possibly because at this time , blériot severed his connection with the antoinette company because the company had begun to design and construct aircraft as well as engines , presenting blériot with a conflict of interests more trials followed , the last on 19 april when , travelling at a speed of around 50 km/h ( 30 & nbsp ; mph ) , the aircraft left the ground , blériot over-responded when the nose began to rise , and the machine hit the ground nose–first , and somersaulted also wilbur had already amassed a fortune in prize money for altitude and duration flights and had secured sales contracts for the wright flyer with the french , italians , british and germans ; his tour in europe was essentially complete by the summer of 1909 the award was finally presented slightly more than three decades later by alice védères blériot , widow of louis blériot , at paris , france , 27 may 1961 , to the crew of the united states air force convair b-58a jet bomber , af serial number 59-2451 , the firefly , crewed by aircraft commander major elmer e the crowds were in for a wait : the weather was windy , and latham did not make an attempt until 19 & nbsp ; july , but from his destination his aircraft developed engine trouble and was forced to make the world 's first water landing in distress from 1913 or earlier , janes 1913 blériot 's aviation activities were handled by blériot aéronautique , based at suresnes , which continued to design and produce aircraft up to the nationalisation of most of the french aircraft industry in 1937 , when it was absorbed into sncaso the daily mail prize was first announced in october 1908 , with a prize of £500 being offered for a flight made before the end of the year blériot , who intended to fly across the channel in his type xi monoplane , had three rivals for the prize , the most serious being hubert latham , a french national of english extraction flying an antoinette iv monoplane unlike latham , blériot had not visited dover to find a suitable spot to land , and the choice had been made by fontaine , who had selected a patch of gently sloping land called northfall meadow , close to dover castle , where there was a low point in the cliffs the visibility deteriorated , and he later said , '' for more than 10 minutes i was alone , isolated , lost in the midst of the immense sea , and i did not see anything on the horizon or a single ship '' the business was successful , and soon he was supplying his lamps to both renault and panhard-levassor , two of the foremost automobile manufacturers of the day but although the aircraft flew well , after a very short time in the air , the engine began to overheat , leading blériot to get in touch with alessandro anzani , who had developed a successful motorcycle engine and had subsequently entered the aero-engine market leblanc went to bed at around midnight but was too keyed up to sleep well ; at two o'clock , he was up , and judging that the weather was ideal woke blériot who , unusually , was pessimistic and had to be persuaded to eat breakfast the daily mail correspondent , realising that blériot had landed near the castle , set off at speed in a motor car and took blériot to the harbour , where he was reunited with his wife blériot did , however , succeed in winning the prize for the fastest lap of the circuit , establishing a new world speed record for aircraft in 1930 , blériot himself instituted the blériot trophy , a one-time award which would be awarded to the first aircrew to sustain an average speed of over 2,000 kilometers per hour ( 1,242.742 miles per hour ) over one half of an hour , an extremely ambitious and prophetic target in an era when the fastest aircraft were just breaking the 200 mph mark this , the blériot vii , was a monoplane with tail surfaces arranged in what has become , apart from its use of differential elevators movement for lateral control , the modern conventional layout after modifications , it proved successful , and on 31 october 1908 he succeeded in making a cross-country flight , making a round trip from toury to arteny and back , a total distance of at the end of august , blériot was one of the flyers at the grande semaine d'aviation held at reims , where he was narrowly beaten by glenn curtiss in the first gordon bennett trophy this same crew and aircraft went on to set a number of other speed records before being lost in an accident shortly after takeoff from paris , not long after setting yet another speed record , winning the harmon trophy for a record-setting flight between new york city and paris , france ) now this investment began to pay off : orders for copies of the type xi quickly came , and by the end of the year , orders for over 100 aircraft had been received , each selling for 10,000 francs anec survived in a difficult aviation climate until late 1926 , producing blériot-whippet cars , the blériot 500cc motorcycle , motor cycle design in france , the motor cycle , 29th july 1920 , pp122-125 as well as several light aircraft active between 1905 and 1906 , the company built two unsuccessful powered aircraft , the blériot iii and the blériot iv , largely a rebuild of its predecessor in 1913 , a consortium led by blériot bought the société pour l'aviation et ses dérivés aircraft manufacturer and he became the president of the company in 1914 on 6 august he managed to reach an altitude of 12 & nbsp ; m ( 39 & nbsp ; ft ) , but one of the blades of the propeller worked loose , resulting in a heavy landing which damaged the aircraft the partnership with voisin was dissolved and blériot established his own business , recherches aéronautiques louis blériot , where he started creating his own aircraft , experimenting with various configurations sanger 2008 , pp hallion ; c.1978 by the smithsonian institution latham arrived in calais in early july , and set up his base at sangatte in the semi-derelict buildings which had been constructed for a 1881 attempt to dig a tunnel under the channel realising that a british company would have more chance to sell his models to the british government , in 1915 , he set up the blériot manufacturing aircraft company ltd tests on 17 september showed a startling improvement in performance : the aircraft quickly reached an altitude of 25 & nbsp ; m ( 82 & nbsp ; ft ) , when the engine suddenly cut out and the aircraft went into a spiralling nosedive on 25 june he made a flight lasting 15 minutes and 30 seconds , his longest to date , and the following day increased this personal record to over 36 minutes blériot then enlarged the wings slightly , and on 11 july a short successful flight of around 25–30 metres ( 84–100 & nbsp ; ft ) was made , reaching an altitude of around 2 & nbsp ; m ( 7 & nbsp ; ft ) in 1882 , aged 10 , blériot was sent as a boarder to the institut notre dame in cambrai , where he frequently won class prizes , including one for engineering drawing the couple , surrounded by a cheering crowd and photographers , were then taken to the lord warden hotel at the foot of the admiralty pier ; blériot had become a celebrity the grey line of the english coast , however , came into sight on his left ; the wind had increased , and had blown him to the east of his intended course
