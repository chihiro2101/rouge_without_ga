'' he folded it , he unfolded it , he folded it , and then he said , '' i like this ! '' but i said , '' al , it mutilates the magazine '' he takes it , runs it to bill 's office , and he was there a little while , and he comes back and he says , '' we 're going to do it ! you know what bill said ? bill said , 'so they mutilate the magazine , and then they 'll buy another one to save ! ' : four or five weeks later , al comes over to me and says , '' when are you going to do the next fold-in ? '' and i said , '' i do n't have another fold-in '' the boston phoenix the fold-in became one of mads signature features , and appeared in almost every issue of the magazine from 1964–2020 a single issue in 1977 was published without a fold-in ( though jaffee supplied the issue 's back cover ) , and a 1980 issue instead featured a unique double-visual gimmick by jaffee in which the inside back cover and the outside back cover merged to create a third image when held up to the light in a mad-like wrinkle , there are two answers to the question '' when was jaffee 's last fold-in ? '' the final one he designed appeared in the june 2019 issue instead , it ran after he officially announced his retirement at the age of 99 , as the conclusion of an '' all jaffee '' tribute issue '' in 2008 , jaffee told one newspaper , '' i never see the finished painting folded until it 's printed in the magazine '' contrasting current art techniques and jaffee 's approach , mads art director , sam viviano , said , '' i think part of the brilliance of the fold-in is lost on the younger generations who are so used to photoshop and being able to do stuff like that on a computer his last original fold-in appeared in the june 2019 issue , which was one that had originally been rejected from the june 2013 issue due to sensitivity about gun violence mads oldest regular contributor , jaffee 's work appeared in 500 of the magazine 's first 550 issues , a total unmatched by any other writer or artist he has said , '' i work for a magazine that 's essentially for young people , and to have them keep me going , i feel very lucky & nbsp ; will forbis wrote : '' this is the core of jaffee 's work : the idea that to be alive is to be constantly beleaguered by annoying idiots , poorly designed products and the unapologetic ferocity of fate '' in the book inside mad , fellow mad writer desmond devlin called jaffee '' the irreplaceable embodiment of mad magazine 's range : smart but silly , angry but understanding , sophisticated but gross , upbeat but hopeless these include his long-running '' snappy answers to stupid questions '' , which present multiple putdowns for the same unnecessary or clueless inquiry , and several articles on inventions and gadgets , which are presented in an elaborately detailed '' blueprint '' style 224–225 during the vietnam war , jaffee also created the short-lived gag cartoon hawks and doves , in which a military officer named major hawks is antagonized by private doves , an easygoing soldier who contrives to create surreptitious peace signs in various locations on a military base in a 1998 issue , all the hawks & doves strips were republished , along with an original strip in color on the back of the issue when designing his mad fold-ins , jaffee starts with the finished '' answer '' to the fold-in , and then spreads it apart and places a piece of tracing paper over it in order to fill in the center '' throw-away '' aspect of the image , which is covered up when the page is folded over , using regular pencil at this stage in 2005 , the production company motion theory created a video for recording artist beck 's song '' girl '' using jaffee 's mad fold-ins as inspiration ; jaffee 's name appears briefly in the video , on a television screen the march 13 , 2006 , episode of the colbert report aired on jaffee 's 85th birthday , and comedian stephen colbert saluted the artist with a fold-in birthday cake when i was done , i called up the producer who 'd contacted me , and i said , '' i 've finished the fold-in , where shall i send it ?
