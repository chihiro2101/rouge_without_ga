she argued that the kazon 's attempts to steal a replicator and a transporter rather than offensive weapons lessened their impact as a threatening presence , suggesting that the possibility of relations with the kazon did not '' seem much more heinous than dealing with the klingons or ferengi , who oppress women and minorities within their borders '' 205 in the first draft of the script for '' caretaker '' , piller named the alien species the '' gazon '' and wrote the following description of them : during the summer of 1994 , gazon was changed to kazon , as it was feared that the name sounded too much like gaza in the first season , the kazon were introduced as one of three new alien species that could be used as recurring antagonists ; the other two were the vidiians and the sikarians marc buxton , of den of geek ! , included the kazon on his list of the 50 best alien life forms in the star trek universe , for their '' advanced technology and a back-stabbing bloodthirst '' and success in trapping the voyager crew on a hostile planet berman , piller , and taylor reasoned that the characters would be traveling through an area of space controlled by a new alien race , serving as the show 's primary antagonists , and created the kazon to fill this role green questioned janeway 's resolve to never share voyager 's technology with the kazon , writing that the species was characterized as '' a spacefaring culture with warp drive '' so the crew would not be '' interfering with a primitive civilization '' the kazon were negatively compared to the klingons by green , who described the vidiians as a more suitable and compelling candidate to serve as the primary antagonists for the first two seasons taylor argued that the kazon limited the potential of the series , saying : '' it created the curious implication that we are standing still in space , when our franchise is that we are going at incredible speeds toward the alpha quadrant – we keep running into the same people over and over again ! it was just an oddity , and i do n't think the kazon have served us well following the end of the second season , taylor decided to remove the kazon as the series ' primary antagonists , having found the effort to develop the alien species to be unsuccessful piller said that it was suggested that the episodes could serve as an introduction to a new alien species , but he supported the possibility that they act as a farewell to the kazon storylines while acknowledging fans ' negative response to the alien species during star trek : voyager , dickens questioned if star trek : discovery would be an appropriate venue for the kazon to have a '' cameo comeback '' 190–191 taylor 's notes suggest that the show 's co-creators considered having the crips reach a truce with the main characters , which would anger another one of the gangs ( then titled the blood ) and lead to them being the primary antagonists 161 in a meeting dated august 17 , 1993 , taylor wrote a story outline for the pilot episode '' caretaker '' and established the kazon ( then identified as the crips ) as a '' gang which , in conflict with two other gangs , competes for territory in this region of space '' they determined that the kazon are characterized as primitive/inferior , savage , and criminal , and argue that the kazon 's appearance and behavior were designed to elicit a negative response from the audience prior to the announcement of a new star trek incarnation , star trek : voyager co-creators rick berman , michael piller , and jeri taylor conceived the basic concepts and characters during secret developmental meetings emphasizing the kazon 's mistreatment of the ocampa , plans to steal from voyager 's more developed technology , and inability to form lasting alliances , gonzalez describes the series as interpreting race relations in developing countries as '' inherently contentious and inevitably destabilizing '' 187 the idea for the kazon as warrior sects , as opposed to a unified race , was introduced by taylor , who drafted them as '' three gangs , with constantly shifting relationships and allegiances 127 westmore found the kazon to be the most demanding species to design for voyager first season , though , overall , he found the make-up and prosthetic work for voyager easier than that required for star trek : deep space nine he said that he wanted the casting choices to convey the alien species as '' young , angry people who never lived old enough to have the kind of experience and perspective on the world that , say , the klingons and romulans might have '' voyager 's cast members had a negative response to the continued inclusion of the kazon in the series and felt that their removal was the best course of action tim russ commented that the frequent incorporation of the species would strain the credibility of the storylines as the crew would have to eventually leave kazon-controlled space on their journey home despite the decision to eliminate the kazon from future episodes , the writing team was uncertain if the season two finale and season three premiere would focus on them 165–166 according to westmore , the prosthetic make-up for the forehead was structured in a shape reminiscent of the devil , while the ridges on the nose were inspired by a vulture 's neck piller described the season as '' a deep investigation of the kazon that will turn them , i think , into perhaps one of the top five adversarial alien races in star trek 's history '' piller believed the alien species accentuated the show 's futuristic storylines , explaining : '' there are a lot of people who do n't consider a lot of the season 's episodes to be science fiction '' in response to fans ' concerns that voyager did not incorporate as many science fiction elements as previous star trek installments , he believed that the growing focus on the kazon would serve as the solution 183 for a 2015 retrospective review of the star trek franchise , moviepilot 's david trudel wrote that he was disappointed in the breakdown of the alliance between the kazon and the trabe in the episode '' alliances '' in his 2005 book an analytical guide to television 's battlestar gallactica , literary critic john kenneth muir argued that the events of star trek : voyager lost their urgency with the basing of the second season in kazon space believing that the large amount of space under the kazon 's control was implausible , he argued that the number of times voyager encountered the alien species would make their territory bigger than the united federation of planets and the klingon empire '' when discussing his hopes for fan reaction to the second season 's emphasis on the kazon , piller said : '' i 'll be curious to know what the audience 's perception is , if our investing in the kazon this season worked in the fourth season , seven of nine ( jeri ryan ) reveals that the borg never assimilate the kazon , whom they refer to as species 329 and '' unworthy of assimilation '' due to a belief they would '' detract from perfection '' janeway stops the massacre from occurring , but relations between voyager , the kazon , and the other alien species in the delta quadrant are further strained as a result 82 prior to the premiere of star trek : discovery , donna dickens speculated that andrew lincoln 's appearance on the series could be as a character from the kazon in this episode , voyager ensign seska ( martha hackett ) is revealed to be a cardassian agent who had infiltrated chakotay 's maquis cell , subsequently objecting to the merging of crews , and janeway 's refusal to violate the prime directive the kazon takes control of the starship and maroons its crew on a seemingly desolate planet ; the doctor ( robert picardo ) and the troubled crewman lon suder ( brad dourif ) are the only two crew members left on board voyager trektoday michelle erica green provided extensive and primarily negative commentary on the kazon story arc in the first two seasons while re-watching the series the kazon also appear in novels based on the star trek franchise , including mosaic and pathways , both written by star trek : voyager co-creator jeri taylor in star trek : voyager , the kazon are known under the collective title of the kazon order , but the species are also separated into various sections in the star trek universe , prior to the arrival of voyager in the delta quadrant , hostilities between the trabe and the kazon led to the trabe keeping them subjugated even though evans described the kazon as starting from a good premise , he did not find them to live up to their label as '' the most powerful race in their area of the delta quadrant '' he negatively compared star trek : voyager to science fiction television series battlestar galactica , writing that star trek : voyager could learn from how '' the galactica must go on , ever forward , to their destination '' since a majority of the scenes involving the kazon were filmed at the el mirage lake , livingston and the filming crew were assigned to help the actors feel comfortable in the heavy make-up and prosthetics despite the high temperatures
