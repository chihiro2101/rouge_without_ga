von grumbkow had first visited tiwanaku between the end of 1876 and the beginning of 1877 , when he accompanied as a photographer the expedition of french adventurer théodore ber , financed by american businessman henry meiggs , against ber ’ s promise of donating the artifacts he will find , on behalf of meiggs , to washington 's smithsonian institution and the american museum of natural history in new york the structures that have been excavated by researchers at tiwanaku include the akapana , akapana east , and pumapunku stepped platforms , the kalasasaya , the kheri kala , and putin enclosures , and the semi-subterranean temple the proyecto arqueologico pumapunku-akapana ( pumapunku-akapana archaeological project , papa ) run by the university of pennsylvania , has been excavating in the area surrounding the pyramid for the past few years , and also conducting ground penetrating radar surveys of the area when a topographical map of the site was created in 2016 by the use of a drone , a '' set of hitherto unknown structures '' was revealed among their contributions are the rediscovery of the suka kollus , accurate dating of the civilization 's growth and influence , and evidence for a drought-based collapse of the tiwanaku civilization as the site has suffered from looting and amateur excavations since shortly after tiwanaku 's fall , archeologists must attempt to interpret it with the understanding that materials have been jumbled and destroyed as noted , the gateway of the sun , now in the kalasasaya , is believed to have been moved from its original location most recently , a statistical assessment of reliable radiocarbon dates estimates that the site was founded around ad 110 ( 50–170 , 68 % probability ) , a date supported by the lack of ceramic styles from earlier periods it is called the '' plataforma lítica '' and contains the largest stone block found in the tiwanaku site since the 1980s , researchers have recognized this date as unreliable , leading to the consensus that the site is no older than 200 or 300 bc a book containing major photographic documentation was published in 1892 by engineer georg von grumbkow , with commentary by archaeologist max uhle , this was the first in-depth scientific account of the ruins in 2013 , maritime archaeology exploring lake titicaca 's khoa reef discovered an ancient ceremonial site and lifted artifacts such as a lapis lazuli and ceramic figurines , incense burners and a ceremonial medallion from the lake floor beginning in the 1970s , carlos ponce sanginés proposed the site was first occupied around 1580 bc , the site 's oldest radiocarbon date , 1999 , interpreting the meaning of ritual spaces : the temple complex of pumapunku , tiwanaku , bolivia , doctoral dissertation , university of pennsylvania evidence of similar types of cranial vault modification in burials between the omo site and the main site of tiwanaku is also being used for this argument a prominent feature of the pumapunku is a large stone terrace ; it is 6.75 by 38.72 meters in dimension and paved with large stone blocks twenty-first-century studies have shown that it is an entirely manmade earthen mound , faced with a mixture of large and small stone blocks within many of the site 's structures are impressive gateways ; the ones of monumental scale are placed on artificial mounds , platforms , or sunken courts these structures spanned over 411 hectares , and included a stone temple and about one hundred circular or rectangular structures of vast dimensions , which were possibly domestic units . that is , the elites of the empire controlled essentially all economic output but were expected to provide each commoner with all the resources needed to perform his or her function the dirt comprising akapana appears to have been excavated from the '' moat '' that surrounds the site in the 1960s , the bolivian government initiated an effort to restore the site and reconstruct part of it it was made of a thick , prepared floor of sand and clay , which supported a group of buildings nair , 2000 , '' on reconstructing tiwanaku architecture '' : the journal of the society of architectural historians , vol near the courtyard is the semi-subterranean temple ; a square sunken courtyard that is unique for its north-south rather than east-west axis
