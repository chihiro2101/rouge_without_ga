previous attempts to answer the mind-body problem have all tried to resolve it by answering both questions : dualism says there are two substances and that mental states are characterized by their immateriality ; behaviorism claimed that there was one substance and that mental states were behavioral disposition ; physicalism asserted the existence of just one substance and characterized the mental states as physical states ( as in '' pain c-fiber firings '' ) in attempting to overcome the conceptual difficulties that arose from the idea of a nation full of chinese people wired together , each person working as a single neuron to produce in the wired-together whole the functional mental states of an individual mind , many functionalists simply bit the bullet , so to speak , and argued that such a chinese nation would indeed possess all of the qualitative and intentional properties of a mind ; i.e according to functionalism , so long as the people are performing the proper functional roles , with the proper causal relations between inputs and outputs , the system will be a real mind , with mental states , consciousness , and so on since mind-mind supervenience seemed to have become acceptable in functionalist circles , it seemed to some that the only way to resolve the puzzle was to postulate the existence of an entire hierarchical series of mind levels ( analogous to homunculi ) which became less and less sophisticated in terms of functional organization and physical composition all the way down to the level of the physico-mechanical neuron or group of neurons that is , instead of mental states receiving a purely functional explanation in terms of their relations to other mental states , like those listed above , functions are seen as playing only a part—the other part being played by structures— of the explanation of a given mental state state one , for example , is simply the state in which the machine , if it reads a b , writes a 1 and stays in that state , and in which , if it reads a 1 , it moves one square to the right and goes into a different state furthermore , constraining the mappings seems to require either consideration of the external behavior as in behaviorism , or discussion of the internal structure of the realization as in identity theory ; and though multiple realizability does not seem to be lost , the functionalist claim of the autonomy of high-level functional description becomes questionable but since these outputs are , according to functionalism , related to many ( if not all ) internal mental states , two people who experience the same pain and react with different outputs must share little ( perhaps nothing ) in common in any of their mental states the fundamental idea of psycho-functionalism is that psychology is an irreducibly complex science and that the terms that we use to describe the entities and properties of the mind in our best psychological theories can not be redefined in terms of simple behavioral dispositions , and further , that such a redefinition would not be desirable or salient were it achievable further , this basic assumption is directly antithetical to functionalism ; and , thereby , the twin earth argument does not constitute a genuine argument : as this assumption entails a flat denial of functionalism itself ( which would say that the two waters would not produce different mental states , because the functional relationships would remain unchanged ) in connection with block 's chinese nation , many functionalists responded to searle 's thought experiment by suggesting that there was a form of mental activity going on at a higher level than the man in the chinese room could comprehend ( the so-called '' system reply '' ) ; that is , the system does know chinese in the case of ordinary language terms , such as '' belief '' , '' desire '' , or '' hunger '' , the idea is that such terms get their meanings from our common-sense '' folk psychological '' theories about them , but that such conceptualizations are not sufficient to withstand the rigor imposed by materialistic theories of reality and causality but even if this succeeds in the case of pain , in the case of beliefs and meaning , it faces the difficulty of formulating a distinction between relevant and non-relevant contents ( which can be difficult to do without invoking an analytic–synthetic distinction , as many seek to avoid ) thus , unlike standard versions of functionalism ( often called functional state identity theories ) , fsts do not allow for the multiple realizability of mental states , because the fact that mental states are realized by brain states is essential this formulation , which is now called machine-state functionalism , or just machine functionalism , was inspired by the analogies which putnam and others noted between the mind and the theoretical '' machines '' or computers capable of computing any given algorithm which were developed by alan turing ( called turing machines ) thus , for example , the function or role of the heart is to pump blood , that of the kidney is to filter it and to maintain certain chemical balances and so on—this is what accounts for the purposes of scientific explanation and taxonomy , silicon-based ) but performed the same functions as human mental states ( for example , they tend to yell '' ouch ! '' when poked with sharp objects ) , we would say that their type of mental state might be similar to ours but it is the same notice , however , that crabb 's response to chalmers does not commit this fallacy : his point is the more restricted observation that even if inverted or absent qualia turn out to be nomologically impossible , and it is perfectly possible that we might subsequently discover this fact by other means , chalmers ' argument fails to demonstrate that they are impossible in the case of david lewis , there is a distinction in the concepts of '' having pain '' ( a rigid designator true of the same things in all possible worlds ) and just '' pain '' ( a non-rigid designator ) pain ) is that they are physical in nature , while functionalism says that what characterizes pain is its functional/causal role and its relationship with yelling '' ouch '' , etc the essential difference between analytic and psychofunctionalism is that the latter emphasizes the importance of laboratory observation and experimentation in the determination of which mental state terms and concepts are genuine and which functional identifications may be considered to be genuinely contingent and a posteriori identities a related critique of the inverted spectrum argument is that it assumes that mental states ( differing in their qualitative or phenomenological aspects ) can be independent of the functional relations in the brain an extremely simple example of a turing machine which writes out the sequence '111 ' after scanning three blank squares and then stops as specified by the following machine table : this table states that if the machine is in state one and scans a blank square ( b ) , it will print a 1 and remain in state one the general idea is that since it would be very unlikely for a conscious human being to experience a change in its qualia which it utterly fails to notice , mental content and functional profile appear to be inextricably bound together , at least in the human case in an analogous manner , the role of mental states , such as belief and desire , is determined by the functional or causal role that is designated for them within our best scientific psychological theory these arguments typically use the assumption that physics leads to a progression of unique states , and that functionalist realization is present whenever there is a mapping from the proposed set of mental states to physical states of the system the transducer layer is restricted to producing behavior according to a simple mapping , such as a lookup table , from inputs to actions on the system , and from the state of the system to outputs whatever the worth of this latter hypothesis , it was immediately objected that it entailed an unacceptable sort of mind-mind supervenience : the systemic mind which somehow emerged at the higher-level must necessarily supervene on the individual minds of each individual member of the chinese nation , to stick to block 's formulation arguments for his version of functionalism relied on the intuition that such alien creatures would have the same mental states as humans do , and that the multiple realizability of standard functionalism makes it a better theory of mind therefore , the argument goes , since there can be two people who are functionally identical , yet have different mental states ( differing in their qualitative or phenomenological aspects ) , functionalism is not robust enough to explain individual differences in qualia given the transitivity of supervenience , if m1 supervenes on m2 , and m2 supervenes on p ( physical base ) , then m1 and m2 both supervene on p , even though they are ( allegedly ) totally different sets of mental facts but this is counterintuitive ; it seems clear that two people share something significant in their mental states of being in pain if they both smash their finger with a hammer , whether or not they utter the same word when they cry out in pain as an example , he proposes that the economy of bolivia might be organized such that the economic states , inputs , and outputs would be isomorphic to a person under some bizarre mapping from mental to economic variables because mental states are not limited to a particular medium , they can be realized in multiple ways , including , theoretically , within non-biological systems , such as computers since no one has yet been able to formulate a clear basis or justification for the existence of such a distinction in mental contents , however , this idea has generally been abandoned in favor of externalist causal theories of mental contents ( also known as informational semantics ) similarly , functionalists argue , mental states can be explained without considering the states of the underlying physical medium ( such as the brain ) that realizes them ; one need only consider higher-level functions they are like valves ; a valve can be made of plastic or metal or other materials , as long as it performs the proper function ( controlling the flow of a liquid or gas ) that the internal structures functionalism tries to discuss turn out to be present everywhere , so that either functionalism turns out to reduce to behaviorism , or to complete triviality and therefore a form of panpsychism this account remains a sort of functionalism because functional relations are still essential to mental states , but it is mechanistic because the functional relations are always manifestations of concrete structures—albeit structures understood at a certain level of abstraction in other words , since you share the same inputs , outputs , and relations between other mental states , you are functional duplicates formulations of functionalism which stipulate absolute requirements on interaction with external objects ( external to the functional account , meaning not defined functionally ) are reduced to behaviorism instead of absolute triviality , because the input-output behavior is still required on the other hand , if it turns out that there are states which theoretical cognitive psychology posits as necessary for explanation of human behavior but which are not foreseen by ordinary folk psychological language , then these entities or states exist that is , functionalism is not so much concerned with what there is than with what it is that characterizes a certain type of mental state , e.g however , block argues , this is patently absurd , so there must be something wrong with the thesis of functionalism since it would allow this to be a legitimate description of a mind according to ned block , if functionalism is to avoid the chauvinism of type-physicalism , it becomes overly liberal in '' ascribing mental properties to things that do not in fact have them '' this , coupled with the independent assertion that a conscious being 's functional profile just could be maintained , irrespective of its experiential state , leads to the conclusion that the subject of these experiments would remain fully conscious since turing machines are not required to be physical systems , '' anything capable of going through a succession of states in time can be a turing machine '' therefore , it is not a particular physical-chemical composition responsible for the particular machine or mental state , it is the programming rules which produce the effects that are responsible thus , searle attacks the idea that thought can be equated with following a set of syntactic rules ; that is , functionalism is an insufficient theory of the mind a mechanistic explanation involves decomposing a given system , in this case a mental system , into its component physical parts , their activities or functions , and their combined organizational relations these sorts of functional definitions in terms of causal roles are claimed to be analytic and a priori truths about the submental states and the ( largely fictitious ) propositional attitudes they describe since these worlds are identical in every way except in the underlying chemical structure of water , you and your twin earth doppelgänger see exactly the same things , meet exactly the same people , have exactly the same jobs , behave exactly the same way , and so on this thought experiment attempts to show that systems which operate merely on syntactic processes ( inputs and outputs , based on algorithms ) can not realize any semantics ( meaning ) or intentionality ( aboutness )
