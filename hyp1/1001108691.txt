45 , by richard olson , publisher university of california press cicero , reacting to the chronologies of such authors as berossos ( who composed a greek-language history of babylonia , known as the babyloniaca , during the 3rd century bc ) strongly criticised the claim that the babylonians had kings going back hundreds of thousands of years : diodorus siculus also wrote something similar about how he believed the babylonians fabricated their chronology : despite these criticisms , some ancient greeks , including most notably alexander polyhistor and proclus , believed the babylonian kings were hundreds of thousands of years old , and that the babylonians dated their creation 400,000–200,000 years before their own time the turin papyrus ( in the register listing the reign of the gods ) the final two lines of the column sums up : '' venerables shemsu-hor , 13,420 years ; reigns before the shemsu-hor , 23,200 years ; total 36,620 years the mesoamerican long count calendar dates the creation of the world of human beings to 11 august 3114 bc ( in the most commonly accepted correlation ) according to the proleptic gregorian calendar , or monday , 6 september 3114 bc according to the proleptic julian calendar the bible begins with the book of genesis , in which god creates the earth , the rest of the universe , and the earth 's plants and animals , including the first humans , in six days if these events and ages are interpreted literally throughout and the genealogies are considered closed , it is possible to build up a chronology in which many of the events of the old testament are dated to an estimated number of years after creation since the biblical story lacks chronology for some periods , the duration of events has been subject to interpretation in many different ways , resulting in a variety of estimates of the date of creation the patriarchs from adam to terah , the father of abraham , were often 100 years older when they begat their named son in the septuagint than they were in the hebrew or the vulgate ( genesis 5 , 11 ) for example , the period from the creation to the flood derives from the genealogical table of the ten patriarchs listed in , and , called the generations of adam catholic encyclopedia : biblical chronology james ussher agrees with the dating until the birth of abraham , which he argues took place when terah was 130 , and not 70 as is the direct reading of , thus adding 60 years to his chronology for events postdating abraham the earliest post-exilic jewish chronicle preserved in the hebrew language , the seder olam rabbah , compiled by jose ben halafta in 160 ad , dates the creation of the world to 3761 bc while the later seder olam zutta to 4339 bc many of the earliest christians who used the septuagint version of the bible calculated creation as having occurred about 5500 bc , and christians up to the middle-ages continued to use this rough estimate : clement of alexandria ( 5592 bc ) , theophilus of antioch ( 5529 bc ) , sextus julius africanus ( 5501 bc ) , hippolytus of rome ( 5500 bc ) , gregory of tours ( 5500 bc ) , panodorus of alexandria ( 5493 bc ) , maximus the confessor ( 5493 bc ) , george syncellus ( 5492 bc ) , sulpicius severus ( 5469 bc ) and isidore of seville ( 5336 bc ) the penn commentary on piers plowman by andrew galloway page 69 in the roman martyrology , the proclamation of the birth of christ formerly used this date , as did the irish annals of the four masters from 5194 am in the annals at celt — university college cork 's corpus of electronic texts project has the full text of the annals online , both in the original irish and in o'donovan 's translation bede was one of the first to break away from the standard septuagint date for the creation and in his work de temporibus ( '' on time '' ) ( completed in 703 ad ) dated the creation to 18 march 3952 bc but was accused of heresy at the table of bishop wilfrid , because his chronology was contrary to accepted calculations of around 5500 bc among the masoretic creation estimates or calculations for the date of creation only archbishop ussher 's specific chronology dating the creation to 4004 bc became the most accepted and popular , mainly because this specific date was attached to the king james bible
