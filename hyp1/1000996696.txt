for a compact n-dimensional kähler manifold m the following conditions are equivalent to each other , but are weaker than the conditions above , though they are sometimes used as the definition of a calabi & ndash ; yau manifold : m has vanishing first real chern class enriques surfaces and hyperelliptic surfaces have first chern class that vanishes as an element of the real cohomology group , but not as an element of the integral cohomology group , so yau 's theorem about the existence of a ricci-flat metric still applies to them but they are sometimes not considered to be calabi & ndash ; yau manifolds a calabi & ndash ; yau n-fold or calabi & ndash ; yau manifold of ( complex ) dimension n is sometimes defined as a compact n-dimensional kähler manifold m satisfying one of the following equivalent conditions : the canonical bundle of m is trivial this follows from yau 's proof of the calabi conjecture , which implies that a compact kähler manifold with a vanishing first real chern class has a kähler metric in the same class with vanishing ricci curvature there are many other inequivalent definitions of calabi–yau manifolds that are sometimes used , which differ in the following ways ( among others ) : the first chern class may vanish as an integral class or as a real class one example of a three-dimensional calabi & ndash ; yau manifold is a non-singular quintic threefold in cp 4 , which is the algebraic variety consisting of all of the zeros of a homogeneous quintic polynomial in the homogeneous coordinates of the cp 4 a popular alternative known as large extra dimensions , which often occurs in braneworld models , is that the calabi & ndash ; yau is large but we are confined to a small subset on which it intersects a d-brane calabi & ndash ; yau homepage is an interactive reference which describes many examples and classes of calabi & ndash ; yau manifolds and also the physical theories in which they appear in turn , it has also been conjectured by miles reid that the number of topological types of calabi–yau 3-folds is infinite , and that they can all be transformed continuously ( through certain mild singularizations such as conifolds ) one into another & mdash ; much as riemann surfaces can for every positive integer n , the zero set , in the homogeneous coordinates of the complex projective space cp n+1 , of a non-singular homogeneous degree n & nbsp ; + & nbsp ; 2 polynomial in n & nbsp ; + & nbsp ; 2 variables is a compact calabi–yau n-fold in three complex dimensions , classification of the possible calabi & ndash ; yau manifolds is an open problem , although yau suspects that there is a finite number of families ( albeit a much bigger number than his estimate from 20 years ago ) abelian surfaces are sometimes excluded from the classification of being calabi & ndash ; yau , as their holonomy ( again the trivial group ) is a subgroup of su ( 2 ) , instead of being isomorphic to su ( 2 ) yau and nadis ( 2010 ) there are many other definitions of a calabi & ndash ; yau manifold used by different authors , some inequivalent the motivational definition given by shing-tung yau is of a compact kähler manifold with a vanishing first chern class , that is also ricci flat
