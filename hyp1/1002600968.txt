unlike adults , the maggots of hoverflies feed on a variety of foods ; some are saprotrophs , eating decaying plant or animal matter , while others are insectivores , eating aphids , thrips , and other plant-sucking insects hoverflies can , nevertheless , be distinguished in the field by anatomical features such as : the legs and mouthparts of hoverflies are usually not particularly long and thin ( some bombyliids have a long and needle-like proboscis , many have legs that are noticeably longer and thinner than in similar-sized syrphids ) their facial cuticle often has prominent bulges and/or beak- to knob-like projections ( most bee flies have an evenly curved or sloping face ) larvae of many hoverfly species prey upon pest insects , including aphids and leafhoppers , which spread some diseases such as curly top , so they are seen in biocontrol as a natural means of reducing the levels of pests syrphid flies are frequent flower visitors to a wide range of wild plants , as well as agricultural crops , and are often considered the second-most important group of pollinators after wild bees some , such as members of the genus baccha , are small , elongated , and slender , while others , such as members of criorhina , are large , hairy , and yellow and black some species are found in more unusual locations ; for example , members of the genus volucella can be found in bumblebee nests , while members of microdon are myrmecophiles , found in ant or termite nests the island is a hotspot for hoverflies and other insects ; sj√∂berg has collected 58 species of butterflies there , and ( in seven years of hunting ) 202 species of hoverflies , including 180 in his garden while some hoverfly larvae are aquatic and are often found in stagnant water , those of species that prey upon aphids and other plant parasites are usually terrestrial , residing on leaves the wings are often clear or have smooth gradients of tinting , and their veins merge posteriorly into a '' false edge '' that runs parallel to the wing 's true rear edge and extends along half or more of the wing length ( bombyliid wings lack a '' false rear edge '' and often have large dark areas with sharp boundaries , or complex patterns of spots ) certain species are more common in certain areas than others ; for example , the american hoverfly , eupeodes americanus , is common in the nearctic realm , and the common hoverfly , melangyna viridiceps , is common in the australasian realm many syrphid fly species have short , unspecialized mouth parts and tend to feed on flowers that are more open as the nectar and pollen can be easily accessed their abdomens and thoraces often have glossy cuticular body surfaces , abdominal colors are usually mainly due to cuticular pigments ( bee flies are usually very hairy , their abdominal colors are almost always due to pigmentation of hairs and not the underlying cuticle ) bees are thought to be able to carry a greater volume of pollen on their bodies , but flies may be able to compensate for this by making a greater number of flower visits native flies ( allograpta and platycheirus ) in alpine zones show preferences for flower species based on their colour in alpine zones ; syrphid flies consistently choose yellow flowers over white regardless of species predatory species are beneficial to farmers and gardeners , as aphids destroy crops , and hoverfly maggots are often used in biological control bee flies of the family bombyliidae often mimic hymenoptera and hover around flowers , as well , rendering some bombyliid species hard to tell apart from syrphidae at first glance
