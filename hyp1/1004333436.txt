of canadian composer colin mcphee , who had done extensive research in indonesian music in the 1930s and wrote a number of compositions incorporating balinese and javanese elements , harrison 's style began to change , showing the influence of gamelan music more clearly if only in timbre : '' it was the sound itself that attracted me he wrote many pieces with political texts or titles , writing , for instance , homage to pacifica for the opening of the berkeley headquarters of the pacifica radio , and accepting commissions from the portland gay men 's chorus ( 1988 and 1985 ) and by the seattle men 's chorus to arrange ( 1987 ) his strict songs , originally for eight baritones , for '' a chorus of 120 male singing enthusiasts '' in addition , harrison played and composed for the

and texts , most notably la koro sutro ( 1973 ) another component of harrison 's aesthetic is what harry partch would call corporeality , an emphasis on the physical and the sensual including live , human , performance and improvisation , timbre , rhythm , and the sense of space in his melodic lines , whether solo or in counterpoint , and most notably in his frequent dance collaborations like
