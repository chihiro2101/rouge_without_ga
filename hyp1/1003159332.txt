the tone had been improved by its conservators , who had obtained act of parliament in 1699 and 1707 , which had allowed them to straighten and dredge the river and parts of the parrett , and to build locks and half-locks to manage the water levels from 1768 there were a number of grand schemes proposed , all with the aim of linking the bristol channel to the english channel by a waterway , thereby avoiding the need to navigate by sea around cornwall and devon james brindley was the first to survey a route , which would have run from the bristol channel to exeter , following the course of the river tone for part of its route jessop 's assistant , josiah easton , suggested a route from uphill ( on the bristol channel ) to seaton , again in 1794 , and the previous two schemes sought parliamentary approval as the grand western canal and the bristol and western canal , respectively john rennie surveyed the line for a ship canal from the mouth of the river parrett to seaton in 1810 , which was designed for ships of , but it was felt that the economic situation would not support the projected expenditure of over £1 & nbsp ; million finally , a barge canal between bridgwater and beer , costing £600,000 , was proposed in 1828 , but enthusiasm for large canal schemes was waning , and the advent of iron-hulled steamships meant that the risks of navigation around the south-west peninsula were reduced the canal was an obvious competitor to the river tone navigation , which was managed by the conservators of the river tone , a legal body created for that purpose by act of parliament in 1699 they also had powers to construct a lock and a short length of canal at french weir , to connect with the grand western canal , while the conservators were allowed to conduct an annual inspection of the canal , and to resume their ownership of the river if the canal was not maintained in good order subsequently the canal company , in order to protect their trade , sought their own act to construct a floating harbour to the west of bridgwater , and to extend the canal to join it there it entered bridgwater docks , which consisted of : inner basin that covered outer basin covering the two basins were connected by a lock , whilst towards the river a ship lock consisting of a single gate , and a barge lock , consisting of a pair of gates despite commercial success , the interest payments on the mortgage were crippling , and in 1846 the company obtained an act to convert the canal into a railway , although its powers were never used the main attraction was the dock , with its large volume of coal traffic , but they purchased both the canal and the dock for £64,000 , under the terms of an act of parliament obtained that year , which included a requirement that there should always be '' a good and sufficient water communication between the towns of taunton and bridgwater '' unlike many such acquisitions , the canal was seen as a useful adjunct to the railway network , and was maintained in good order for several years , with the conservators of the river tone continuing their annual inspections , and reporting any defects to the railway company large volumes of water were discharged from the canal every fortnight , when the bridgwater dock was scoured , in order to free it from silt , while the railway company was extracting water to supply the station and steam locomotive sheds at taunton the new owners were remote , and were more interested in the water supply for taunton station and for the bridgwater dock , than running the canal as a going concern , with the result that the canal deteriorated further the remaining traffic moved to the railway , the last commercial boats used the canal , from bridgwater dock to a wharf in north town , taunton , in 1907 , and the canal was effectively closed image : pillbox and engine house.jpg thumb left a pillbox which formed part of the taunton stop line , with creech engine house , charlton , in the background after the world war i the canal remained in a state of limbo – with minimal maintenance by the railway company – and was the haunt of fishermen and walkers during the world war ii the route of the canal was employed as part of the taunton stop line , a defensive line which followed the course of canals and railway embankments from the mouth of the parrett to seaton on the south coast the maintenance of the channel enabled the canal to become one of the first to be used for the water transportation , which was pumped from the canal to durleigh reservoir from 1962 onwards bridgwater docks , which had been used by a small amount of coastal shipping , were finally closed in 1971 : the connection at the docks was stopped up , and the british waterways board were granted permission to cease maintaining the canal for navigation the inland waterways association produced a report , entitled the bridgwater and taunton canal - waterway with a future , suggesting that the canal had the potential for development as a linear country park , and the county planning officer for somerset county council produced a second report , suggesting that funds should be made available for maintenance and restoration , which the county council duly adopted the countryside act 1968 provided a framework for such action , and a visit in 1971 to see the work being done on the monmouthshire and brecon canal as part of the creation of the brecon beacons national park convinced the council of the wisdom of such a course of action work on the deep cutting between west street and albert street started in september 1978 , jointly funded by the county council and sedgemoor district council , using direct labour , while a manpower services commission scheme to dredge the canal from the dock to the cutting and to widen the towpath was funded by the district council in 1981 not only is there a risk of silt entering the canal , but the salt water can not be allowed to contaminate the fresh , as the canal is still used for the transport of drinking water for the population of bridgwater the canal forms part of the local flood relief system , in winter taking water from the river tone at taunton and discharging it into the parrett at a sluice in the western fringe of bridgwater , near the bridgwater canalside centre
