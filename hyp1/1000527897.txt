list 's views on free trade were in explicit contradiction to those of adam smith , who , in the wealth of nations , said that '' the most advantageous method in which a landed nation can raise up artificers , manufacturers , and merchants of its own is to grant the most perfect freedom of trade to the artificers , manufacturers , and merchants of all other nations more recently , the rapid growth of east asian economies , or the newly industrialized countries ( nics ) , has also been associated with active industrial policies that selectively promoted manufacturing and facilitated technology transfer and industrial upgrading precisely speaking , south korea 's development can be explained by the fact that it followed the similar industrial policies that uk , us and germany implemented , and south korea adopted export-oriented industrialization ( eoi ) policy from 1964 based on its own decision contrary to the import substitution industrialization ( isi ) policy touted by international aid organizations and experts at that time many of these domestic policy choices , however , are now seen as detrimental to free trade and are hence limited by various international agreements such as wto trims or trips however contemporary industry policy generally accepts globalization as a given , and focuses less on the decline of older industries , and more on the growth of emergent industries in order to catch-up and even overtake industrialized countries technologically , china 's '' state activities even extend to efforts to prevent the dominance of foreign investors and technologies in areas considered to be of key significance such as the strategic industries and the new technologies '' including robotics and new energy vehicles industrial policy is seen as harmful as governments lack the required information , capabilities and incentives to successfully determine whether the benefits of promoting certain sectors above others exceeds the costs and in turn implement the policies 163â€“84 while the east asian tigers provided successful examples of heterodox interventions and protectionist industrial policies , industrial policies such as import-substitution-industrialization ( isi ) have failed in many other regions such as latin america and sub-saharan africa of particular relevance for developing countries are the conditions under which industrial policies may also contribute to poverty reduction , such as a focus on specific industries or the promotion of linkages between larger companies and smaller local enterprises .
