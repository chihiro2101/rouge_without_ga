in languages written with alphabetic or syllabary scripts , one might expect that there would be a close match of the script or spelling with the phonetics however , even if they match at one time and place for some speakers , over time they often do not match well for the majority : one sound may be represented by various combinations of letters and one letter or group of letters pronounced differently spelling is easier in languages with more or less consistent spelling systems such as finnish , serbian , italian and spanish , owing to the fact that , either , pronunciation in these languages has changed relatively little since the establishment of their spelling-systems , or else that non-phonemic etymological spellings have been replaced with phonemic unetymological spellings as pronunciation changes spelling reforms have been proposed for various languages over the years ; these have ranged from modest attempts to eliminate particular irregularities ( such as sr1 or initial teaching alphabet ) through more far-reaching reforms ( such as cut spelling ) to attempts to introduce a full phonemic orthography , like the shavian alphabet or its revised version , quikscript , the latest devagreek alphabet , extended english alphabet with devanagari orthography the turkish alphabet or hangul in korea it is also argued that when people read , they do not try to work out the series of sounds composing each word , but instead they recognize words either as a whole or as a short series of meaningful units ( for example morphology might be read as morph+ology , rather than as a longer series of phonemes ) the need for everyone to learn the new spellings the need to reprint books and other publications in the new spellings the continued need also to learn the old spellings , as older books will exist for some time the need to decide between alternative proposals : it will not be possible to satisfy everyone if spellings are changed to more closely match pronunciation , then their etymology will be more opaque , and they will diverge from spellings of similar words in other languages , and also from the pronunciation of other dialects , making the text more opaque for speakers of those languages and dialects english has generally preserved the original spelling when borrowing words ; and even more importantly , english began to be widely written and printed during the middle english period : the later development of modern english included a great vowel shift and many other changes in phonology , yet the older spellings , which are no longer phonetic , have been kept for example , for '' debt '' early middle english wrote det/dette , with the b being standardized in spelling in the 16th century , after its latin etymon debitum ; similarly for quer/quere , which was respelled as choir in the 17th century , modelled on greek χορός chorus ; in both cases , the pronunciation was not changed therefore , most spelling reform proposals include multi-letter graphemes , as does current english spelling ( for example the first two phonemes of '' sheep '' are represented by the digraphs , , and , , respectively in the 1950s , the language reform committee of the people 's republic of china devised the pinyin orthography and promulgated it as the official romanization system of mainland china in 1990 , a substantial reform ordered by the french prime minister changed the spelling of about 2000 words as well as some grammar rules there are 6000 words , including words which were not part of the 1990 reform , for example , charrette or charette , based on chariot even though german spelling was already more consistent than english or french spelling , the german language countries signed an agreement on spelling reforms in 1996 ; these were planned to be gradually introduced beginning in 1998 and fully in force by 2005 in summer 2004 , various newspapers and magazines returned to the old spelling , and in march 2006 , the most controversial changes of rechtschreibreform were reverted after independence , there were spelling reforms in 1907 , 1917 , 1938 , 1941 , 1981 and 2005 , reflecting the tug-of-war between the spelling preferred by traditionalists and reformers , depending on social class , urbanization , ideology , education and dialect later reforms ( brazil , 1943 and 1971 ; portugal , 1945 and 1973 ) have aimed mainly at three goals : to eliminate the few remnants of redundant etymological spelling , to reduce the number of words marked with diacritics and hyphens , and to bring the brazilian spelling standard and the portuguese spelling standard ( used in all the portuguese speaking countries , except brazil ) closer to each other the agreement is used by the government and the teaching realms , as well as many of the press and publishing houses of both countries , and by state-related institutions during the transition period , four spellings will coexist : the official portuguese spelling before the reform ( used in all portuguese speaking countries in africa , asia and oceania , as used in portugal by the people ) , the official brazilian spelling before the reform ( used in brazil only ) , the portuguese spelling after the reform ( used by the government and its institutions , some media and publishers in translated books ) , and the brazilian spelling after the reform ( used by the government , media and publishers in translated books ) the russian orthography was simplified by eliminating four obsolete letters , and and the archaic usage of the letter ( called , or hard sign ) at the ends of words , which had originally represented a vowel with a sound similar to schwa , but had become silent by the middle ages the alphabet of marin drinov was used until the orthographic reform of 1945 , when the letters yat ( uppercase ѣ , lowercase ѣ ) and yus ( uppercase ѫ , lowercase ѫ ) were removed from the alphabet , reducing the number of letters to 30 a series of reforms have been undertaken to set the standards , in order to bring the writing system to parity with spoken language there have been initiatives since then to further reform the spelling of spanish : andrés bello succeeded in making his proposal official in several south american countries , but they later returned to the standard of the spanish royal academy in a 1948 reform , the danish language abandoned the capitalization of common nouns ( originally a german-inspired rule ) to align with the other scandinavian languages some people had called for an even more radical reform that would also homogenise the spellings of the , and sounds , which to this day remain highly diverse in swedish venetian : the venetian language has never had an official orthography , because it was considered a dialect until recent times , and also now many do n't consider it as a '' distinct '' language anyway , there are some attempts to establish a standard orthography for venetian , like the grafia veneta unitaria ( '' shared venetian spelling '' ) , a spelling created by a committee convened by the region veneto in 1995
