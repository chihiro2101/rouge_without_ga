the characteristics of naïve art are an awkward relationship to the formal qualities of painting , especially not respecting the three rules of the perspective ( such as defined by the progressive painters of the renaissance ) : decrease of the size of objects proportionally with distance , muting of colors with distance , decrease of the precision of details with distance , the results are : effects of perspective geometrically erroneous ( awkward aspect of the works , children 's drawings look , or medieval painting look , but the comparison stops there ) strong use of pattern , unrefined color on all the plans of the composition , without enfeeblement in the background , an equal accuracy brought to details , including those of the background which should be shaded off whereas naïve art ideally describes the work of an artist who did not receive formal education in an art school or academy , for example henri rousseau or alfred wallis , 'pseudo naïve ' or 'faux naïve ' art describes the work of an artist working in a more imitative or self-conscious mode and whose work can be seen as more imitative than original '' primitive art '' is another term often applied to art by those without formal training , but is historically more often applied to work from certain cultures that have been judged socially or technologically '' primitive '' by western academia , such as native american , subsaharan african or pacific island art ( see tribal art ) however , most experts agree that the year that naive art was '' discovered '' was 1885 , when the painter paul signac became aware of the talents of henri rousseau and set about organizing exhibitions of his work in a number of prestigious galleries at this time , according to the world encyclopedia of naive art ( 1984 ) , the village amounted to little more than ' a few muddy winding streets and one-storey houses ' , but it produced such a remarkable crop of artists that it became virtually synonymous with yugoslav naive painting there also exist the terms '' naïvism '' and '' primitivism '' which are usually applied to professional painters working in the style of naïve art ( like paul gauguin , mikhail larionov , paul klee ) this was instigated by leading intellectuals of the time such as the poet antun gustav matoš and the biggest name in croatian literature , miroslav krleža , who called for an individual national artistic style that would be independent from western influences , the bard brothers – painting america under steam and sail , abrams , new york 1997 ilija bašičević ( 1895–1972 ) andré bauchant ( 1873–1958 ) camille bombois ( 1883–1970 ) sam byrne ( 1883–1978 ) charles callins ( 1887–1982 ) ferdinand cheval , known as 'le facteur cheval ' ( 1836–1924 ) denys corbet ( 1826–1910 ) henry darger ( 1892–1973 ) theora hamblett ( 1895–1977 ) mary jewels ( 1886–1977 ) john kane ( 1860–1934 ) alena kish ( 1889 or 1896–1949 ) belarus arnold kramer ( 1882–1976 ) olof krans ( 1838–1916 ) antonio ligabue ( 1899–1965 ) cándido lópez ( 1840–1902 ) séraphine louis , known as 'séraphine de senlis ' ( 1864–1942 ) l at all events , naive art can be regarded as having occupied an '' official '' position in the annals of twentieth-century art since – at the very latest – the publication of the der blaue reiter , an almanac in 1912 nobody knows exactly when the first naive artists appeared on the scene , as from the very first manifestations of art right up to the days of the '' modern classic '' , naive artists quite unconsciously bequeathed us unmistakable signs of their creative activity wassily kandinsky and franz marc , who brought out the almanac , presented 6 reproductions of paintings by le douanier ' rousseau ( henri rousseau ) , comparing them with other pictorial examples hlebine is a small picturesque municipality in the north of croatia that in 1920s became a setting against which a group of self-taught peasants began to develop a unique and somewhat revolutionary style of painting parkstone international is often seen as outsider art that is by someone without formal ( or little ) training or degree the group was marxist in orientation and was partly modelled on '' neue sachlichkeit '' , leading to more stylized forms , and the emergence of naive painting ivan generalić was the first master of the hlebine school , and the first to develop a distinctive personal style , achieving a high standard in his art
