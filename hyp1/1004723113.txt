in the theory of general relativity , the concept of causality is generalized in the most straightforward way : the effect must belong to the future light cone of its cause , even if the spacetime is curved indeed , it is possible to consider the newtonian equations of motion of the gravitational interaction of two bodies , : m_1 \frac_2 ( t ) of the two bodies , without interpreting the right hand sides of these equations as forces ; the equations just describe a process of interaction , without any necessity to interpret one body as the cause of the motion of the other , and allow one to predict the states of the system at later ( as well as earlier ) times in both einstein 's theory of special and general relativity , causality means that an effect can not occur from a cause that is not in the back ( past ) light cone of that event this requirement has been very influential in the past , in the first place as a result of direct observation of causal processes ( like pushing a cart ) , in the second place as a problematic aspect of newton 's theory of gravitation ( attraction of the earth by the sun by means of action at a distance ) replacing mechanistic proposals like descartes ' vortex theory ; in the third place as an incentive to develop dynamic field theories ( e.g '' the transactional interpretation of quantum mechanics '' 3.10 the arrow of time in the transactional interpretation – the formalism of quantum mechanics , at least in its relativistically invariant formulation , is completely even handed in dealing with the '' arrow '' of time , the distinction between future and past time directions confusion between causality and determinism is particularly acute in quantum mechanics , this theory being acausal in the sense that it is unable in many cases to identify the causes of actually observed effects or to predict the effects of identical causes , but arguably deterministic in some interpretations ( e.g thus , in classical physics , it was assumed that all events are caused by earlier ones according to the known laws of nature , culminating in pierre-simon laplace 's claim that if the current state of the world were known with precision , it could be computed for any time in the future or the past ( see laplace 's demon ) the possibility of such a time-independent view is at the basis of the deductive-nomological ( d-n ) view of scientific explanation , considering an event to be explained if it can be subsumed under a scientific law a related way to interpret the butterfly effect is to see it as highlighting the difference between the application of the notion of causality in physics and a causality as represented by inus similarly , a cause can not have an effect outside its front ( future ) light cone this is equivalent to the statement that the cause and its effect are separated by a timelike interval , and the effect belongs to the future of its cause it would be difficult and pointless , however , to explain the motions of binary stars with respect to each other in that way which , indeed , are time-reversible and agnostic to the arrow of time , but with such a direction of time established , the entire evolution system could then be completely determined for instance , when a massive sphere is caused to roll down a slope starting from a point of unstable equilibrium , then its velocity is assumed to be caused by the force of gravity accelerating it ; the small push that was needed to set it into motion is not explicitly dealt with as a cause for example , the notion that events can be ordered into causes and effects is necessary to prevent ( or at least outline ) causality paradoxes such as the grandfather paradox , which asks what happens if a time-traveler kills his own grandfather before he ever meets the time-traveler 's grandmother the ordinary situations in which humans singled out some factors in a physical interaction as being prior and therefore supplying the '' because '' of the interaction were often ones in which humans decided to bring about some state of affairs and directed their energies to producing that state of affairs—a process that took time to establish and left a new state of affairs that persisted beyond the time of activity of the actor by the same token the butterfly can be seen as triggering a tornado , its cause being assumed to be seated in the atmospherical energies already present beforehand , rather than in the movements of a butterfly
