as a child , giles dreamed of being either '' a fighter pilot or possibly a grocer '' , but he soon learned that being a watcher is a calling , much as being a slayer is , and rupert 's father explained his destiny to him when he was ten years old ( revealed in '' never kill a boy on the first date '' ) although the scooby gang later joked that he wore tweed diapers as a child , giles was in fact a rebellious youth , rejecting his responsibility as a watcher and dropping out of oxford university , where he was studying history , when he was twenty-one during this time , giles claimed to be a founding member of pink floyd in order to impress girls ( although since pink floyd was founded in 1965 , when giles would have been around ten years old , it was not a particularly credible claim ) , and may have delved into criminal activity ( he remarks that hot-wiring a car is '' like riding a bloody bicycle '' , and band candy giles has no qualms about breaking into a clothing store and attacking a police officer ) before becoming a fully-fledged watcher , he also worked as '' the curator of a british museum , maybe the british museum '' as willow says ( '' welcome to the hellmouth '' ) , although , given the context , she may well have been repeating a rumor that was going around the school as buffy 's cruciamentum approaches ( a brutal tradition of the watchers ' council in which a depowered slayer is forced to battle a particularly dangerous vampire using only her wits ) , giles struggles to cope with the guilt of betraying buffy 's trust when ethan rayne casts a spell on giles which turns him into a fyarl demon ( '' a new man '' ) , he must enlist spike 's help to escape the initiative and buffy , which believes him to be a demon who murdered giles buffy stands up to the council , pointing out that without her there 's no need for a council , and tells them to give her all information concerning glory and to reinstate giles as her official watcher willow , still recovering from an addiction to magic , suffers a relapse , kills warren and attempts to kill his former partners in crime , before resolving to end humanity 's pain ( and her own ) by destroying the world as dark willow boasts of her indestructibility , giles knocks her to the floor with a blast of magic energy , saying '' i 'd like to test that theory '' ( '' two to go '' ) after being filled in on everything that has happened to the scoobies in his absence , giles apologizes to buffy , insisting that he never should have left them , but buffy assures him that he did the right thing originally , giles was to appear in '' a hole in the world '' as the one whom angel and spike approached in an attempt to save fred , because whedon needed a character who would be instantly believed ( by the characters and by the audience ) when he said there was no way to save fred as a main character from the beginning of the series , giles has appeared in most of the spin-off books published based on the series he plays a particularly key role in the lost slayer series , where a chain of events lead to buffy ( from a point early in the fourth season ) being projected into the body of her twenty-four-year-old self in a timeline where giles was turned into a vampire by the followers of an aztec bat god , forcing buffy to face a foe who knows her every technique before she manages to find a way to return to the past and prevent giles being captured and turned in the canonical comic book continuation of the series , buffy the vampire slayer season eight , the scooby gang has expanded into a global organization , training approximately five hundred slayers spread over ten squads giles is head of the slayer operations in england , parallel with andrew 's operations in italy and buffy and xander 's in scotland , and he keeps in close contact with xander and andrew , discussing issues after they are both forced to make the difficult decisions to kill the rogue slayer gigi and her mentor roden , they decide to work together in the future as equal partners , keeping slayers from turning down the dark path that both faith and gigi walked giles goes to warn faith as duncan states this is the fate that slayers deserve for rejecting the watchers council , especially buffy , reminding giles that buffy 's relationship with angel resulted in jenny calendar 's death in the penultimate issue of season eight , angel is possessed by a powerful mystical entity known as twilight , and while under its influence , murders giles , after giles deliberately put himself in harm 's way to provoke buffy to action afterwards , it is revealed that giles has left to faith his entire estate in his will ( with the exception of the 'vampyr ' book from the first episode of the series , which he leaves to buffy ) , and faith assures buffy this does n't mean giles cared about her less but rather felt faith needed it more in a 2011 interview , whedon stated that his decision to kill off giles could not be discussed in detail '' because ripples from that event '' will also be a large part of both buffy season nine and angel and faith however , he was able to explain other motivations ; he felt that from a writing perspective , giles did not work in the comic book medium where he had flourished on the television show over the course of several arcs giles ' life before sunnydale is shown in flashbacks as angel and faith gather pieces of giles ' soul from demons or magical objects that were significant in giles ' life because giles had sold his soul to eyghon in his youth , he did not move on even though he died a natural death , and the core of his soul went to eyghon , while smaller parts broke off and attached themselves to the things angel & faith had found the presence of three beings inside angel 's body ( himself , angelus and giles ) prevent eyghon from controlling angel , and giles speaks through him as angel kills eyghon and therefore has all of giles ' soul using a mystical item to restore giles ' corpse to full health and coames ' collection of artifacts to provide magic for a resurrection spell , angel , faith , coames and the fairweathers try to bring him back to life the group is shocked when giles comes back to life with all his memories intact , but in the body of a 12-year-old boy due to his aunts thinking of him as a child during the ritual giles is grateful to be free of eyghon but furious at the age of his body and they have been trying to bring him back and not stopping a plot by villains whistler ( buffyverse ) , pearl and nash to mutate humans into a magical species at the cost of a few billion lives while resenting the challenges of his youthful body compared to his adult mind , giles adapts to his new situation , particularly with the discovery that his command of magic is more potent in his youthful body ; his aunts speculate that he is tapping into the full potential that he repressed to focus on his studies as a watcher giles has extensive knowledge of demonology and slayer combat ( including at least a theoretical knowledge of jujutsu and aikido , but excelling at the art of fencing ) , mainly due to his training as a watcher his youthful interest in witchcraft and sorcery has endured into his adult life ; though his natural aptitude for it is only moderate ( much less than that of willow ) , he does have a high amount of magical knowledge giles is proficient in several languages , including latin , ancient greek , sumerian ( '' primeval '' ) , japanese ( '' checkpoint '' ) , and possibly gaelic ( '' fear , itself '' ) , but weak in german ( '' gingerbread '' ) , mandarin and cantonese ( '' first date '' ) while his demeanor is typically mild and polite , giles is not above using raw violence to solve a problem , such as physically threatening principal snyder into readmitting buffy to school after her expulsion ( '' dead man 's party '' ) , pummeling angelus senseless with a flaming baseball bat and arson his hideout upon discovering that he had killed jenny calendar ( '' passion '' ) , manhandling spike while ordering him to get over his feelings for buffy ( '' i was made to love you '' ) , forcing glory 's minion slook to talk by inflicting a painful-sounding injury offscreen ( '' tough love '' ) , severely beating up ethan rayne for information ( '' halloween '' ) , and suffocating a critically injured ben with his bare hands to keep glory from awakening in his body sophronia and lavinia theorised that if giles had been tutored in magic by them rather than being trained as a watcher at the wishes of his father and grandmother , he would have become an extremely powerful magician , and could achieve this potential in his new life however , being a librarian , his occupation requires the use of up-to-date technology and skills to further a library service 's goals to serve its patrons efficiently , and in one episode ( '' gingerbread '' ) , shows that giles is proficient with computers at least on a basic level
