focused on removing potential competitors , intel spent many years in legal battles with cyrix , consuming cyrix financial resources , claiming that the cyrix 486 violated intel 's patents , when in reality the design was proven independent cyrix , whose processors had been considered a performance product in 1996 , had fallen to the mid-range , then to the entry level , and then to the fringe of the entry level , and was in danger of completely losing its market in august 1997 , while the litigation was still in progress , cyrix merged with national semiconductor ( who also already held an intel cross-license ) in 1995 , with its pentium clone not yet ready to ship , cyrix repeated its own history and released the cyrix cx5x86 ( m1sc ) , which plugged into a 3.3v 486 socket , ran at 80 , 100 , 120 , or 133 & nbsp ; mhz , and yielded performance comparable to that of a pentium running at 75 & nbsp ; mhz while some in the industry speculated this would lead to ibm using 6x86 cpus extensively in its product line and improve cyrix 's reputation , ibm continued to mostly use intel cpus , and to a lesser extent , amd cpus , in the majority of its products and only used the cyrix designs in a few budget models , mostly sold outside of the united states via did , however , continue producing late-generation cyrix chips for a while , such as the via cyrix iii ( also known as cyrix 3 or via c3 ) , a 600 & nbsp ; mhz cpu with a 100 & nbsp ; mhz bus eventually , cyrix was able to release the cyrix cx486s and later cyrix cx486dx that was pin-compatible with its intel 486 counterparts in 1994 , following a series of disagreements with ti , and production difficulties at sgs thomson , cyrix turned to ibm microelectronics , whose production technology rivaled that of intel intel feared having to face the antitrust claims made by cyrix , so intel paid cyrix 12 million to settle the antitrust claims right before a federal jury in sherman , texas , was to hear and rule on the antitrust claims by the time national semiconductor sold cyrix to via technologies , the design team was no more and the market for the mii had disappeared the follow-on 1997 cyrix–intel litigation was the reverse : instead of intel claiming that cyrix 486 chips violated their patents , now cyrix claimed that intel 's pentium pro and pentium ii violated cyrix patents – in particular , the power-management and register-renaming techniques cyrix developed the cayenne core as an evolution of the 6x86mx/mii processor , with dual issue fpu , support for 3dnow instructions and a 256 & nbsp ; kb , 8-way associative , on-die l2 cache this would not have been a big problem for the 6x86 if , by that time , quake had a fallback to do perspective correction without the fpu as in , for example , the game descent cyrix 's failure is described by glenn henry , ceo of centaur technology , thus : '' cyrix had a good product , but they got bought by a 'big smokestack ' company and they got bloated although the company was short-lived and the brand name is no longer actively used by its current owner , cyrix 's competition with intel created the market for budget cpus , which cut the average selling price of pcs and ultimately forced intel to release its celeron line of budget processors and cut the prices of its faster processors more quickly in order to compete in 1996 , cyrix released the mediagx cpu , which integrated all of the major discrete components of a pc , including sound and video , onto one chip initially , cyrix tried to charge a premium for the cyrix-claimed extra performance , but the 6x86 's math coprocessor was not as fast as that in the intel pentium the chips were widely criticized in product reviews for not offering the performance suggested by their names , and for the confusion caused by their naming similarity with intel 's sl line and ibm 's slc line of cpus , neither of which was related to cyrix 's slc the cyrix chips did gain some following with upgraders , as their 50- , 66- , and 80 & nbsp ; mhz 486 cpus ran at 5 & nbsp ; v , rather than the 3.3 & nbsp ; v used by amd , making the cyrix chips usable as upgrades in early 486 motherboards cyrix was free to have their products manufactured by any manufacturer that had a cross-license with intel , which included sgs thomson , ibm , and others its early cpu products included the 486slc and 486dlc , released in 1992 , which , despite their names , were pin-compatible with the 386sx and dx , respectively as a part of the settlement of the antitrust claims against intel , cyrix also received a license to some of the patents that intel had asserted that cyrix infringed national semiconductor distanced itself from the cpu market , and without direction , the cyrix engineers left one by one this core was intended to be used in multiple products , including a successor to the mediagx chip , a product codenamed jedi which was to be a socket & nbsp ; 7 compatible processor which was later cancelled in favor of a socket & nbsp ; 370 compatible processor codenamed gobi it is unclear how advanced development on this core was when cyrix was acquired from national semiconductor by via technologies and the project discontinued because the 6x86 was more efficient on an instructions per cycle basis than intel 's pentium , and because cyrix sometimes used a faster bus speed than either intel or amd , cyrix and competitor amd co-developed the controversial performance rating ( pr ) system in an effort to compare their products more favorably with intel 's
