the fokker scourge is usually considered by the british to have begun on 1august , when b.e.2cs of 2 squadron royal flying corps ( rfc ) bombed the base of ffa62 at waking the german pilots , including boelcke ( most likely , still with e 3/15 ) and immelmann ( flying e 13/15 ) , who were quickly into the air after the raiders parschau had received the new e.1/15 ( fokker factory serial 191 ) , the initial example of the five fokker m.5k/mg service test examples for the line of aircraft , when the a.16/15 ( green machine ) , he had flown since the beginning of the war , was returned to the fokker flugzeugbau factory in schwerin–gorries for development grey , founder of the aeroplane , one of the first aviation magazines and noel pemberton billing , a royal naval air service ( rnas ) pilot , notably unsuccessful aircraft designer and manufacturer and a member of parliament from march 1916 by late october , towards the end of the battle of loos , more fokkers ( including the similar pfalz e-type fighters , which were also called fokkers by allied airmen ) were encountered by rfc pilots and by december , forty fokkers were in service the device was fitted to the most suitable fokker type , the fokker m.5k ( military type name '' fokker a.iii '' ) , of which a.16/15 , assigned to otto parschau , became the prototype of the fokker eindecker series of fighter designs pemberton billing also blamed the initially poor performance of british aircraft manufacturers on what he saw as the favouritism shown by the rfc , an arm of the british army , towards the royal aircraft factory , which , while nominally civilian , was also part of the army the war in the air - fighters : the fokker scourge the fokker scourge caricature satirising exaggerated view of fokker scourge the aeroplane , volume 10 , january–march 1916 an aviator 's field book , being the field reports of oswald bölcke , from 1 august 1914 – 28 october 1916 rfc losses were exacerbated by the increase in the number of aircraft at the front , from 85 to 161 between march and september , the hard winter of 1915–1916 and some aggressive flying by the new german '' c '' type two-seaters the new '' c '' class , armed two-seaters and twin-engined '' k '' ( later '' g '' ) class aircraft such as the aeg g.i were attached in ones and twos to ( ffa ) artillery-observation and reconnaissance detachments for '' fighter '' sorties , mostly the escort of unarmed aircraft 29 before the unsuitability of the b.e.2c for aerial combat was exposed by the first fokker aces , criticism was not primarily aimed at the technical quality of royal aircraft factory aircraft but because a government body was competing with private industry allied casualties had been light by later standards but the loss of air superiority to the germans , flying a new and supposedly invincible aircraft , caused dismay among the allied commanders and lowered the morale of allied airmen immelmann was soon allocated a very early production fokker e.i , e.13/15 , one of the first armed with the lmg 08 ( a lightened version of the mg08 spandau ) machine-gun , using the more reliable production version of the fokker gear the new aircraft created another fokker scourge in the summer of 1918 and as a condition of the armistice , germany was required to surrender all of its fokker d.viis to the allies none of the german pilots attacked and all the british aircraft returned , only to meet two german aircraft coming back from a bombing raid , which opened fire and mortally wounded the pilot of one the escorts 52 the first british aircraft with a synchronisation gear was a bristol scout , which arrived on 25 march 1916 and on 24 may the first sopwith 1½ strutter aircraft were flown to france by a flight of 70 squadron 158 british and french reconnaissance flights to get aerial photography for intelligence and ranging data for their artillery had become riskier , in spite of german fighters being forbidden to fly over allied lines ( to keep the synchronisation gear secret ) the period of allied air superiority that followed the fokker scourge was brief ; by mid-september 1916 , the first twin-spandau armed albatros d.i fighters were coming into service this policy , for various reasons , prevailed for most of the war ; the rarity of german fighters appearing behind the allied lines limited the degree of air superiority they were able to attain grey had orchestrated a campaign against the royal aircraft factory in the pages of the aeroplane , going back to its period as the balloon factory , well before it had produced any heavier-than-air aircraft new d type single-seat , biplane fighters , particularly the fokker d.ii and halberstadt d.ii , had been under test since late 1915 and the replacement of the monoplanes with these types began by mid-1916 by july 1916 , kek had been formed at vaux , avillers , jametz and cunel near verdun as well as other places on the western front , as ( aerial guard service ) units , consisting only of fighters the war in the air , being the story of the part played in the great war by the royal air force , ( volume ii ) m.5k/mg prototype airframe e.3/15 , the first delivered to ffa62 , was armed with a parabellum mg14 gun , synchronised by the unreliable first version of the fokker gear impulses from a cam driven by the engine controlled the timing of the machine-gun for its fire to be limited to the intervals between the propeller blades 's travel past the barrel when the news of the fokker monoplane fighters reached him in late 1915 , grey was quick to blame the problem on orders for equipment that the latest developments had rendered obsolete pemberton billing claimed that , even among writers who recognised the hysteria of this version of events , this picture of the fokker scourge gained considerable currency during the war and afterwards 9 in late may , german air activity on the british front decreased markedly , while the commander of the new , ( colonel ) hermann von der lieth-thomsen , reorganised the german air service the fokker , with its typical controls , an over-sensitive balanced elevator and dubious lateral control , was difficult to fly ; parschau , who was experienced on fokkera types , converted pilots to the new fighter the kek were units mostly of two to four fighters , equipped with and other types which had served with ffa units during the winter of 1915–1916 the effect of the new allied types , especially the nieuport , was of considerable concern to the fokker pilots ; some even took to flying captured examples saulnier had failed to develop a synchroniser and with garros , as an interim solution , fitted metal wedges to the propeller ; bullets that hit the blades were deflected by them in the next two years , the allied air forces gradually overwhelmed the in quality and quantity , until the germans were only able to gain temporary control over small areas of the western front by early 1915 , the german ( ohl , supreme army command ) had ordered the development of machine-gun-armed aircraft to counter those of the allies the new aircraft were again able to challenge allied aircraft , culminating in '' bloody april '' during the battle of arras cheesman 1960 , p the '' official '' list of claims by fokker pilots for the second half of 1915 was no more than 28 , many of them over french aircraft january 1916 brought thirteen claims , most of them against the french , followed by twenty more in february , the last month of the '' scourge '' proper their supposed object was the replacement of the b.e.2c with better aircraft but it took the form of an attack on the rfc command and the royal aircraft factory this aircraft had a modest performance but its superior manoeuvrability gave it an advantage over the , especially once a clamp , fixing the lewis gun pointing straight ahead , was installed the claims were not confirmed but research has shown that the first claim matches french records of a morane forced down on 1july near lunéville , with a wounded crew and a damaged engine , followed three days later by another 355 in the new fighters , pilots could make long , steep dives , aiming the fixed , synchronised machine-gun by aiming the aircraft
