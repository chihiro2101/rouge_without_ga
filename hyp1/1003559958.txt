one seeks the solution of a problem in the form of strings of numbers ( traditionally binary , although the best representations are usually those that reflect something about the problem being solved ) , by applying operators such as recombination and mutation ( sometimes one , sometimes both ) hunting search – a method inspired by the group hunting of some animals such as wolves that organize their position to surround the prey , each of them relative to the position of the others and especially that of their leader genetic programming – here the solutions are in the form of computer programs , and their fitness is determined by their ability to solve a computational problem merrikh-bayat , '' the runner-root algorithm : a metaheuristic for solving unimodal and multimodal optimization problems inspired by runners and roots of plants in nature '' , applied soft computing , vol memetic algorithm – a hybrid method , inspired by richard dawkins 's notion of a meme , it commonly takes the form of a population-based algorithm coupled with individual learning procedures capable of performing local refinements the runner-root algorithm ( rra ) is inspired by the function of runners and roots of plants in nature f ( first generation ) step two : repeat the following regenerational steps until termination : evaluate the fitness of each individual in the population ( time limit , sufficient fitness achieved , etc file : estimation of distribution algorithm animation.gif estimation of distribution algorithm over keane 's function file : two population ea animation.gif a two-population ea search of a bounded optima of simionescu 's function . ( 2015 ) , '' adaptive dimensional search : a new metaheuristic algorithm for discrete truss sizing optimization '' , computers and structures , 154 , 1–16 and gene expression programming successfully explores a genotype-phenotype system , where the genotype consists of linear multigenic chromosomes of fixed length and the phenotype consists of multiple expression trees or computer programs of different sizes and shapes reduce the probability of fatal mutations ) , and also may improve the evolvability of the organism similar techniques differ in genetic representation and other implementation details , and the nature of the particular applied problem evolution strategy – works with vectors of real numbers as representations of solutions , and typically uses self-adaptive mutation rates adaptive dimensional search – unlike nature-inspired metaheuristic techniques , an adaptive dimensional search algorithm does not implement any metaphor as an underlying principle evolutionary programming – similar to genetic programming , but the structure of the program is fixed and its numerical parameters are allowed to evolve
