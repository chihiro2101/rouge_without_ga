he said : '' in this well-known region where the rain occurs in winter and the summers are more or less dry , the dominant vegetation is of a sclerophyllous type and there is little or no natural grassland , though there are many kinds of grass applied by the inhabitants of the cape to any sort of small woodland growth that does not include timber trees '' ; in the current vernacular , this still is the effective sense of the word fynbos – which grows in a 100-to-200-km-wide coastal belt stretching from clanwilliam on the west coast to port elizabeth on the southeast coast – forms part of the cape floral kingdom , where it accounts for half of the surface area and 80 % of the plant species the diversity of fynbos plants is extremely high , with over 9,000 species of plants occurring in the area , around 6,200 of which are endemic , i.e south africa 's western cape has the vast majority of species with one estimate finding 8,550 species in 89,000 & nbsp ; km 2 , which is higher than that estimated for the malayan forests , 7,900 species in 132,000 & nbsp ; km 2 this is in an area of 46,000 & nbsp ; km 2 – by comparison , the netherlands , with an area of 33,000 & nbsp ; km 2 , has 1,400 species , none of them endemic thus , although the fynbos covers only 6 % of the area of southern africa , it has half the species on the subcontinent – and in fact has almost 1 in 5 of all african plant species so far described five main river systems traverse the cape floral kingdom : the olifants river ( western cape ) ; the berg river which drains the west coast forelands plain stretching from the cape flats to the olifants ; the breede , which is the largest river on the cape ; the olifants river ( southern cape ) ; gourits and the groot rivers which drain the little karoo basin and the south coast forelands ; and the baviaanskloof and gamtoos rivers to the east several plant families are conspicuous in fynbos ; the proteaceae are prominent , with genera such as protea , leucospermum ( the '' pincushions '' ) , and leucadendron ( the silver tree and '' cone bushes '' ) the fynbos is home to many unique and endemic animals , with 7 species of endemic bird and an unknown number of endemic reptiles , amphibians , and arthropods the fynbos area has been divided into two very similar ecoregions : the lowland fynbos ( below 300 m above sea level ) on the sandy soil of the west coast , and the montane fynbos of the cape fold belt the ecoregion has been subdivided into 9 areas : the west coast forelands from the cape flats to the olifants river ( western cape ) ; the warm bokkeveld basin around the town of ceres ; the elgin valley around the town of elgin ; the sandy agulhas plain on the coast ; the breede river valley around the town of worcester ; the south coast forelands from caledon west to mossel bay ; the south-eastern end of the little karoo ; langkloof valley ; and the southeastern coast forelands west from tsitsikamma to port elizabeth particular types of lowland fynbos include the shrubs and herbs of the coastal sand dunes , the mixture of ericoids and restoids with thickets of shrubs such as maytenus , and other celastraceae , sideroxylons and other sapotaceae , and rhus and other anacardiaceae on the coastal sands ; the classic fynbos of the sandplains of the west coast forelands , and the agulhas plain ; the grassy fynbos of the hillier and wetter areas of the south and south-eastern coast forelands ; areas where fynbos and renosterveld are mixed ; coastal renosterveld on the west and south coast forelands ; and the inland renosterveld of the drier inland little karoo and warm bokkeveld the region includes the mountains in the west from the cape peninsula to the kouebokkeveld mountains , the south coast hinterland from elgin to port elizabeth , the mountains north of the little karoo from laingsburg to willowmore , and the inselberg hills within the little karoo
