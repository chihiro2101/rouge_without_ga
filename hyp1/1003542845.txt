the diminutive site on the east river necessitated a rockefeller center-type vertical complex , thus , it was a given that the secretariat would be housed in a tall office tower rather than hold a competition for the design of the facilities for the headquarters , the un decided to commission a multinational team of leading architects to collaborate on the design niemeyer 's project 32 was finally chosen , but as opposed to corbusier 's project 23 , which consisted of one building containing both the assembly hall and the councils in the center of the site ( as it was hierarchically the most important building ) , niemeyer 's plan split the councils from the assembly hall , locating the first alongside the river , and the second on the right side of the secretariat le corbusier 's project 23 consisted of a large block containing both the assembly hall and the council chambers near the center of the site with the secretariat tower emerging as a slab from the south niemeyer 's plan was closer to that actually constructed , with a distinctive general assembly building , a long low horizontal block housing the other meeting rooms , and a tall tower for the secretariat the un headquarters was originally proposed alongside a grand boulevard leading eastward from third avenue or lexington avenue , between 46th street to the south and 49th street to the north wallace harrison 's assistant , architect george dudley , later stated : '' it literally took our breath away to see the simple plane of the site kept open from first avenue to the river , only three structures on it , standing free , a fourth lying low behind them along the river ’ s edge.niemeyer also said , ‘ beauty will come from the buildings being in the right space ! ’ , curves of irreverence , yale later on , corbusier came once again to niemeyer and asked him to reposition the assembly hall back to the center of the site louis , missouri ; boston , massachusetts ; chicago , illinois ; fairfield county , connecticut ; westchester county and flushing meadows–corona park in new york ; tuskahoma , oklahoma ; the black hills of south dakota ; belle isle in detroit , michigan ; and a site on navy island straddling the u.s.-canada border were considered as potential sites for the un headquarters san francisco , where the un was founded in 1945 , was favored by australia , new zealand , china , and the philippines due to the city 's proximity to their countries the un and many of its delegates seriously considered philadelphia for the headquarters ; the city offered to donate land in several select sites , including fairmount park , andorra , and a center city location which would have placed the headquarters along a mall extending from independence hall to penn 's landing prior to the construction of the current complex , the un was headquartered at a temporary location at the sperry corporation 's offices in lake success , new york , an eastern suburb of the city in nassau county on long island , from 1946 to 1952 after the un moved to its new manhattan headquarters , the building was remodeled and briefly used as a pavilion for the 1964 new york world 's fair , after which it reverted to use as a skating rink until 2008 , when the entire building began a long-term renovation to create expanded museum facilities of the 65 & nbsp ; million , 25 & nbsp ; million was to be made available immediately from the reconstruction finance corporation however , the full loan was initially withheld due to a case regarding un employee valentin gubitchev and a kgb spy judith coplon , who had been charged with espionage and were set to go on trial in march 1949 the house was loath to distribute the full 65 & nbsp ; million because the government was concerned that the un 's proposed headquarters would grant diplomatic immunity to the two individuals to save money , the un considered retaining an existing building on the manhattan site , which had been slated for demolition once the headquarters was completed fuller , turner , slattery , and walsh , a consortium of four contracting companies from manhattan and queens , were selected to construct the secretariat building , as well as the foundations for the remaining buildings until then , the un had avoided the subject of a prayer room , because it had been difficult , if not impossible , to create a prayer room that could accommodate the various religions the consortium working on the secretariat building announced that 13,000 tons of steel would eventually be used in the building , and that the steelwork would consist of a strong wind brace system because the structure was so narrow the secretariat building was to be completed no later than january 1 , 1951 , and if the consortium of fuller , turner , slattery , and walsh exceeded that deadline , they had to pay a minimum penalty of 2,500 per day to the un this steel would be used to build the rest of the complex , as well as a deck over fdr drive on the headquarters ' eastern side the project also included a four-lane , 2.28 & nbsp ; million vehicular tunnel under first avenue so that traffic could bypass the headquarters when the un was in session in october 1949 , contracts were awarded for the construction of two vehicular ramps over the fdr drive : one to the north of the un headquarters , and one to the south in february 1950 , the un invited companies from 37 countries to bid on 2 & nbsp ; million worth of furniture for the secretariat building a 1.7 & nbsp ; million steel contract on the united nations general assembly building , the last structure to be built , was awarded in april 1950 at the time , the building was not expected to be complete until 1952 due to a steelworkers ' strike , which had delayed the production of steel at the time , much of the secretariat building was still unfinished , and the bulk of the un 's operations still remained at lake success the construction of the general assembly building was delayed due to a shortage of limestone for the building , which in turn resulted from a heavy snow at the british limestone quarries that were supplying the building 's limestone by 1955 , the collection was housed in the secretariat building and held 250,000 volumes in '' every language of the world '' , according to the new york times the east river-turtle bay fund , a civic group , proposed that the united nations purchase a tract located to the south of the headquarters , on the site of the robert moses playground and the queens–midtown tunnel ventilation building between 41st and 42nd streets it entailed closing first avenue between 43rd and 45th streets ;
