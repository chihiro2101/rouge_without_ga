citeseer x is a public search engine and digital library and repository for scientific and academic papers primarily with a focus on computer and information science it continues to support the goals outlined by citeseer to actively crawl and harvest academic and scientific documents on the public web and to use a citation inquiry by citations and ranking of documents by the impact of citations it had a representative sampling of research documents in computer and information science but was limited in coverage because it was limited to papers that are publicly available , usually at an author 's homepage , or those submitted by an author because citeseer only indexes freely available papers on the web and does not have access to publisher metadata , it returns fewer citation counts than sites , such as google scholar , that have publisher metadata its new modular open source architecture and software ( available previously on sourceforge but now on github ) is built on apache solr and other apache and open source tools which allows it to be a testbed for new algorithms in document harvesting , ranking , indexing , and information extraction as such citation counts in citeseer x are usually less than those in google scholar and microsoft academic search who have access to publisher metadata released in 2008 , it was loosely based on the previous citeseer search engine and digital library and is built with a new open source infrastructure , seersuite , and new algorithms and their implementations citeseer x crawls publicly available scholarly documents primarily from author webpages and other open resources , and does not have access to publisher metadata citeseer x data is regularly shared under a creative commons license with researchers worldwide and has been and is used in many experiments and competitions for enhanced access , performance and research , similar versions of citeseer were supported at universities such as the massachusetts institute of technology , university of z√ºrich and the national university of singapore
