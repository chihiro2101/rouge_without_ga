in an 1858 paper for the proceedings of the linnean society , british zoologist philip sclater first identified six terrestrial zoogeographic realms of the world : palaearctic , aethiopian/afrotropic , indian/indomalayan , australasian , nearctic , and neotropical the boreal and temperate euro-siberian region is the palearctic 's largest biogeography region , which transitions from tundra in the northern reaches of russia and scandinavia to the vast taiga , the boreal coniferous forests which run across the continent the lands bordering the mediterranean sea in southern europe , north africa , and western asia are home to the mediterranean basin ecoregions , which together constitute the world 's largest and most diverse mediterranean climate region of the world , with generally mild , rainy winters and hot , dry summers the mediterranean basin is also one of the world 's most endangered biogeographic regions ; only 4 % of the region 's original vegetation remains , and human activities , including overgrazing , deforestation , and conversion of lands for pasture , agriculture , and urbanization , have degraded much of the region formerly the region was mostly covered with forests and woodlands , but heavy human use has reduced much of the region to the sclerophyll shrublands known as chaparral , matorral , maquis , or garrigue this scheme includes these desert ecoregions in the palearctic realm ; other biogeographers identify the realm boundary as the transition zone between the desert ecoregions and the mediterranean basin ecoregions to the north , which places the deserts in the afrotropic , while others place the boundary through the middle of the desert in the subtropical region of southern china and southern edge of the himalayas , the palearctic temperate forests transition to the subtropical and tropical forests of indomalaya , creating a rich and diverse mix of plant and animal species the realm contains several important freshwater ecoregions as well , including the heavily developed rivers of europe , the rivers of russia , which flow into the arctic , baltic , black , and caspian seas , siberia 's lake baikal , the oldest and deepest lake on the planet , and japan 's ancient lake biwa several mammal species originated in the palearctic and spread to the nearctic during the ice age , including the brown bear ( ursus arctos , known in north america as the grizzly ) , red deer ( cervus elaphus ) in europe and the closely related elk ( cervus canadensis ) in far eastern siberia , american bison ( bison bison ) , and reindeer ( rangifer tarandus , known in north america as the caribou )
