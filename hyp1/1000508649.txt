in the 20th century , schumpeter and others proposed a typology of business cycles according to their periodicity , so that a number of particular cycles were named after their discoverers or proposers : the kitchin cycle of 3 to 5 years ( after joseph kitchin ) the juglar fixed investment cycle of 7 to 11 years ( often identified as '' the '' business cycle the kuznets swing of 15 to 25 years ( after simon kuznets – also called '' building cycle '' ) the kondratiev wave or long technological cycle of 45 to 60 years ( after the soviet economist nikolai kondratiev ) some say interest in the different typologies of cycles has waned since the development of modern macroeconomics , which gives little support to the idea of regular periodic cycles one alternative theory is that the primary cause of economic cycles is due to the credit cycle : the net expansion of credit ( increase in private credit , equivalently debt , as a percentage of gdp ) yields economic expansions , while the net contraction causes recessions , and if it persists , depressions mainstream economists working in the neoclassical tradition , as opposed to the keynesian tradition , have usually viewed the departures of the harmonic working of the market economy as due to exogenous influences , such as the state or its regulations , labor unions , business monopolies , or shocks due to technology or natural causes the fluctuations in wages are almost the same as in the level of employment ( wage cycle lags one period behind the employment cycle ) , for when the economy is at high employment , workers are able to demand rises in wages , whereas in periods of high unemployment , wages tend to fall the view of the economic cycle as caused exogenously dates to say 's law , and much debate on endogeneity or exogeneity of causes of the economic cycle is framed in terms of refuting or supporting say 's law ; this is also referred to as the '' general glut '' ( supply in relation to demand ) debate new york , national bureau of economic research , 1951 in the united states , it is generally accepted that the national bureau of economic research ( nber ) is the final arbiter of the dates of the peaks and troughs of the business cycle irwin , 1955 later , economist joseph schumpeter argued that a juglar cycle has four stages : expansion ( increase in production and prices , low interest rates ) crisis ( stock exchanges crash and multiple bankruptcies of firms occur ) recession ( drops in prices and in output , high interest-rates ) recovery ( stocks recover because of the fall in prices and incomes ) schumpeter 's juglar model associates recovery and prosperity with increases in productivity , consumer confidence , aggregate demand , and prices in the heterodox marxian view , profit is the major engine of the market economy , but business ( capital ) profitability has a tendency to fall that recurrently creates crises in which mass unemployment occurs , businesses fail , remaining capital is centralized and concentrated and profitability is recovered goodwin formalised a marxist model of business cycles known as the goodwin model in which recession was caused by increased bargaining power of workers ( a result of high employment in boom periods ) pushing up the wage share of national income , suppressing profits and leading to a breakdown in capital accumulation within mainstream economics , keynesian views have been challenged by real business cycle models in which fluctuations are due to random changes in the total productivity factor ( which are caused by changes in technology as well as the legal and regulatory environment ) there is often a close timing relationship between the upper turning points of the business cycle , commodity prices , and freight rates , which is shown to be particularly tight in the grand peak years of 1873 , 1889 , 1900 and 1912 one of the criticisms of the austrian business cycle theory is based on the observation that the united states suffered recurrent economic crises in the 19th century , notably the panic of 1873 , which occurred prior to the establishment of a u.s the 19th-century school of underconsumptionism also posited endogenous causes for the business cycle , notably the paradox of thrift , and today this previously heterodox school has entered the mainstream in the form of keynesian economics via the keynesian revolution friedman has gone so far as to argue that all the central bank of a country should do is to avoid making large mistakes , as he believes they did by contracting the money supply very rapidly in the face of the wall street crash of 1929 , in which they made what would have been a recession into the great depression . within economics , it has been debated as to whether or not the fluctuations of a business cycle are attributable to external ( exogenous ) versus internal ( endogenous ) causes '' over production and under consumption '' , scarlett , history of economic theory and thought prior to that point classical economics had either denied the existence of business cycles , blamed them on external factors , notably war , or only studied the long term the theory originates from the work of raymond vernon , who described the development of international trade in terms of product life-cycle – a period of time during which the product circulates in the market the amplitude of the variations in economic output depends on the level of the investment , for investment determines the level of aggregate output ( multiplier ) , and is determined by aggregate demand ( accelerator ) sismondi and his contemporary robert owen , who expressed similar but less systematic thoughts in 1817 report to the committee of the association for the relief of the manufacturing poor , both identified the cause of economic cycles as overproduction and underconsumption , caused in particular by wealth inequality until the keynesian revolution in mainstream economics in the wake of the great depression , classical and neoclassical explanations ( exogenous causes ) were the mainstream explanation of economic cycles ; following the keynesian revolution , neoclassical macroeconomics was largely rejected over the period since the industrial revolution , technological progress has had a much larger effect on the economy than any fluctuations in credit or debt , the primary exception being the great depression , which caused a multi-year steep economic decline ) , and kitchin cycles are characterized by change in the society preferences ( tastes ) for consumer goods , and time , which is necessary to start the production this period started from the end of the napoleonic wars in 1815 , which was immediately followed by the post-napoleonic depression in the united kingdom ( 1815–30 ) , and culminated in the great depression of 1929–39 , which led into world war ii this debate has important policy consequences : proponents of exogenous causes of crises such as neoclassicals largely argue for minimal government policy or regulation ( laissez faire ) , as absent these external shocks , the market functions , while proponents of endogenous causes of crises such as keynesians largely argue for larger government policy and regulation , as absent regulation , the market will move from crisis to crisis stock market cycles 1942–1995 economic stabilization policy using fiscal policy and monetary policy appeared to have dampened the worst excesses of business cycles , and automatic stabilization due to the aspects of the government 's budget also helped mitigate the cycle even without conscious action by policy-makers adherents of the austrian school , such as the historian thomas woods , argue that these earlier financial crises were prompted by government and bankers ' efforts to expand credit despite restraints imposed by the prevailing gold standard , and are thus consistent with austrian business cycle theory by contrast , some economists , notably new classical economics robert lucas , argue that the welfare cost of business cycles are very small to negligible , and that governments should focus on long-term growth instead of stabilization henryk grossmann das akkumulations – und zusammenbruchsgesetz des kapitalistischen systems ( zugleich eine krisentheorie ) , hirschfeld , leipzig , 1929 some marxist authors such as rosa luxemburg viewed the lack of purchasing power of workers as a cause of a tendency of supply to be larger than demand , creating crisis , in a model that has similarities with the keynesian one their models show that when the difference between short-term interest rates ( they use 3-month t-bills ) and long-term interest rates ( 10-year treasury bonds ) at the end of a federal reserve tightening cycle is negative or less than 93 basis points positive that a rise in unemployment usually occurs the nber identifies a recession as '' a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy , lasting more than a few months , normally visible in real gdp , real income , employment , industrial production '' this division is not absolute – some classicals ( including say ) argued for government policy to mitigate the damage of economic cycles , despite believing in external causes , while austrian school economists argue against government involvement as only worsening crises , despite believing in internal causes eventually , the boom can not be sustained and is followed by a '' bust '' in which the malinvestments are liquidated ( sold for less than their original cost ) and the money supply contracts since the 1940s , following the keynesian revolution , most governments of developed nations have seen the mitigation of the business cycle as part of the responsibility of government , under the rubric of stabilization policy copied from wikipedia article intellectual capital the impact of intellectual capital on a firm ’ s stock return evidence from indonesia ari barkah djamil , dominique razafindrambinina , caroline tandeans journal of business studies quarterly 2013 , volume 5 , number 2 in recent years economic theory has moved towards the study of economic fluctuation rather than a '' business cycle '' – though some economists use the phrase 'business cycle ' as a convenient shorthand according to austrian economists , excessive issuance of bank credit may be exacerbated if central bank monetary policy sets interest rates too low , and the resulting expansion of the money supply causes a '' boom '' in which resources are misallocated or malinvestment because of artificially low interest rates many social indicators , such as mental health , crimes , and suicides , worsen during economic recessions ( though general mortality tends to fall , and it is in expansions when it tends to increase ) the second declaration was in the early 2000s , following the stability and growth in the 1980s and 1990s in what came to be known as the great moderation austrians claim that the boom-and-bust business cycle is caused by government intervention into the economy , and that the cycle would be comparatively rare and mild without central government interference in particular , the bursting of speculative bubbles is seen as the proximate cause of depressions , and this theory places finance and banks at the center of the business cycle 421 , 2010 when the yield curve is inverted banks are often caught paying more on short-term deposits ( or other forms of short-term wholesale funding ) than they are making on long-term loans leading to a loss of profitability and reluctance to lend resulting in a credit crunch periodic crises in capitalism formed the basis of the theory of karl marx , who further claimed that these crises were increasing in severity and , on the basis of which , he predicted a communist revolution the explanation of fluctuations in aggregate economic activity is one of the primary concerns of macroeconomics and a variety of theories have been proposed to explain them in 1927 , eugen slutzky observed that summing random numbers , such as the last digits of the russian state lottery , could generate patterns akin to that we see in business cycles , an observation that has since been repeated many times contrarily , in the heterodox tradition of jean charles léonard de sismondi , clément juglar , and marx the recurrent upturns and downturns of the market system are an endogenous characteristic of it since in the keynesian view , recessions are caused by inadequate aggregate demand , when a recession occurs the government should increase the amount of aggregate demand and bring the economy back into equilibrium highly competitive market conditions would determine simultaneous technological updates of all economic agents ( as a result , cycle formation ) : in case if a manufacturing technology at an enterprise does not meet the current technological environment , – such company loses its competitiveness and eventually goes bankrupt the political business cycle theory is strongly linked to the name of michał kalecki who discussed '' the reluctance of the 'captains of industry ' to accept government intervention in the matter of employment '' while credit causes have not been a primary theory of the economic cycle within the mainstream , they have gained occasional mention , such as , cited approvingly by according to keynesian economics , fluctuations in aggregate demand cause the economy to come to short run equilibrium at levels that are different from the full employment rate of output
