the fundamental techniques , such as those used to solve the keplerian problem ( determining position as a function of time ) , are therefore the same in both fields isaac newton published more general laws of celestial motion in the first edition of philosophi√¶ naturalis principia mathematica ( 1687 ) , which gave a method for finding the orbit of a body following a parabola path from three observations the specific example discussed is of a satellite orbiting a planet , but the rules of thumb could also apply to other situations , such as orbits of small bodies around a star such as the sun a satellite in a low orbit ( or low part of an elliptical orbit ) moves more quickly with respect to the surface of the planet than a satellite in a higher orbit ( or a high part of an elliptical orbit ) , due to the stronger gravitational attraction closer to the planet from a circular orbit , thrust applied in a direction opposite to the satellite 's motion changes orbit to elliptical ; the satellite will descend and reach the lowest orbital point ( the periapse ) at 180 degrees away from the firing point ; then it will ascend back kepler 's laws of planetary motion , which can be mathematically derived from newton 's laws , hold strictly only in describing the motion of two gravitating bodies in the absence of non-gravitational forces ; they also describe parabolic and hyperbolic trajectories the fundamental laws of astrodynamics are newton 's law of universal gravitation and newton 's laws of motion , while the fundamental mathematical tool is differential calculus standard assumptions in astrodynamics include non-interference from outside bodies , negligible mass for one of the bodies , and negligible other forces ( such as from the solar wind , atmospheric drag , etc kepler 's laws of planetary motion may be derived from newton 's laws , when it is assumed that the orbiting body is subject only to the gravitational force of the central attractor the universal variable formulation works well with the variation of parameters technique , except now , instead of the six keplerian orbital elements , we use a different set of orbital elements : namely , the satellite 's initial position and velocity vectors x_0 and v_0 at a given epoch t 0 equatorial bulges cause precession of the node and the perigee tesseral harmonics of the gravity field introduce additional perturbations lunar and solar gravity perturbations alter the orbits atmospheric drag reduces the semi-major axis unless make-up thrust is used over very long timescales ( perhaps millions of orbits ) , even small perturbations can dominate , and the behaviour can become chaotic on the other hand , the various perturbations can be orchestrated by clever astrodynamicists to assist with orbit maintenance tasks , such as station-keeping , ground track maintenance or adjustment , or phasing of perigee to cover selected targets at low altitude using low thrust engines ( such as electrical propulsion ) , if the initial orbit is supersynchronous to the final desired circular orbit then the optimal transfer orbit is achieved by thrusting continuously in the direction of the velocity at apogee as the objective is to change the direction of the velocity vector by an angle equal to the angle between the planes , almost all of this thrust should be made when the spacecraft is at the node near the apoapse , when the magnitude of the velocity vector is at its lowest however , a small fraction of the orbital inclination change can be made at the node near the periapse , by slightly angling the transfer orbit injection thrust in the direction of the desired inclination change this works because the cosine of a small angle is very nearly one , resulting in the small plane change being effectively '' free '' despite the high velocity of the spacecraft near periapse , as the oberth effect due to the increased , slightly angled thrust exceeds the cost of the thrust in the orbit-normal axis due to newton 's third law ( equal and opposite reaction ) , any momentum gained by a spacecraft must be lost by the planet , or vice versa however , because the planet is much , much more massive than the spacecraft , the effect on the planet 's orbit is negligible it is now possible to use computers to search for routes using the nonlinearities in the gravity of the planets and moons of the solar system collectively referred to as the interplanetary transport network , these highly perturbative , even chaotic , orbital trajectories in principle need no fuel beyond that needed to reach the lagrange point ( in practice keeping to the trajectory requires some course corrections )
