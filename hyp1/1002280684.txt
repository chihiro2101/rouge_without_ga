from around 1850 to 1980 , most geologists endorsed uniformitarianism ( '' the present is the key to the past '' ) and gradualism ( geologic change occurs slowly over long periods of time ) and rejected the idea that cataclysmic events such as earthquakes , volcano , or floods of vastly greater power than those observed at the present time , played any significant role in the formation of the earth 's surface uniformitarian explanations for the formation of sedimentary rock and an understanding of the immense stretch of geological time , or as the concept came to be known deep time , were found in the writing of james hutton , sometimes known as the father of geology , in the late 18th century the geologist charles lyell built upon hutton 's ideas during the first half of 19th century and amassed observations in support of the uniformitarian idea that the earth 's features had been shaped by same geological processes that could be observed in the present acting gradually over an immense period of time in the early development of geology , efforts were made in a predominantly christian western society to reconcile biblical narratives of creation and the universal flood with new concepts about the processes which had formed the earth in fact cuvier , influenced by the ideas of the enlightenment and the intellectual climate of the french revolution , avoided religious or metaphysical speculation in his scientific writings since then , the debate about the extinction of the dinosaurs and other mass extinction events has centered on whether the extinction mechanism was the asteroid impact , widespread volcanism ( which occurred about the same time ) , or some other mechanism or combination he speculated that the planet venus is a former '' comet '' which was ejected from jupiter and subsequently 3,500 years ago made two catastrophic close passes by earth , 52 years apart , and later interacted with mars , which then had a series of near collisions with earth which ended in 687 bce , before settling into its current orbit velikovsky used this to explain the biblical plagues of egypt , the biblical reference to the '' sun standing still '' for a day ( joshua 10:12 & 13 , explained by changes in earth 's rotation ) , and the sinking of atlantis instead they believed that the earth had been shaped by the long term action of forces such as volcanism , earthquakes , erosion , and sedimentation , that could still be observed in action today lyell presented his ideas in the influential three volume work , principles of geology , published in the 1830s , which challenged theories about geological cataclysms proposed by proponents of catastrophism like cuvier and buckland cuvier also believed that the stratigraphic record indicated that there had been several of these revolutions , which he viewed as recurring natural events , amid long intervals of stability during the history of life on earth he frequently cited cuvier 's work , even though cuvier had proposed an inundation of limited geographic extent and extended duration , whereas buckland , to be consistent with the biblical account , was advocating a universal flood of short duration
