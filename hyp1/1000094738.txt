it is not known when the game of liubo originated , although according to legend it was invented by wu cao ( 烏曹 , called wu zhou 烏胄 in the early 2nd century ce shuowen jiezi dictionary ) , a minister to king jie , the last king of the xia dynasty , who according to traditional chronology reigned 1728–1675 bce for example , the records of the grand historian records a speech made during the reign of king xuan of qi ( reigned 319–301 bce ) that claims that the capital city of linzi was so wealthy that its citizens were all able to indulge in activities such as playing musical instruments , cockfighting , dog racing , playing liubo and playing cuju the game reached its greatest popularity during the han dynasty , as is evidenced by the discovery of many examples of liubo boards or sets of liubo game pieces as grave goods in high status tombs dating to the han dynasty engraved picture stones ( 畫像石 ) and moulded picture bricks ( 畫像磚 ) that were widely used to decorate tombs and temples during the eastern han period ( 25–220 ce ) also frequently depict people playing liubo , sometimes as a small part of a complex scene depicting many different activities , but sometimes as the focal point of the scene , with the players attended by servants and playing in the cool of a pavilion by the time of the yuan dynasty ( 1271–1368 ) all knowledge of the game of liubo had been lost , and it is only with the archeological discoveries of recent years that the game has become better known regardless of their size or shape , the common feature of all liubo boards is the distinctive pattern that is carved or painted on their surface : all excavated boards have the angular v-shaped marks at the corners and l-shaped marks at the center of the edges , as well as the central square and t-shaped protrusions , and most boards also have four marks ( usually circular but sometimes a decorative pattern ) between the corner mark and the central square in many tombs only the liubo board has survived ( especially if made of stone or bronze ) , and it can be assumed that any associated game pieces have decayed , whereas in other cases the game pieces ( which are often made of ivory ) have survived but the liubo board ( which is often made of wood or lacquer ) has rotted away however , in 1973 a unique , complete set of liubo equipment in a lacquer box was discovered in a 2nd-century bce tomb at mawangdui ( believed to be that of the son of the marquis of dai ) long ) 象削一 1 eighteen-sided die with the numbers '' 1 '' through '' 16 '' and characters meaning '' win '' and '' lose '' not listed in the inventory the six black and six white game pieces are the main game pieces to be moved around the board , and similar sets of cubic or cuboid game pieces made from ivory , jadeite or rock crystal have been found in several other tombs most han stone pictures of liubo show the players throwing sticks onto a mat between themselves ( with the liubo board to the side of the mat ) , and ceramic model liubo sets such as the one excavated in 1972 from lingbao in henan province show six sticks lined up neatly between the two players however , the twenty ivory game pieces and the eighteen-sided die in the mawangdui set are not typically associated with liubo boards in other tombs , and it is possible that they were not used for playing liubo , but were equipment for a different game no liubo board or liubo game pieces were found in the tomb , and because of the inscription '' take a drink '' ( 酒來 ) on one face of the die , the die and sets of tokens are supposed to have been used for a drinking game the most complete description of the rules of liubo occurs in a quotation from the lost book of ancient bo ( 古博經 ) in a commentary by zhang zhan ( 張湛 ) to the liezi that was written during the jin dynasty ( 265–420 ) : method of play : two people sit facing each other over a board , and the board is divided into twelve paths , with two ends , and an area called the '' water '' in the middle another , somewhat later source , the family instructions of master yan by yan zhitui ( 531–591 ) states that there were two variants of liubo , '' greater bo '' ( 大博 ) which was played with six throwing sticks , and '' lesser bo '' ( 小博 ) which was played with two dice : the ancient greater bo used six sticks , whereas lesser bo used two dice zhou zheng has pointed out that one tlv mirror dating to the reign of wang mang ( 9–23 ) has an inscription that includes the words '' carved with a liubo board pattern to dispel misfortune '' ( 刻具博局去祛不羊祥 ) , which suggests that the main purpose of the liubo pattern on mirrors was ritual , and that the pattern had a special significance beyond game-playing the liubo diagram is too small to have been used for playing liubo , and is covered with the sixty terms of the sexagenary cycle which are written all along the lines of the liubo diagram , in a similar way that the turtle diagram on the other side of the board is filled with the sixty terms the prognostications under the liubo diagram are headed with one of nine terms that correspond to the words of an enigmatic , mnemonic rhyme about liubo written by xu bochang ( 許博昌 ) during the reign of emperor wu of han ( 141–87 bce ) ; lillian tseng ( zeng lanying ) argues that these are the names for particular points on the board ( the two lines of the '' v '' mark , the two lines of the '' l '' mark , the two lines of the '' t '' mark , the circle or line between the corner and the central square , the outside edge of the central square , and the inside of the central square ) however , lillian tseng points out that the divination could also be done the other way round , by looking for the desired prognostication ( for example an auspicious marriage day ) , and then all the days on the liubo board that were written on the position corresponding to the term heading the prognostication would match the desired prognostication it has been theorized that the placement of the sixty sexagenary terms on the points of the liubo divination diagram indicate the possible positions for placing pieces when playing liubo , and that the sequence of the terms across the divination diagram reflects the path to be followed around the board when playing the game ( starting at the north-east corner and ending at the north side of the central square ) once when the two of them were playing liubo a message came that the beacons on the northern border had been lit ; king anxi wanted to stop the game and discuss the situation with his ministers , but his brother told him not to worry as it was only the king of zhao on a hunting trip , and so they continued playing
