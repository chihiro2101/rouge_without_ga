the term chiaroscuro originated during the renaissance as drawing on coloured paper , where the artist worked from the paper 's base tone toward light using white gouache , and toward dark using ink , bodycolour or watercolour the term broadened in meaning early on to cover all strong contrasts in illumination between light and dark areas in art , which is now the primary meaning the more technical use of the term chiaroscuro is the effect of light modelling in painting , drawing , or printmaking , where three-dimensional volume is suggested by the value gradation of colour and the analytical division of light and shadow shapes—often called '' shading '' although few ancient greek paintings survive , their understanding of the effect of light modelling still may be seen in the late-fourth-century bc mosaics of pella , macedonia , in particular the stag hunt mosaic , in the house of the abduction of helen , inscribed gnosis epoesen , or 'knowledge did it ' the technique also survived in rather crude standardized form in byzantine art and was refined again in the middle ages to become standard by the early fifteenth-century in painting and manuscript illumination in italy and flanders , and then spread to all western art , rome ( series '' artistic centers of the italian renaissance '' ) , pp.148-150 , 2005 , cambridge university press , 2005 , , 9780521624459 , google books the raphael painting illustrated , with light coming from the left , demonstrates both delicate modelling chiaroscuro to give volume to the body of the model , and strong chiaroscuro in the more common sense , in the contrast between the well-lit model and the very dark background of foliage the term is mostly used to describe compositions where at least some principal elements of the main composition show the transition between light and dark , as in the baglioni and geertgen tot sint jans paintings illustrated above and below chiaroscuro modelling is now taken for granted , but it has had some opponents ; namely : the english portrait miniaturist nicholas hilliard cautioned in his treatise on painting against all but the minimal use we see in his works , reflecting the views of his patron queen elizabeth i of england : '' seeing that best to show oneself needeth no shadow of place but rather the open light 1600 , in nicholas hilliard , roy strong , 2002 , p.24 , michael joseph ltd , london , in drawings and prints , modelling chiaroscuro often is achieved by the use of hatching , or shading by parallel lines chiaroscuro woodcuts are old master prints in woodcut using two or more blocks printed in different colours ; they do not necessarily feature strong contrasts of light and dark despite vasari 's claim for italian precedence in ugo da carpi , it is clear that his , the first italian examples , date to around 1516 landau and parshall , 150 but other sources suggest , the first chiaroscuro woodcut to be the triumph of julius caesar , which was created by andrea mantegna , an italian painter , between 1470 and 1500 1523 ) , giovanni baglione ( 1566–1643 ) , and caravaggio ( 1571–1610 ) , the last of whom was crucial in developing the style of tenebrism , where dramatic chiaroscuro becomes a dominant stylistic device the french use of the term , clair-obscur , was introduced by the seventeenth-century art-critic roger de piles in the course of a famous argument ( débat sur le coloris ) , on the relative merits of drawing and colour in painting ( his dialogues sur le coloris , 1673 , le rubénisme en europe aux xviie et xviiie siècles , volume 16 of museums at the crossroads , michèle-caroline heck , university of michigan , brepols , 2005 was a key contribution to the débat ) especially since the strong twentieth-century rise in the reputation of caravaggio , in non-specialist use the term is mainly used for strong chiaroscuro effects such as his , or rembrandt 's as the tate puts it : '' chiaroscuro is generally only remarked upon when it is a particularly prominent feature of the work , usually when the artist is using extreme contrasts of light and shade '' 1984 when informed that no lens currently had a wide enough aperture to shoot a costume drama set in grand palaces using only candlelight , kubrick bought and retrofitted a special lens for these purposes : a modified mitchell bnc camera and a zeiss lens manufactured for the rigors of space photography , with a maximum aperture of f/.7 sven nykvist , the longtime collaborator of ingmar bergman , also informed much of his photography with chiaroscuro realism , as did gregg toland , who influenced such cinematographers as lászló kovács , vilmos zsigmond , and vittorio storaro with his use of deep and selective focus augmented with strong horizon-level key lighting penetrating through windows and doorways much of the celebrated film noir tradition relies on techniques toland perfected in the early thirties that are related to chiaroscuro ( though high-key lighting , stage lighting , frontal lighting , and other effects are interspersed in ways that diminish the chiaroscuro claim ) 1658 , by johannes vermeer , whose use of light to model throughout his compositions is exceptionally complex and delicate chiaroscuro in modelling ;
