de havilland aviation ltd – restoring and preserving de havilland , and other , jets de havilland aircraft museum history of de havilland the de havilland comet , the first commercial airliner de havilland aeronautical technical school association the deal , which closed on 3 june 2019 following regulatory approval , brought the entire de havilland canada product line under the same banner for the first time in decades , under a new holding company bearing the original name , de havilland aircraft of canada limited to meet the demand for tiger moth trainers for the royal new zealand air force and potentially for raf training to be conducted in new zealand , the de havilland ( new zealand ) company limited was established in march 1939 , and work commenced on new zealand 's first aircraft factory at rongotai de havilland ( canada ) was eventually incorporated into the bombardier group of companies and the dash eight remains in production with a particular emphasis being placed on its quiet operation in comparison to other aircraft of a similar size this went against usual practice : usually engines are designed and produced by a dedicated company though in the uk the bristol aeroplane company had a substantial engine business and armstrong whitworth aircraft was part of the same business as armstrong siddeley after 1935 , both part of the hawker group with thomas 's help , de havilland took modest premises at the nearby stag lane aerodrome and formed a limited liability company , de havilland aircraft company limited , incorporated 26 september 1920 the de havilland comet was put into service in 1952 as the eagerly anticipated first commercial jet airliner , twice as fast as previous alternatives and a source of british national pride initially de havilland concentrated on single and two-seat biplanes , continuing the dh line of aircraft built by airco but adapting them for airline use , but then they introduced a series of smaller aircraft powered by de havilland 's own gipsy engines the de havilland company donated a site to hertfordshire county council for educational use : the site was then developed as hatfield technical college , which is now the college lane campus de havilland continued to produce high-performance aircraft including the twin piston-engined dh 88 comet racer , one of which became famous as the winner of the macrobertson air race from england to australia in 1934 the company moved from melbourne to sydney during 1930 where it acted as an agency for the parent company , with assembly , repair and spares facilities for the company 's popular sporting and airliner types because of the structural problems of the comet , in 1954 all remaining examples were withdrawn from service , with de havilland launching a major effort to build a new version that would be both larger and stronger the successful '' gipsy '' and the later developments such as the gipsy major were successful and popular power units , being used in nearly all of de havilland 's light designs and several aircraft from other manufacturers aircraft design and full manufacture by de havilland australia ( dha ) did not take place until the second world war , when the company began production of the dh 82 tiger moth primary trainer at bankstown , nsw 2 airco dh.1 2 seat pusher scout airco dh.2 pusher scout airco dh.3 twin

swallow ( 1946 ) autogyro cierva c.24 in 1937 de havilland set up a factory at what is now known as de havilland way in lostock to produce variable-pitch propeller for the raf one of de havilland 's trademarks was that the name of the aircraft type was painted on using a particularly elegant roman typeface , all in capital letters employing the services of frank halford then buying out his company they produced the de havilland goblin and de havilland ghost engines for first their jet fighters then the comet de havilland was purchased by hawker siddeley in 1960 and merged into british aerospace in 1978 the high-performance designs and wooden construction methods culminated in the mosquito , constructed primarily of wood , which avoided use of strategic materials such as aluminium during the second world war a company set up in 1935 for the manufacture of hamilton standard propellers under licence , and which later produced guided and other missiles such as the firestreak and blue streak the bae site then closed in 1993 , and the university of hertfordshire purchased part of the site for the de havilland campus to build moth aircraft for the training of canadian airmen and continued after the war to build its own designs suited to the harsh canadian environment de havilland 's final designs became the hawker siddeley trident ( originally the dh.121 ) and the innovative british aerospace 125 , originally the dh.125 by then the united states had its boeing 707 jet and the douglas dc-8 , both of which were faster and more economical to operate the dh 84 dragon was the first aeroplane purchased by aer lingus in 1936 ; they later operated the de havilland express and the dh 89 dragon rapide when there was a strike at the plant , the artisans who painted the name on the planes used the same typeface to make the workers ' protest signs after the second world war de havilland continued with advanced designs in both the military and civil fields , but several public disasters doomed the company as an independent entity
