whereas modern interframe video formats , such as mpeg1 , mpeg2 and h.264/mpeg-4 avc , achieve real-world compression ratios of 1:50 or better , m-jpeg 's lack of interframe prediction limits its efficiency to 1:20 or lower , depending on the tolerance to spatial artifacting in the compressed output as a purely intraframe compression scheme , the image quality of m-jpeg is directly a function of each video frame 's static ( spatial ) complexity it is neither hindered by highly random motion ( such as the water-surface turbulence in a large waterfall ) , nor helped by the absence of motion ( such as static landscape shot by tripod ) , which are two opposite extremes commonly used to test interframe video formats motion jpeg is simple to implement because it uses a mature compression standard ( jpeg ) with well-developed libraries , and it is an intraframe method of compression unlike the video formats specified in international standards such as mpeg-2 and the format specified in the jpeg still-picture coding standard , there is no document that defines a single exact format that is universally recognized as a complete specification of “ motion jpeg ” for use in all contexts for example , microsoft documents their standard format to store m-jpeg in avi files , apple documents how m-jpeg is stored in quicktime files , rfc 2435 describes how m-jpeg is implemented in an rtp stream , and an m-jpeg codecid is planned for the matroska file format m-jpeg is now used by video-capture devices such as digital cameras , ip cameras , and webcams , as well as by non-linear video editing systems it is natively supported by the quicktime player , the playstation console , and web browsers such as safari , google chrome , mozilla firefox and microsoft edge recent firmware updates to the nintendo 3ds can now record and play '' 3d-avi '' m-jpeg-encoded files , which is the same format used in the fujifilm finepix real 3d series , from a sd card in 320×240 resolution so long as the video duration is 10 minutes or less prior to the recent rise in mpeg-4 encoding in consumer devices , a progressive scan form of m-jpeg saw widespread use in the “ movie ” modes of digital still cameras , allowing video encoding and playback through the integrated jpeg compression hardware with only a software modification this video is typically stored in the popular windows avi or apple quicktime mov container files , generally viewable natively ( or after installation of a simple codec ) in most versions of the applicable operating system in addition to portable players ( which are mainly '' consumers '' of the video ) , many video-enabled digital cameras use m-jpeg for video-capture in response to a get request for a mjpeg file or stream , the server streams the sequence of jpeg frames over http
