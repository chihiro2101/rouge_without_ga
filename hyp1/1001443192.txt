in 1907 , the rabbit-proof fence was built in western australia between cape keraudren and esperance to try to control the spread of the rabbit population from the east into western australian pastoral areas frank tidswell , who was his chief australian collaborator , continued danysz 's trials after he left in 1907 , and also began trials of the yalgogrin , gundagai , and picton microbes ( named for the stations where infected rabbits were found ) , but financial support was lacking from the federal government , or the collaboration of affected states , that would be necessary to prove that the measure safe and effective dr brian cooke from csiro wildlife and ecology receiving the 2000 pol eureka prize for environmental research , for his lifetime commitment to reducing the devastation caused by rabbits on the australian environment the rabbit in australia ( 1979 ) australian broadcasting corporation land line australian broadcasting corporation rabbiting on – australian stories of experiences with the pest csiro protection for pet rabbits culture victoria – nox all rabbits video about rabbits and rabbit control in australia in 1906 and 1907 , jean danysz , of the pasteur institute of paris , conducted trials on broughton island , new south wales , of a strain of pasteurella bacteria he had developed , which proved to be specific to rabbits , but it proved to be a less-than-satisfactory control measure the success of the virus was found to be higher in dry areas , because of a benign calicivirus found in the colder , wetter areas of australia , which was immunising rabbits against the more virulent form upon arriving in australia , which had no native rabbit population , austin asked his nephew william austin in england to send him 12 grey rabbits , five hares , 72 partridges , and some sparrows so he could continue his hobby in australia by creating a local population of the species in july 1884 ernest james stevens , a member of the queensland legislative assembly , proposed that the queensland government erect a fence to prevent the infestation of rabbits in new south wales from spreading into queensland ( his logan electorate being very close to the new south wales border ) the virus escaped from a quarantine compound on wardang island , south australia , where the field tests were being carried out , and by late october 1995 , it was recorded in rabbits at yunta and gum creek , in north-eastern south australia in 1950 , following research conducted by frank fenner , myxoma virus was deliberately released into the rabbit population , causing it to drop from an estimated 600 & nbsp ; million the virus that stunned australia 's rabbits to around 100 & nbsp ; million although ferrets and other mustelid species are used as control measures , australia has significantly fewer wild mustelids to prey on the invasive rabbits while in their warrens or burrows compared to europe and the united states the population explosion was ascribed to the disappearance of native predators , but the emergence of a hardier breed by natural selection has subsequently been attributed to their spread these methods had limited success until the introduction of biological control methods in the latter half of the 20th century to combat that trend , over three years from june 1991 , the commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation ( csiro ) comprehensively tested the potential ofa calicivirus , which causes rabbit haemorrhagic disease ( rhd ) , for biological control of wild rabbits their population remained fairly stable until around 1866 , presumed to have been kept in check by native carnivores and were protected by an act of parliament , but by 1867 was out of control the current infestation appears to have originated with the release of 24 wild rabbits by thomas austin for hunting purposes in october 1859 , on his property , barwon park , near winchelsea , victoria and by 1866 , the geelong advertiser reported 50,000 having been killed by hunters as such , the number 1 rabbit-proof fence , which was erected in 1901 , failed to keep the rabbit population away from the protected area poisoning is probably the most widely used of the conventional techniques , as it requires the least effort , and capable of destroying a local population , though reinfestation given the mobility of the animal is almost inevitable '' sydney gazette 28 may 1831 in the 1840s , rabbit-keeping became even more common , with examples of the theft of rabbits from ordinary peoples ' houses appearing in court records and rabbits entering the diets of ordinary people the first of these , in sydney at least , was one built by alexander macleay at elizabeth bay house , '' a preserve or rabbit-warren , surrounded by a substantial stone wall , and well stocked with that choice game once the problem was understood , various control methods were tried to limit or reduce the population of rabbits in australia since their introduction from europe in the 19th century , the effect of rabbits on the ecology of australia has been devastating at the time , he had stated , '' the introduction of a few rabbits could do little harm and might provide a touch of home , in addition to a spot of hunting ''
