adams 's shortstop position , which he started playing at some time from 1849 to 1850 , was used to field throws from the outfielders and throw to the three infielders unlike the pitcher and catcher , who must start every play in a designated area ( the pitcher must be on the pitcher 's mound , with one foot in contact with the pitcher 's rubber , and the catcher must be behind home plate in the catcher 's box ) the shortstop and the other fielders can vary their positioning in response to what they anticipate will be the actions of the batter and runner ( s ) once the play begins because right-handed hitters tend to hit the ball more toward third base , a shortstop will generally move closer to third base if the batter is batting right-handed , and more toward first base if the batter is batting left-handed a shortstop typically has a strong throwing arm , because he has a relatively long throw to first base , and often has less time in which to make a throw , given that the ground balls he fields have often traveled relatively far a shortstop must also be extremely agile , because balls hit to or near the shortstop position are usually hit harder than to other infield positions shortstops are required to covering a base in double play situations when the ball is hit to the second baseman or first baseman they also cover second when a runner is attempting a stolen base , but only when a left-handed hitter is batting because the infield will respond to a left-handed batter by shifting toward first base , resulting in the shortstop being the infielder who is closest to second base shortstops also must cover third at various times , including the rotation play ; the latter occurs when there are runners on first and second and a sacrifice bunt is attempted toward third base , requiring the third baseman to move in away from third base in order to field it they often become the cutoff man on balls to any part of the outfield that are being directed towards third base and all balls to left and center field that are destined for second base some of the weakest hitters in major league baseball have played the position , including mario mendoza , for whom george brett popularized the eponymous mendoza line to describe a batting average below in practice , a marginal fielder as a shortstop who hits well can be moved to almost any other position , especially second base or third base , whether early in their careers ( examples : george brett and mike schmidt were both tried early in their careers as shortstops ) or later due to diminished fielding range , slower reflexes , weaker throwing arms , increased risk of injury , or co-existence with another dominant shortstop , as with ernie banks , cal ripken jr
