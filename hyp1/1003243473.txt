under the terms of this agreement , protestantism became virtually the state religion of the bohemian lands however , his nearest male relative , wolfgang william , count palatine of neuburg , was a catholic , so , shortly before his death , frederick iv had named another wittelsbach , john ii , count palatine of zweibrücken , as his son 's guardian worst of all for frederick , on 3 july 1620 , the protestant union signed the treaty of ulm ( 1620 ) , thereby withdrawing their support for frederick and declaring neutrality in the conflict between frederick and the catholic league his father , frederick iv , was the ruler of electoral palatinate ; his mother was louise juliana of nassau , the daughter of william i of orange and charlotte of bourbon the palatine simmerns , a cadet branch of the house of wittelsbach , were noted for their attachment to calvinism ; this was in marked contrast to the other main line of wittelsbachs , headed by duke maximilian , which was deeply devoted to the roman catholic church politically , frederick positioned himself as a leader of the protestant princes in the holy roman empire , and as a defender of the liberty of the german nobles against the catholic matthias , holy roman emperor a declaration of the cavses , for the which , wee frederick , by the grace of god king bohemia , covnt palatine of the rhine , elector of the sacred empire , & c frederick did not publicly break with the emperor , but in a letter to his father-in-law , james i of england , he placed the blame for the bohemian vote on the jesuits and the spanish party at the habsburg court image : justus sustermans 028.jpg thumb right ferdinand ii , holy roman emperor ( 1578–1637 ) , who was elected king of bohemia in 1617 and who would later claim that frederick had usurped his rightful claim to the throne of bohemia the capital of the palatinate , heidelberg , was suffering from an outbreak of bubonic plague at this time , so frederick spent his first two years in the upper palatinate before being brought to heidelberg in 1598 image : reichsacht gegen friedrich v.jpg thumb left 150px 1623 edict by ferdinand ii , holy roman emperor ( 1578–1637 ) awarding frederick 's lands and titles to maximilian i , elector of bavaria ( 1573–1651 ) furthermore , the twelve years ' truce , a hiatus in the eighty years ' war , was set to expire in 1621 , and was likely to lead to renewed fighting between the dutch republic and the spanish empire frederick 's propagandists attempted to respond to the phrase by arguing that frederick was in fact a '' winter lion '' who defended the crown of bohemia against troublemakers and liars , and that he would also be a '' summer lion the electoral college also condemned the bohemian confederation 's attempt to remove ferdinand from the throne of bohemia and declared that the 1617 vote of the estates of bohemia , making ferdinand king of bohemia , was binding the nickname '' the winter king '' appeared shortly after the beginning of frederick 's reign and our first printed reference using the term came in a 1619 imperial pamphlet that presented the phrase in the context of a royal chronogram on 26 august 1619 , the states of the bohemian confederacy elected frederick as the new king of bohemia , frederick receiving news of his election on 29 august in amberg from silesia , frederick wanted to plan revenge for the battle of white mountain , but the silesian estates refused to support this project , and he was forced to leave silesia in early 1621 he argued that he had not broken the public peace because bohemia was located outside of the holy roman empire and there was not , therefore , a conflict between an imperial prince and the emperor on 6 february 1621 , representatives of the protestant union met with ferdinand at heilbronn to protest , but they soon agreed to support the settlement in the palatinate , and the palatinate remained occupied by spanish troops edward ( 1625–1663 ) henriette marie ( 1626–1651 ) philip frederick ( 1627–1650 ) charlotte ( 1628–1631 ) sophia ( 1630–1714 ) , heir presumptive to the thrones of england and ireland by the act of settlement , 1701 two of frederick v 's sisters were married to leading protestant princes : his sister luise juliane to his one-time guardian john ii , count palatine of zweibrücken , and his sister elizabeth charlotte to george william , elector of brandenburg in keeping with his father 's policy , frederick v sought a marriage to elizabeth stuart , daughter of james vi of scotland and i of england on 19 september 1610 , frederick 's father , frederick iv , died from '' extravagant living '' ; his son being 14 years old at the time strategists in the palatinate believed that if frederick became king , this would lead john george i , elector of saxony , to break his alliance with the habsburgs and come fully to the protestant cause other possible allies – the dutch republic , charles emmanuel i , duke of savoy , and the republic of venice – sent letters saying they would not be able to offer frederick assistance if he accepted the bohemian offer frederick was very stingy in funding his administration , and yet , in order to maintain the dignity of a royal court , he spent vast sums on building and entertainment , quickly blowing through donations from the english and dutch governments the state 's finances had been disrupted for years , and , at any rate , bohemian kings had only very limited ability to raise funds , being primarily dependent on the goodwill of the nobility and the tax allocations of the diets frederick was born on 26 august 1596 at the ( a hunting lodge ) near amberg in the upper palatinate frederick 's forces under the command of georg friedrich , margrave of baden-durlach were defeated at the battle of wimpfen on 6 may 1622 ; and then forces under christian the younger of brunswick were soundly defeated at the battle of höchst on 20 june 1622 although his successor , the future emperor ferdinand ii , had previously been crowned king of bohemia , the estates of bohemia now refused to recognise him as their king yet in the latter year there was discussion within the protestant union about fielding a protestant candidate to supplant matthias as king of bohemia , and frederick 's name was discussed in this regard in 1613 , matthias , holy roman emperor intervened in the dispute , with the result being that frederick v was able to begin his personal rule in the palatinate even though he was still underage to raise money for the bohemian forces , frederick used his private funds , pawned his jewels and , in may 1620 , drove the palatinate into insolvency when he decided to move two tons of gold to bohemia upon frederick 's pressing his case with gustavus adolphus , gustavus adolphus told frederick that he would accept frederick 's restoration without dutch/british support only if frederick would agree to hold the palatinate as a fief of the king of sweden image : hortus palatinus und heidelberger schloss von jacques fouquiere.jpg thumb left 200px heidelberg castle and the hortus palatinus commissioned by frederick , and designed by english architect inigo jones ( 1573–1652 ) and french engineer salomon de caus ( 1576–1626 ) , painting by jacques fouquier friedrich schiller : geschichte des 30jährigen kriegs , teil 1 more recently , historians have concluded that frederick 's decision was based primarily on a sense of duty to his fellow protestants , although frederick wavered between his obligations to the emperor and his commitment to his religious brethren image : chronogramm winterkönig c-l 032.jpg thumb left 200px this 1619 imperial pamphlet , containing a chronogram , was the first to dub frederick '' the winter king '' however , gustavus adolphus was not prepared to offer frederick support for restoring him in the palatinate because england and the netherlands had not signed off on such a proposal frederick was related to almost all of the ruling families of the holy roman empire and a number of diplomats and dignitaries attended his baptism at amberg on 6 october 1596 this event – known as the second defenestration of prague – marked the beginning of the bohemian revolt , and with it , the beginning of the thirty years ' war one of frederick 's first acts upon taking the reins of government was attendance at a meeting of the protestant union , during which he was struck by fever and nearly died frederick was willing to compromise with the emperor , but he wanted the restoration of his lands and electoral title , and the emperor was not inclined to restore these to frederick as such , on 9 november , frederick fled to the silesian capital of wrocław , along with his wife and child , some advisers , and not much more baggage than the bohemian crown jewels elaborate celebrations , organised by francis bacon , followed the ceremony ; these included a performance of the masque of the inner temple and gray 's inn by francis beaumont and the memorable masque of the middle temple and lincoln 's inn by george chapman as son and heir of frederick iv , elector palatine ( 1574–1610 ) , frederick was the hereditary ruler of the palatinate concerning anhalt 's political aims and his secret diplomacy against the house of habsburg see : walter krüssmann , ernst von mansfeld ( 1580–1626 ) ;

even the protestant prince-electors john george i of saxony and john sigismund of brandenburg adhered to the tradition of supporting the habsburg imperial candidate the emperor was also able to obtain the support of elector john george i of saxony ; john george 's court preacher , matthias hoe von hoenegg , encouraged the emperor to smash frederick and the bohemians the protestants claimed the status of these lands fell under the term '' royal land '' , and thus were subject to bohemia 's authority by the letter of majesty – a very disputed legal interpretation which the habsburg government rejected in march 1631 , frederick despatched diplomat sir robert anstruther to hold discussions with ernst egon viii , count of fürstenberg , president of the imperial privy council , about restoring frederick 's lands , but frederick died before these could bear any fruit the dutch republic and frederick signed a contract in which he accepted the support of the netherlands for the reconquest of his dominions in these circumstances christian i , prince of anhalt-bernburg , frederick v 's governor of the upper palatinate , moved to intervene in bohemia in 1617 , matthias prevailed on the bohemian estates to elect the habsburg ferdinand , duke of styria , as heir to the throne of bohemia at the diet of regensburg ( 1630 ) , frederick formally petitioned to be forgiven for having accepted the crown of bohemia and admitted his wrongdoing
