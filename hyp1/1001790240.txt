the mildest case , not quite a cover-up , is simply to release news which could be embarrassing but is not important enough to guarantee attention , at a time when other news is dominating the headlines , or immediately before a holiday or weekend once some hint of the hidden matter starts to become known , the cover-up gradually draws all the top leadership , at least , of an organization into complicity in covering up a misdeed or even crime that may have originally been committed by a few of its members acting independently the original misdeed being covered may be relatively minor , such as the '' third-rate burglary '' which started the watergate scandal , but the cover-up adds so many additional crimes ( obstruction of justice , perjury , payoffs and bribes , in some cases suspicious suicides or outright murder ) that the cover-up becomes much more serious than the original crime this '' passive cover-up '' is often justified by the motive of not wanting to embarrass the culprit or expose them to criminal prosecution or even the belief that the cover-up is justified by protecting the greater community from scandal yet , because of the passive cover-up , the misdeed often goes undiscovered and results in harm to others ensuing from its failure to be discovered real cover-ups are common enough , but any event which is not completely clear is likely to give rise to a thicket of conspiracy theories alleging covering up of sometimes the weirdest and most unlikely conspiracies '' snowjob '' is an american and canadian colloquialism for a deception or a cover-up ; for example , helen gahagan douglas described the nixon administration as '' the greatest snow job in history '' ; initial response to allegation flat denial convince the media to bury the story preemptively distribute false information claim that the '' problem '' is minimal gaslighting claim the accusations are half-truths claim the critic has no proof attack the critic 's motive ad hominem ; withhold or tamper with evidence prevent the discovery of evidence destroy or alter the evidence make discovery of evidence difficult create misleading names of individuals and companies to hide funding lie or commit perjury block or delay investigations issue restraining orders claim executive privilege ; delayed response to allegation deny a restricted definition of wrongdoing ( e.g , confess to minor charges ) use biased evidence as a defense claim that the critic 's evidence is biased select a biased blue ribbon commission or '' independent '' inquiry ; intimidate participants , witnesses or whistleblowers see also list of whistleblowers blackmail : hire private investigators and threaten to reveal past wrongdoing ( '' dirt '' ) death threats of the critic or his or her family threaten the critic with loss of job or future employment in industry transfer the critic to an inferior job or location intimidate the critic with lawsuits or slapp suits murder ; assassination ; publicity management bribe the press astroturfing retaliate against hostile media threaten the press with loss of access attack the motives of the press place defensive advertisements buy out the news source ; damage control claim no knowledge of wrongdoing scapegoats : blame an underling for unauthorized action fire the person ( s ) in charge ; win court cases hire the best lawyers hire scientists and expert witnesses who will support your story delay with legal maneuvers influence or control the judges ; reward cover-up participants hush money little or no punishment pardon or commute sentences promote employees as a reward for cover-up reemploy the employee after dust clears
