: the phrase '' gut feeling '' may also be used as a shorthand term for an individual 's '' common sense '' perception of what is considered '' the right thing to do '' , such as helping an injured passerby , avoiding dark alleys and generally acting in accordance with instinctive feelings about a given situation it can also refer to simple common knowledge phrases which are true no matter when said , such as '' water is wet '' or '' fire is hot '' , or to ideas that an individual intuitively regards as true ( see '' truthiness '' for examples ) details and information about the past is used to make decisions , as past experiences of feelings tend to influence current decision-making , how people will feel in the future , and if they want to feel that way again the '' psychophysiology flow '' , as ikemi points out , ikemi , akira ( 2005 ) , carl rogers and eugene gendlin on the bodily felt sense : what they share and where they differ , in : person-centered and experiential psychotherapies , vol 4 , n since an individual does not know the background or the ending of a story they are constantly replaying an event in their mind which is causing them to have mixed feelings of happiness , sadness , excitement , and et cetera if there is any difference between feelings and emotions , the feeling of uncertainty is less sure than the emotion of ambivalence : the former is precarious , the latter is not yet acted upon or decided upon when one is in a good state of feeling , they never want it to end ; conversely , when someone is in a bad state , they want that feeling to disappear these individuals cut , stab , and starve themselves in an effort to feel something other than what they currently feel , as they believe the pain to be not as bad as their actual problem 1 is a concept created by carl rogers , founder of the humanistic psychology school , to describe the 'sensory and visceral experiences ' , or the flow of internal sensations that the individual can perceive the neurologist robert burton , writes in his book on being certain , that feelings of certainty may stem from involuntary mental sensations , much like emotions or perceptual recognition ( another example might be the tip of the tongue phenomenon ) indulging in what one might have thought would 've made them happy or excited might only cause a temporary thrill , or it might result in the opposite of what was expected and wanted individuals in society want to know every detail about something in hopes to maximize the feeling for that moment , but wilson found that feeling uncertain can lead to something being more enjoyable because it has a sense of mystery social and other factors do not influence how the emotion is perceived , so these factors have no control on how or if the emotion is suppressed or expressed results showed that those who had purchased flowers in the past for themselves felt happier and that feeling lasted longer for them than for a person who had never experienced purchasing flowers for themselves it may be negative , such as a feeling of uneasiness , or positive , such as a feeling of trust gilbert and wilson conducted a study to show how pleased a person would feel if they purchased flowers for themselves for no specific reason ( birthday , anniversary , or promotion etc
