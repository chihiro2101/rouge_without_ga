image : natural & impervious cover diagrams epa.jpg thumb 400px relationship between impervious surfaces and surface runoff with less vegetation and more impervious surfaces ( parking lots , roads , buildings , compacted soil ) , developed areas allow less rain to infiltrate into the ground , and more runoff is generated than in the undeveloped condition because the water is flushed out of the watershed during the storm event , little infiltrates the soil , replenishes groundwater , or supplies stream baseflow in dry weather in addition to the pollutants carried in surface runoff , urban runoff is being recognized as a cause of pollution in its own right stormwater runoff from roadways has been observed to contain many metals including zinc ( zn ) , cadmium ( cd ) , copper ( cu ) , nickel ( ni ) , lead ( pb ) , chromium ( cr ) , manganese ( mn ) , iron ( fe ) , vanadium ( v ) , cobalt ( co ) , and aluminum ( al ) ( sansalone and buchberger , 1997 ; westerlund and viklander , 2006 ) and other constituents in some areas , especially along the u.s for example , about 75 percent of the toxic chemicals getting to seattle , washington 's puget sound are carried by stormwater that runs off paved roads and driveways , rooftops , yards , and other developed land environmental protection agency reports “ the contaminants that have been observed above drinking water standards or health advisory limits in storm water drainage well injectate are aluminum , antimony , arsenic , beryllium , cadmium , chloride , chromium , color , copper , cyanide , iron , lead , manganese , mercury , nickel , nitrate , ph , selenium , tds , turbidity , zinc , benzene , benzo ( a ) pyrene , bis ( 2-ethylhexyl ) phtlalate , chlordane , dichloromethane , fecal coliforms , methyl-tertbutyl- ether , pentachlorophenol , tetrachloroethylene , and trichloroethylene highway-runoff contaminants of particular interest throughout the united states include deicers , nutrients , metals , industrial/urban-organic chemicals , sediment , and agricultural chemicals from industrial , commercial , residential , agricultural , and highway sources ” in addition to the problem of chemical contaminants in stormwater , this usgs report also identifies problems of physical habitat disturbance that best management practices ( bmps ) do not eliminate , “ some of the most substantial biological changes caused by development are directly or indirectly related to altered hydrology despite efforts to use bmps to attenuate the hydrologic effects of development , increased peak flows and more flashy runoff will cause physical modifications to the channel shape , bed substrate , and banks of receiving waters , with corresponding effects on aquatic habitat and biota loss of forest canopy , increases in paved area , and shallow and ( or ) muddy detention areas also may cause thermal pollution problems , which can exacerbate chemical stressors on aquatic organisms in receiving waters urban flooding is the inundation of land or property in a built-up environment caused by stormwater overwhelming the capacity of drainage , such as storm sewers although triggered by single events such as flash flooding or snow melt , urban flooding is a condition , characterized by its repetitive , costly and systemic impacts on communities although the number of casualties from urban flooding is usually limited , the economic , social and environmental consequences can be considerable : in addition to direct damage to property and infrastructure ( highways , utilities and services ) , chronically wet houses are linked to an increase in respiratory problems and other illnesses indoor air quality ( iaq ) scientific findings resource bank ( iaq-sfrb ) , '' health risks or dampness or mold in houses '' sewer backups are often from the sanitary sewer system , which takes on some storm water as a result of infiltration/inflow in urban areas with natural subsurface ( karst ) drainage there are no surface streams for the increased stormwater from impervious surfaces such as roofs , parking lots , and streets to runoff into control of flooding and erosion ; control of hazardous materials to prevent release of pollutants into the environment ( source control ) ; planning and construction of stormwater systems so contaminants are removed before they pollute surface waters or groundwater resources ; acquisition and protection of natural waterways or rehabilitation ; building nature-based solutions such as ponds , swales , constructed wetlands or green infrastructure solutions to work with existing or '' hard '' drainage structures , such as pipes and concrete channels ( constructed wetlands built for stormwater treatment can also serve as habitat for plants , amphibians and fish ) development of funding approaches to stormwater programs potentially including stormwater fee and the creation of a stormwater utility ; development of long-term asset management programs to repair and replace aging infrastructure ; revision of current stormwater regulations to address comprehensive stormwater needs ; enhancement and enforcement of existing ordinances to make sure property owners consider the effects of stormwater before , during and after development of their land ; education of a community about how its actions affect water quality , and about what it can do to improve water quality image:7sigma raingarden 66.jpg thumb rain garden designed to treat stormwater from adjacent parking lot integrated water management ( iwm ) of stormwater has the potential to address many of the issues affecting the health of waterways and water supply challenges facing the modern urban city professionals in their respective fields , such as urban planners , architects , landscape architects , interior designers , and engineers , often consider integrated water management as a foundation of the design process also known as low impact development ( lid ) in the united states , or water sensitive urban design ( wsud ) in australia , iwm has the potential to improve runoff quality , reduce the risk and impact of flooding and deliver an additional water resource to augment potable supply the development of the modern city often results in increased demands for water supply due to population growth , while at the same time altered runoff predicted by climate change has the potential to increase the volume of stormwater that can contribute to drainage and flooding problems iwm offers several techniques , including stormwater harvest ( to reduce the amount of water that can cause flooding ) , infiltration ( to restore the natural recharge of groundwater ) , biofiltration or bioretention ( e.g , rain gardens ) , to store and treat runoff and release it at a controlled rate to reduce impact on streams and wetland treatments ( to store and control runoff rates and provide habitat in urban areas ) the most popular is to incorporate land-based solutions to reduce stormwater runoff through the use of retention ponds , bioswales , infiltration trenches , sustainable pavements ( such as permeable paving ) , and others noted above lid can also be achieved by utilizing engineered , manufactured products to achieve similar , or potentially better , results as land-based systems ( underground storage tanks , stormwater treatment systems , biofilters , etc the proper lid solution is one that balances the desired results ( controlling runoff and pollution ) with the associated costs ( loss of usable land for land-based systems versus capital cost of manufactured solution ) iwm as a movement can be regarded as being in its infancy and brings together elements of drainage science , ecology and a realization that traditional drainage solutions transfer problems further downstream to the detriment of the environment and water resources much of this impairment is due to polluted runoff , generally in urbanized watersheds ( in other us watersheds , agricultural pollution is a major source ) to address the nationwide problem of stormwater pollution , congress broadened the cwa definition of '' point source '' in 1987 to include industrial stormwater discharges and municipal separate storm sewer systems ( '' ms4 '' ) one example of a local educational program is that of the west michigan environmental action council ( wmeac ) , which has coined the term hydrofilth to describe stormwater pollution , west michigan environmental action council ( wmeac ) , grand rapids , mi
