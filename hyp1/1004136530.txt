the codification of christianity as the legal religion of norway was attributed to olaf , and his legal arrangements for the church of norway came to stand so high in the norwegian people 's and clergy 's eyes that when pope gregory vii attempted to make clerical celibacy binding on the priests of western europe in 1074–75 , norwegians largely ignored it , since there was no mention of clerical celibacy in olaf 's legal code for their church what seems clear is that olaf made efforts to establish a church organization on a broader scale than before , among other things by importing bishops from england , normandy and germany , and that he tried to enforce christianity in the inland areas , which had the least communication with the rest of europe , and which economically were more strongly based on agriculture , so that the inclination to hold on to the former fertility cult was stronger than in the more diversified and expansive western parts of norway for various reasons , most importantly the death of king cnut the great in 1035 but perhaps also a certain discontent among norwegian nobles with danish rule in the years after olaf 's death in 1030 , olaf 's illegitimate son with the concubine alvhild , magnus the good , assumed power in norway , and eventually also in denmark olave 's church south of london bridge gave its name to tooley street and to the st olave 's poor law union , later the metropolitan borough of bermondsey : its workhouse in rotherhithe became st olave 's hospital and then an old people 's home a few hundred metres from st olav 's church , which is the norwegian church in london only after norway was made a metropolitan province with its own archbishop in 1153—making the norwegian church , on the one hand , more independent of its king , but on the other hand , more directly responsible to the pope—did canon law gain a greater prominence in the life and jurisdiction of the norwegian church olaf catholic church , minneapolis , minnesota the son of åsta gudbrandsdatter and harald grenske , a petty king in vestfold , whom later icelandic sagas would describe as a great-great-grandchild of harald fairhair , norway 's first king judging from the bare outlines of known historical facts , he appears to have been a fairly unsuccessful ruler , whose power was based on an alliance with the much more powerful king cnut the great ; who was driven into exile when he claimed power of his own ; and whose attempt at a reconquest was swiftly crushed olaf seized the opportunity to win back the kingdom , but he fell in 1030 at the battle of stiklestad , where some of his own subjects from central norway took arms against him owing to olaf 's later status as norway 's patron saint , and to his importance in later medieval historiography and in norwegian folklore , it is difficult to assess the historical olaf 's character he was probably the only one of the missionary bishops left in the country at the time of olaf 's death , and he stood behind the translation and beatification of olaf on 3 august 1031 saint olaf catholic church in downtown minneapolis church website ; statue of the saint from the sanctuary saint olaf catholic church in norge , virginia saint olaf catholic church and school in bountiful , ut st king cnut , though distracted by the task of governing england , ruled norway for five years after stiklestad , with his son svein and svein 's mother ælfgifu ( known as álfífa in old norse sources ) as regents like freyr , he became associated with fertility , which led to his adoption as a patron saint by farmers , fishermen , sailors and merchants of the hanseatic league , who turned to him for good yield and protection olaf himself is portrayed in later sources as a saintly miracle-working figure to help support this quick view of conversion for norway , but the historical olaf did not act this way , as seen especially in the skaldic verses attributed to him in 1026 he lost the battle of the helgeå , and in 1029 the norwegian nobles , seething with discontent , supported the invasion of king cnut the great of denmark in his book the conversion of scandinavia , anders winroth argues that there was a '' long process of assimilation , in which the scandinavians adopted , one by one and over time , individual christian practices but large stone crosses and other christian symbols suggest that at least norway 's coastal areas were deeply influenced by christianity long before olaf 's time ; with one exception , all of norway 's rulers since håkon the good ( c the main route , approximately 640 & nbsp ; km long , starts in the ancient part of oslo and heads north , along lake mjosa , up the gudbrandsdal valley , over dovrefjell and down the orkdal valley , ending at nidaros cathedral in trondheim olaf was also , together with the virgin mary , the patron saint of the chapel of the varangians , the scandinavian warriors who served as the bodyguard of the byzantine emperor three factors are important : the later myth surrounding his role in the christianisation of norway , the various dynastic relationships among the ruling families , and the need for legitimisation in a later period at this time , local bishops and their people recognised and proclaimed a person a saint , and a formal canonisation procedure through the papal curia was not customary ; in olaf 's case , this did not happen until 1888 in norway today , he is commonly called olav den hellige ( bokmål ; olaf the holy ) or heilage-olav ( nynorsk ; the holy olaf ) in honour of his sainthood olav , the only remaining tower of vyborg castle the coat of arms of the church of norway contains two axes , the instruments of st olaf returned to norway in 1015 and declared himself king , obtaining the support of the five petty kings of the uplands , norway st olave 's church , york , is referred to in the anglo-saxon chronicle for 1055 as the place of burial of its founder , earl siward olave 's anglican church , toronto , on , canada the primary school and gaa club in balally , dublin , ireland , both named for st numerous danish churches were dedicated to olaf during his reign , and the sagas give glimpses of the young king 's efforts to promote the cult of his deceased father the passio olavi , the official record of olaf 's miracles , contains an episode where olaf helps a man escape from the hulder , the '' hidden people '' of norwegian folklore a pilgrim 's office in oslo gives advice to pilgrims , and a pilgrim centre in trondheim , under the aegis of the cathedral , awards certificates to pilgrims when they complete their journeys in pagan times , scandinavian kings derived their right to rule from their claims of descent from the norse god odin , or in the case of the kings of the swedes at old uppsala , from freyr in 1016 at the battle of nesjar he defeated earl sweyn , one of the earls of lade and hitherto the de facto ruler of norway olaf annihilated the petty kings of the south , subdued the aristocracy , asserted his suzerainty in the orkney islands , and conducted a successful raid on denmark but their regency was unpopular , and when olaf 's illegitimate son magnus ( 'the good ' ) laid claim to the norwegian throne , svein and ælfgifu were forced to flee it also led to the naming of st olave 's grammar school , which was established in 1571 and was in tooley street until 1968 , when it moved to orpington , kent olav 's cathedral , oslo , the main cathedral of the roman catholic church in norway st olaf swiftly became norway 's patron saint ; bishop grimkell performed his canonisation only a year after his death olav was founded in 1847 by oscar i , king of norway and sweden , in memory of the king the exact position of saint olaf 's grave in nidaros has been unknown since 1568 , due to the effects of the lutheran iconoclasm in 1536–37 erik and the kings of denmark the cult of saint canute , just as in england the norman and plantagenet kings promoted the cult of st the osilians , taken by surprise , had at first agreed to olaf 's demands , but then gathered an army during the negotiations and attacked the norwegians although its facts are dubious , the saga recounts olaf 's deeds as follows : about 1008 , olaf landed on the estonian island of saaremaa ( osilia ) olaf has traditionally been seen as leading the christianisation of norway , but most scholars of the period now believe that olaf had little to do with the process serpent image another took place on the day of his death , when a blind man regained his sight after rubbing his eyes with hands stained with olaf 's blood
