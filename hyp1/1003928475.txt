the starter must be fed 4 to 12 hours prior to being added to dough , by mixing flour and water to the starter due to the length of time sourdough bread takes to proof , many bakers may refrigerate their loaves prior to baking because the rise time of most sourdough starters is longer than that of breads made with baker 's yeasts , sourdough starters are generally unsuitable for use in a bread machine however , sourdough that has been proved over many hours , using a sourdough starter or mother dough , can then be transferred to the machine , utilizing only the baking segment of the bread-making program , bypassing timed mechanical kneading by the machine 's paddle this may be convenient for single loaf production , but the complex blistered and slashed crust characteristics of oven-baked sourdough bread can not be achieved in a bread making machine , as this usually requires the use of a baking stone in the oven and misting of the dough to produce steam sourdough is a stable culture of lactic acid bacteria and yeast in a mixture of flour and water broadly speaking , the yeast produces gas ( carbon dioxide ) which leavens the dough , and the lactic acid bacteria produce lactic acid , which contributes flavor in the form of sourness during sourdough fermentation , many cereal enzymes , particularly phytases , proteases and pentosanases , are activated through acidification and contribute to biochemical changes during sourdough fermentation major lactic acid bacteria in sourdough are heterofermentative organisms and convert hexoses by the phosphoketolase pathway to lactate , co 2 and acetate or ethanol ; heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria are usually associated with homofermentative lactobacilli , particularly lactobacillus and companilactobacillus species traditional sourdoughs used as sole leavening agent are referred to as type i sourdough , examples include sourdoughs used for san francisco sourdough bread , panettone , and rye bread type i sourdoughs are generally firm doughs , have a ph range of 3.8 to 4.5 , and are fermented in a temperature range of '' the terms '' fructosan , glucofructan , sucrosyl fructan , polyfructan , and polyfructosan '' are all used to describe a class of compounds that are '' structurally and metabolically '' related to sucrose , where '' carbon is stored as sucrose and polymers of fructose ( fructans ) they have a ph less than 3.5 , and are fermented within a temperature range of for several days without feedings , which reduces the flora 's activity type iii sourdoughs are type ii sourdoughs subjected to a drying process , usually either spray or drum drying , and are mainly used at an industrial level as flavoring agents '' the drying conditions , time and heat applied , may be varied in order to influence caramelize and produce desired characteristics in the baked product there are many breads that use techniques similar to that used in the making of sourdough bread sourdough fermentation and lactic acid bacteria may be useful to improve the quality of gluten-free breads , such as by enhancing texture , aroma , and shelf life , which can be extended by inhibition of mycotoxins associated with fungus sourdough fermentation also reduces fermentable oligosaccharides , disaccharides , monosaccharides , and polyols ( fodmaps ) as well as the amylase trypsin inhibitor ( ati ) , wheat components that are thought to contribute to non-celiac wheat sensitivity and irritable bowel syndrome , and increases the concentration or bio-availability of bioactive compounds , particularly phenolic compounds
