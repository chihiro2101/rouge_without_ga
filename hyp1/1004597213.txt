he claimed that only the nazi civilian administration ( not the wehrmacht ) was responsible for atrocities against soviet civilians and scapegoated hitler and the russian winter for the wehrmacht 's military reverses , as he later did in panzer leader ; in addition , he wrote that six million germans died during their expulsion from the eastern territories by the soviet union and its allies , guderian , heinz guderian was a capable tactician and technician , leading his troops successfully in the invasion of poland , the battle of france and during the early stages of the invasion of the soviet union , especially in the advance to smolensk and the battle of kiev 1 pow camp in grizedale hall in the north of england from 9 august 1945 as a political intelligence department lecturer taking part in the re-education programme , in an effort to use that to re-establish his reputation as a military theorist and commentator , asked guderian to say that he had based his military theories on liddell hart 's ; guderian obliged he was assigned to serve on the staff of the central command of the eastern frontier guard service which was intended to control and coordinate the independent freikorps units in the defense of germany 's eastern frontiers against polish and soviet forces engaged in the russian civil war in 1927 , guderian was promoted to major and in october he was posted to the transport section of the truppenamt , a clandestine form of the army 's general staff , which had been forbidden by the treaty of versailles in 1950 , guderian published a pamphlet entitled can europe be defended ? , where he lamented that the western powers had picked the wrong side to ally themselves with during the war , even as germany '' was fighting for its naked existence '' , as a '' defender of europe '' against the supposed bolshevik menace following the conclusion of the battle of smolensk , which ended with the encirclement and destruction of the soviet 16th , 19th and 20th armies , general franz halder , chief-of-staff of the okh , argued in favor of the all-out drive toward moscow james corum writes in his book the roots of blitzkrieg : hans von seeckt and german military reform that guderian was an excellent general , a first-rate tactician and a man who played a central role in developing panzer divisions , irrespective of his memoirs however , general joachim lemelsen , a corps commander within guderian 's panzer group , is documented as saying '' prisoners , who could be shown to have been commissars , had to be immediately taken aside and shot '' and that the order came directly from guderian on 1 march 1943 , after the german defeat in the battle of stalingrad , hitler appointed guderian to the newly created position of inspector general of armoured troops battistelli writes that guderian rewrote history in his memoirs , but notes that the biggest re-writing of history comes not in his putative fathering of the panzer force but in the cover-up of his culpability for war crimes during operation barbarossa like other generals , guderian 's memoirs emphasized his loyalty to germany and the german people ; however , he neglected to mention that hitler bought this loyalty with bribes , including landed estates and a monthly payment of 2,000 reichsmarks the court discharged those found guilty of participating in the plot from the armed forces so that they could be tried by the people 's court , set up for the purpose of prosecuting the alleged plotters in the aftermath of the german failure , guderian refused to pass on hitler 's 'stand fast ' order and fell out with kluge , the new commander of the army group centre by november , the attack by the 2nd panzer group on tula and kashira , south of moscow , achieved limited success , while guderian vacillated between despair and optimism , depending on the situation at the front in guderian 's 1937 book achtung â€” panzer ! he wrote that '' the time has passed when the russians had no instinct for technology '' and that germany would have to reckon '' with the eastern question in a form more serious than ever before in history '' davies , in their book the myth of the eastern front , conclude that guderian 's memoirs are full of '' egregious untruths , half truths , and omissions '' , as well as outright '' nonsense '' as late as 2002 , for the 55th anniversary of the first publication of the book , the new york times , newsweek , the new yorker and other outlets published positive reviews , reinforcing the tenets of the myth of the clean wehrmacht guderian became the acting chief of the general staff of the army high command with the responsibility of advising hitler on the eastern front in the 1930s guderian played a significant role in the development of both the panzer division concept and a doctrine of mechanized offensive warfare that would later become known as blitzkrieg with resolute support for the regime , the generals unquestioningly waged one war of aggression after the other , and , once barbarossa began , willingly partook in the genocide of the nazi regime '' as chief-of-staff of the okh , guderian did not object to the orders that hitler and himmler issued during the brutal suppression of the warsaw uprising nor the atrocities being perpetrated against the civilian population of the city foremost in his mind was the '' liberation '' of his former family estate at gross-klonia ; guderian ordered the advance on gross-klonia at night and through fog , leading to what he subsequently admitted were '' serious casualties '' in his book operation barbarossa and germany 's defeat in the east , stahel wrote : '' the men in control of hitler 's armies were not honourable men , carrying out their orders as dutiful servants of the state guderian demanded an inquiry into the realities of tank warfare on the eastern front , eventually suggesting in november to senior german tank designers and manufacturers that the quickest solution was to produce a direct copy of the soviet t-34 tank the latter months of 1944 were marked by the ever-increasing strife between the okh and the okw ( oberkommando der wehrmacht ) as the two organizations competed for resources , especially in the run-up to the last-ditch battle of the bulge hitler placed guderian in charge of the '' honour court '' ; a kangaroo court for those accused of involvement in the 20 july plot the favourable descriptions started with the british journalist and military theorist liddell hart , who described guderian as one of the '' great captains of history '' , in a book published by the mass-market ballantine books in 1957 a british counter-attack at arras on 21 may slowed down the german advance and allowed bef to establish defenses around points of evacuation , while hitler , conscious of potential reverses and of allowing unsupported armor into urban fighting , issued the order to halt he cast himself as an innovator and the '' father '' of the german panzer arm , both before the war and during the blitzkrieg years how will the army be supplied with fuel , spares and replacement vehicles ? and how to move large mechanized forces , especially those that are road-bound ? he answered his own questions in discussions of three broad areas : refueling ; spares parts ; and access to roads however , during the planning for operation barbarossa , the german invasion of the soviet union , he had become optimistic about the supposed superiority of german arms in reality , guderian had applied himself to the task with vigour of a nazi adherent , which perhaps was due to the desire to deflect attention from himself guderian claimed , contrary to historical evidence , that the criminal commissar order was not carried out by his troops because it '' never reached his panzer group '' the plan established a force for the penetration of the forest that comprised the largest concentration of german armor to that date ; 1,112 out of germany 's total of 2,438 tanks after the war , guderian claimed that his actions in the final months as head of the okh were driven by a search for a solution to germany 's increasingly bleak prospects owing to the 2nd panzer group 's southward turn during the battle , the wehrmacht destroyed the entire southwestern front east of kiev , inflicting over 600,000 losses on the red army by 26 september on 6 march 1945 , shortly before the end of the war , guderian participated in a propaganda broadcast that denied the holocaust ; the red army in its advance had just liberated several extermination camps guderian himself denied any involvement with the plot ; nevertheless , he had unexpectedly retired to his estate on the day of the assassination attempt while the topics covered were mundane , guderian related them to why germany had lost world war i , a controversial subject at the time , and thus raised his profile in the military despite the success of the invasion , french defeat was not inevitable ; the french had better , more numerous military equipment and were not overwhelmed by a numerically or technologically superior military force hitler and his generals became over-confident after their historic victory , and came to believe they could defeat the soviet union , a country with significantly more natural resources , manpower and industrial capacity in a conversation with hitler prior to the offensive , guderian said : '' why are we attacking in the east at all this year ? '' hitler responded , '' you are right as head of the okh , guderian was faced with the pressing issues of the staff work being impacted by arrests , which among the okh staff and their families eventually ran into the hundreds after the war , guderian blamed hitler for frittering away the last german reserves in the operation ; nonetheless , germany 's strategic situation was such that even twenty or thirty extra divisions would not have helped in the aftermath of the battle , guderian blamed slow commitment of 4th army to the attack for the german failure to reach moscow operation citadel , the last major german offensive operation in the east , was an attempt by the german army to regain the initiative adhering to the post-war myths , the profile posited that a commander like this could '' function in any political climate and be unaffected by it '' guderian 's panzer group led the '' race to the sea '' , ending with the british expeditionary force ( bef ) and french forces trapped at dunkirk it also failed to appreciate the reality that moscow was a metropolis that german forces lacked the numbers to either encircle or to capture in a frontal assault he replaced general of the infantry kurt zeitzler , who had abandoned the position on 1 july after losing faith in hitler 's judgement and suffering a nervous breakdown guderian reviews the development of armoured forces in the european nations and soviet russia , and describes what he felt was essential for the effective use of armoured forces
