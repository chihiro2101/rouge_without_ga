this is energy intensive and is further complicated by the tendency of styrene to undergo thermally induced polymerisation into polystyrene , requiring the continuous addition of polymerization inhibitor to the system a laboratory synthesis of styrene entails the decarboxylation of cinnamic acid : : c 6 h 5 ch chco 2 h → c 6 h 5 ch ch 2 + co 2 styrene was first prepared by this method '' ( one knows that styrene when heated in a sealed vessel at 200 & nbsp ; °c , for several hours , is changed into a resinous polymer ( metastyrol ) , and that this polymer , when distilled abruptly , reproduces styrene they concluded , '' the findings have to be interpreted with caution , due to the company based exposure assessment , but the possible association between exposures in the reinforced plastics industry , mainly styrene , and degenerative disorders of the nervous system and pancreatic cancer , deserves attention '' it is reported that an approximately 9:1 mixture of styrene and ethylbenzene is obtained , with a total styrene yield of over 60 % the process attempts to overcome previous shortcomings in earlier attempts to develop production of styrene from ethane and benzene , such as inefficient recovery of aromatics , production of high levels of heavies and tars , and inefficient separation of hydrogen and ethane as the difference in boiling points between the two compounds is only 9 & nbsp ; °c at ambient pressure this necessitates the use of a series of distillation columns claims to have developed this process with commercially viable selectivities , at 400–425 & nbsp ; °c and atmospheric pressure , by forcing these components through a proprietary zeolitic catalyst ethylbenzene is produced via a friedel–crafts reaction between benzene and ethylene ; originally this used aluminum chloride as a catalyst , but in modern production this has been replaced by zeolites an example is the 2019 explosion of the tanker stolt groenland ; in this incident 5,250 metric tons of styrene monomer detonated while the ship was docked in ulsan , republic of korea styrene is regarded as a '' known carcinogen '' , especially in case of eye contact , but also in case of skin contact , of ingestion and of inhalation , according to several sources ethane , along with ethylbenzene , is fed to a dehydrogenation reactor with a catalyst capable of simultaneously producing styrene and ethylene for further details about 19th century polarimeters , see : ) eventually , in 1876 , the dutch chemist van 't hoff resolved the ambiguity : the optical activity of the styrene that was obtained by distilling storax resin was due to a contaminant note that blyth and hofmann state the empirical formula of styrene as c 16 h 8 because at that time , some chemists used the wrong atomic mass for carbon ( 6 instead of 12 ) environmental protection agency ( epa ) has described styrene to be '' a suspected toxin to the gastrointestinal tract , kidney , and respiratory system , among others '' the neurotoxic properties of styrene have also been studied and reported effects include effects on vision ( although unable to reproduce in a subsequent study ) and on hearing functions the vast majority of styrene is produced from ethylbenzene , and almost all ethylbenzene produced worldwide is intended for styrene production despite this claim , work has been done by danish researchers to investigate the relationship between occupational exposure to styrene and cancer around 80 % of styrene is produced by the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene , epidemiologic studies of styrene and cancer : a review of the literature , j ( 1866 ) '' sur les caractères de la benzine et du styrolène , comparés avec ceux des autres carbures d'hydrogène '' ( on the characters of benzene and styrene , compared with those of other hydrocarbons ) , bulletin de la société chimique de paris , 2nd series , 6 : 289–298
