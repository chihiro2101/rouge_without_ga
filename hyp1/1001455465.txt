romans also imported ferrets for rabbit hunting , and the romans then distributed rabbits and the habit of rabbit keeping to the rest of italy , to france , and then across the roman empire , including the british isles in the british isles , these preserves were known as warrens or , and rabbits were known as , to differentiate them from the similar hare a warrener was responsible for controlling poachers and other predators and would collect the rabbits with snares , nets , hounds ( such as greyhounds ) , or by hunting with ferrets some of these strains remain as regional breeds , such as the gotland of sweden , while others , such as the land kaninchen , a spotted rabbit of germany , have become extinct the development of the refrigerated shipping vessels led to the eventual collapse of the european meat rabbit trade , as the over-populated feral rabbits in australia could now be harvested and sold from the santa duromo mountains of brazil comes the rustico , which is known in the united states as the brazilian rabbit with the rise of scientific animal breeding in the late 1700s , led by robert bakewell ( among others ) , distinct livestock breeds were developed for specific purposes image : farmrabbits.jpg thumb right meat-type rabbits were raised for supplementary food in the great depression of the 1930s. 350px science played another role in rabbit raising , this time with rabbits themselves as the tools used for scientific advancement beginning with louis pasteur 's experiments in rabies in the later half of the nineteenth century , rabbits have been used as models to investigate various medical and biological problems , including the transmission of disease and protective antiserum while early rabbit keepers were limited to local and seasonal foodstuffs , which did not permit the maximization of production , health or growth , by 1930 researchers were conducting experiments in rabbit nutrition , similar to the experiments that had isolated vitamins and other nutritional components gradual refinement of diets has resulted in the widespread availability of pelleted feeds , which increase yield , reduce waste , and promote rabbit health , particularly maternal breeding health the final leg of rabbit breeding & mdash ; beyond meat , wool , fur , and laboratory use & mdash ; was the breeding of 'fancy ' animals as pets and curiosities such organizations and associations were also established across europe & mdash ; most notably in germany , france , and scandinavia & mdash ; allowing for the recognition of local breeds ( many of which shared similar characteristics across national borders ) and for the preservation of stock during disruptions such as world wari and world warii closely overlapping with breeding for exhibition and for fur has been the breeding of rabbits for the pet trade while rabbits have been kept as companions for centuries , the sale of rabbits as pets began to rise in the last half of the twentieth century several breeds of rabbit & mdash ; such as the holland lop , the polish , the netherland dwarf , and the lionhead & mdash ; have been specifically bred for the pet trade traits common to many popular pet breeds are small size , '' dwarf '' ( or neotenic ) features , plush or fuzzy coats , and an array of coat colors and patterns outside of the exhibition circles , rabbit raising remained a small-scale but persistent household and farm endeavor , in many locations unregulated by the rules that governed the production of larger livestock eventually , farmers across europe and in the united states began to approach cuniculture with the same scientific principles as had already been applied to the production of grains , poultry , and hoofed livestock the addition of rabbits to the watchlist of endangered heritage breeds that is kept by the livestock conservancy has also led to increased interest from livestock conservationists the world rabbit science association ( wrsa ) , formed in 1976 , was established '' to facilitate in all possible ways the exchange of knowledge and experience among persons in all parts of the world who are contributing to the advancement of the various branches of the rabbit industry '' meanwhile , various rescue groups under the house rabbit society umbrella have taken an increasingly strident stance against any breeding of rabbits ( even as food in developing countries ) on the grounds that it contributes to the number of mistreated , unwanted or abandoned animals the variety of applications , as well as the versatile utility of the species , appears sufficient to keep rabbit raising a going concern in one aspect or another around the planet sub-par or '' cull '' animals from other breeding goals ( laboratory , exhibition , show , wool , or pet ) may also be used for meat , particularly in smallholder operations counterintuitively , the giant rabbit breeds are rarely used for meat production , due to their extended growth rates ( which lead to high feed costs ) and their large bone size ( which reduces the percentage of their weight that is usable meat ) in contrast to the multitude of breeds and types used in smaller operations , breeds such as the new zealand and the californian , along with hybrids of these breeds , are most frequently utilized for meat in commercial rabbitries advances in nutrition , such as those published by the usda rabbit research station , resulted in greater health for breeding animals and the survival of young stock current practices include the option of re-breeding the doe within a few days of delivery ( closely matching the behavior of wild rabbits during the spring and early summer , when forage availability is at its peak in efficient production systems , rabbits can turn 20 percent of the proteins they eat into edible meat , compared to 22 to 23 percent for broiler chickens , 16 to 18 percent for pigs and 8 to 12 percent for beef ; rabbit meat is more economical in terms of feed energy than beef within china itself , rabbits are raised in many provinces , with most of the rabbit meat ( about 70 % of the national production , equaling some 420,000 tons annually ) being consumed in the sichuan basin ( sichuan province and chongqing ) , where it is particularly popular however , since the american fuzzy lop and jersey wooly are both dwarf breeds , only the much larger angora breeds such as the english angora , satin angora , giant angora , and french angora are used for commercial wool production their long fur is sheared , combed , or plucked ( gently pulling loose hairs from the body during molting ) and then spun into yarn used to make a variety of products the environmental health perspective , published by the national institute of health , states , '' the rabbit is an extremely valuable model for studying the effects of chemicals or other stimuli on the male reproductive system '' according to the humane society of the united states , rabbits are also used extensively in the study of asthma , stroke prevention therapys , cystic fibrosis , diabetes , and cancer the use of rabbits for the draize test , which is used for , amongst other things , testing cosmetics on animals , has been cited as an example of cruelty in animal research modern methods for housing domestic rabbits vary from region to region around the globe and by type of rabbit , technological or financial opportunities and constraints , intended use , number of animals kept , and the particular preferences of the owner or farmer various goals include maximizing number of animals per land unit ( especially common in areas with high land values or small living areas ) minimizing labor , reducing cost , increasing survival and health of animals , and meeting specific market requirements ( such as for clean wool , or rabbits raised on pasture ) specifically as relates to rabbits , this type of production was nearly universal prior to germ theory understanding of infectious parasites ( especially coccidia ) and the role of nutrition in prevention of abortion and reproductive loss the most extensive rabbit '' keeping '' methods would be the harvest of wild or feral rabbits for meat or fur market , such as occurred in australia prior to the 1990s pasturing rabbits within a fence ( but not a cage ) , also known as colony husbandry , has not been commonly pursued due to the high death rate from weather and predators more commonly ( but still rare in terms of absolute numbers of rabbits and practitioners ) is the practice of confining the rabbits to a moveable cage with an open or slatted floor so that the rabbits can access grass but still be kept at hand and protected from weather and predators hutches or cages for this type of husbandry are generally made of a combination of wood and metal wire , made portable enough for a person to move the rabbits daily to fresh ground , and of a size to hold a litter of 6 to 12 rabbits at the market weight of in the early 1900s , as animal fancy in general began to emerge , rabbit fanciers began to sponsor rabbit exhibitions and fairs in western europe and the united states what became known as the '' belgian hare boom '' began with the importation of the first belgian hares from england in 1888 and soon after the founding of the first rabbit club in america , the american belgian hare association the american rabbit breeders association ( arba ) was founded in 1910 and is the national authority on rabbit raising and rabbit breeds , having a uniform '' standard of perfection '' , registration and judging system the study of rabbit genetics is of interest to medical researchers , fanciers , and the fur and meat industries in the biomedical research community and the pharmaceutical industry , rabbits genetics are important for producing antibodies , toxicity test , and in model organism research among rabbit fanciers and in the fiber and fur industry , the genetics of coat color and hair properties are paramount ) a ( t ) : tan pattern ( otter , tan , silver marten ) a : self- or non-agouti ( black , chocolate ) '' b '' represents the brown locus the genes are : b : black ( chestnut agouti , black otter , black ) b : brown ( chocolate agouti , chocolate otter , chocolate ) '' c '' represents the color locus d : dense color ( chestnut agouti ,
