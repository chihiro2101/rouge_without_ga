during the middle ordovician period ( about 458-470 million years ago ) , a change in plate motions set the stage for the first paleozoic mountain building event ( taconic orogeny ) in north america the once quiet appalachian passive margin changed to a very active plate boundary when a neighboring oceanic plate , the iapetus , collided with and began sinking beneath the north american craton this was just the first of a series of mountain building plate collisions that contributed to the formation of the appalachians the massive bulk of pangea was completed near the end of the paleozoic era ( permian period ) when africa ( gondwana ) plowed into the continental agglomeration , with the appalachian-ouachita mountains near the core the appalachian mountains span across five geologic provinces ( as defined by the usgs ) : the appalachian basin , the blue ridge mountains , the piedmont province , the adirondack province , and the new england province a complexly thrust faulted and folded terrane ( appalachian fold and thrust belt or eastern overthrust belt ) , formed at the end of the paleozoic by the alleghenian orogeny , characterizes the eastern flank of the basin metamorphic and igneous rocks of the blue ridge thrust belt that bounds the eastern part of the appalachian basin province were thrust westward more than over lower paleozoic sedimentary rocks a second major trend of oil and gas production in the appalachian basin began with the discovery in 1885 of oil and gas in lower silurian clinton sandstone reservoirs in knox county , ohio along its western margin , the blue ridge is thrust over the folded and faulted margin of the appalachian basin , so that a broad segment of paleozoic strata extends eastward for tens of miles , buried beneath these subhorizontal crystalline thrust sheets at the surface , the blue ridge consists of a mountainous to hilly region , the main component of which are the blue ridge mountains that extend from georgia to pennsylvania the province is bounded on the north and west by the paleozoic strata of the appalachian basin province and on the south by cretaceous and younger sedimentary rocks of the gulf coastal plain the adirondack and new england provinces include sedimentary , metasedimentary , and plutonic igneous rocks , mainly of cambrian and ordovician age , similar lithologically to rocks in the blue ridge and piedmont provinces to the south
