a desert planet with no natural precipitation , in dune it is established that arrakis had been '' his imperial majesty 's desert botanical testing station '' before the discovery of melange , for which it is the only natural source in the universe melange ( or , '' the spice '' ) is the most essential and valuable commodity in the universe , as it extends life and makes safe interstellar travel possible ( among other uses ) as indicated by its large salt flats , arrakis once had lakes and oceans ; lady jessica also notes in dune that wells drilled in the sinks and basins initially produce a '' trickle '' of water which soon stops , as if '' something plugs it '' paul atreides recalls that the few plants and animals on the planet include '' saguaro , burro bush , date palm , sand verbena , evening primrose , barrel cactus , incense bush , smoke tree , creosote bush & nbsp ; it is suggested the sandworms are an introduced species that caused the desertification of arrakis ; in children of dune ( 1976 ) , leto ii atreides explains to his twin sister ghanima : the sandtrout the non-canon dune encyclopedia ( 1984 ) theorizes that the depletion of the oceans ( the primary result of which was desertification ) was probably caused by the impact or near miss of a comet or other quasi-planetary body the mass extinction of all of its predators and competitors for food allowed the animal , in a manner somewhat analogous to the evolution of unique faunal forms on isolated terran islands , to take the evolutionary path that would not only re-oxygenate the arrakeen atmosphere , but also create the spice melange with all of its immense consequences for humanity finally , the encyclopedia notes that early in the history of arrakis , the imperium made several attempts to terraform the planet , which resulted in an abundance of earth desert life on the planet ( such as kangaroo mice and hawks ) , but failed to otherwise change the environment , as the local sandtrout '' encyst '' any open water on the planet the best-known of the sietches is sietch tabr , home of stilgar and muad'dib 's center of operations before victory in the battle of arrakeen put muad'dib on the imperial throne anderson , it was a group of zensunni wanderers escaping slavery on the planet poritrin who originally crashed on dune in a prototype heighliner several years prior to the creation of the spacing guild leto 's son paul atreides ( known by the fremen as muad'dib ) later leads a massive fremen army to victory over the emperor 's sardaukar soldier-fanatics , and by threatening the destruction of all spice production on arrakis manages to depose shaddam and ascend the throne in his place by the time of children of dune , alia atreides ( and then leto ii and ghanima ) realize that the ecological transformation of arrakis is altering the sandworm cycle , which would eventually result in the end of all spice production in heretics of dune , all life on arrakis is destroyed ( and the entire surface of the planet slagged into oblivion ) by the honored matres in a failed attempt to eliminate the latest duncan idaho ghola arrakeen housed an ostentatious palace , which had been '' the government mansion in the days of the old empire '' ; prior to the arrival of the atreides on arrakis , the emperor 's right-hand man count fenring and his wife margot had resided there '' in dune , leto 's concubine lady jessica has this first impression of the great hall : jessica stood in the center of the hall in his 1985 short work '' the road to dune '' ( published in the short story collection eye ) , frank herbert described the grand palace of arrakeen ( and other sites ) during the reign of paul atreides : your walking tour of arrakis must include this approach across the dunes to the grand palace at arrakeen the largest man-made structure ever built , the grand palace could cover more than ten of the imperium 's most populous cities under one roof , a fact that becomes more apparent when you learn atreides attendants and their families , housed spaciously in the palace annex , number some thirty-five million souls alia atreides , shown as '' the soother of pains , '' stands twenty-two meters tall but is one of the smallest adornments in the hall two hundred such statues could be stacked one atop the other against the entrance pillars and still fall short of the doorway 's capitol arch , which itself is almost a thousand meters below the first beams upholding the lower roof the famed '' sun-sweep window '' incorporates every solar calendar known to human history in the one translucent display whose brilliant colors , driven by the sun of dune , thread through the interior on prismatic pathways all imperial cities on arrakis are in the far-northern latitudes of the planet and protected from the violent weather of arrakis by a natural formation known as the shield wall there are other cities scattered in the northern regions of the planet ( especially near the ice cap , where water is harvested ) , as well as the fremen sietch communities scattered throughout the desert the fictional desert planet of tatooine in the star wars franchise was inspired by the desert planet of arrakis in dune
