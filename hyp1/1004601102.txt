body—inhumation ( burial ) , cremation , or exposure—have gone through periods of preference throughout history homer 's account of patroclus ' burial describes cremation with subsequent burial in a tumulus , similar to urnfield burials , and qualifying as the earliest description of cremation rites this may be an anachronism , as during mycenaean times burial was generally preferred , and homer may have been reflecting the more common use of cremation at the time the iliad was written , centuries later criticism of burial rites is a common form of aspersion by competing religions and cultures , including the association of cremation with fire sacrifice or human sacrifice the rigveda contains a reference to the emerging practice , in rv 10.15.14 , where the forefathers '' both cremated ( agnidagdhá- ) and uncremated ( ánagnidagdha- ) '' are invoked this stance was influenced by its roots in judaism , the belief in the resurrection of the body , and the example of christ 's burial for example , the body of john wycliff was exhumed years after his death and burned to ashes , with the ashes thrown in a river , explicitly as a posthumous punishment for his denial of the roman catholic doctrine of transubstantiation in 1869 , the idea was presented to the medical international congress of florence by professors coletti and castiglioni '' in the name of public health and civilization '' a model of brunetti 's cremating apparatus , together with the resulting ashes , was exhibited at the vienna exposition in 1873 and attracted great attention meanwhile , sir charles william siemens had developed his open hearth furnace in the 1850s 21-23 ) sir henry thompson , 1st baronet , a surgeon and physician to the queen victoria , had seen gorini 's cremator at the vienna exhibition and had returned home to become the first and chief promoter of cremation in england in addition , he believed , cremation would prevent premature burial , reduce the expense of funerals , spare mourners the necessity of standing exposed to the weather during interment , and urns would be safe from vandalism by the end of the year , the cremation society of great britain had overseen two more cremations , a total of 3 out of 597,357 deaths in the uk that year some of the various protestant churches came to accept cremation , with the rationale being , '' god can resurrect a bowl of ashes just as conveniently as he can resurrect a bowl of dust '' in anglican and nordic protestant countries , cremation gained acceptance ( though did not yet become the norm ) first by the higher classes and cultural circles , and then by the rest of the population the 1908 catholic encyclopedia was critical of the development , referring to them as a '' sinister movement '' and associating them with freemasonry , although it said that '' there is nothing directly opposed to any dogma of the church in the practice of cremation in the netherlands , the foundation of the association for optional cremation dutch , vereniging voor facultatieve lijkverbranding in 1874 ushered in a long debate about the merits and demerits of cremation laws against cremation were challenged and invalidated in 1915 ( two years after the construction of the first crematorium in the netherlands ) , though cremation did not become legally recognised until 1955 during world war ii ( 1939–45 ) nazi germany used specially built furnaces in at least six extermination camps throughout occupied poland including at auschwitz-birkenau , chełmno , belzec , majdanek , sobibor and treblinka , where the bodies of those murdered by gassing were disposed of using incineration the holocaust furnaces were supplied by a number of manufacturers , with the best known and most common being topf and sons as well as kori company of berlin , whose ovens were elongated to accommodate two bodies , slid inside from the back side these furnaces , based around a design commonly used for hospital incinerators , instead vented the gasses down through a series of ducts embedded in the floor , with the help of a draft fan located at the far end of the structure this is done on the condition that the ashes must be buried or interred , not scattered many countries where burial is traditional saw cremation rise to become a significant , if not the most common way of disposing of a dead body in the united kingdom , the body is not removed from the coffin and is not placed into a container as described above the code of cremation practice forbids the opening of the coffin once it has arrived at the crematorium , and rules stipulate that it must be cremated within 72 hours of the funeral service code of cremation practice , doncaster : cemeteries , crematorium , retrieved 26 november 2009 therefore , in the united kingdom , bodies are cremated in the same coffin that they are placed in at the undertaker 's , although the regulations allow the use of an approved '' cover '' during the funeral service when cremation is finished , the remains are passed through a magnetic field to remove any metal , which will be interred elsewhere in the crematorium grounds or , increasingly , recycled the ashes are entered into a cremulator to further grind the remains down into a finer texture before being given to relatives or loved ones or scattered in the crematorium grounds where facilities exist cremations can be '' delivery only '' , with no preceding chapel service at the crematorium ( although a church service may have been held ) or preceded by a service in

, the greater portion of the body ( especially the organs and other soft tissues ) is vaporized and oxidized by the intense heat ; gases released are discharged through the exhaust system after the incineration is completed , the dry bone fragments are swept out of the retort and pulverised by a machine called a cremulator—essentially a high-capacity , high-speed blender—to process them into '' ashes '' or '' cremated remains '' , '' cremulator '' is a trademark of dwf europe this leaves the bone with a fine sand like texture and color , able to be scattered without need for mixing with any foreign matter , though the size of the grain varies depending on the cremulator used the appearance of cremated remains after grinding is one of the reasons they are called ashes , although a non-technical term sometimes used is '' cremains '' , a portmanteau of '' cremated '' and '' remains '' ( the cremation association of north america prefers that the word '' cremains '' not be used for referring to '' human cremated remains '' the reason given is that '' cremains '' is thought to have less connection with the deceased , whereas a loved one 's '' cremated remains '' has a more identifiable human connection ) after final grinding , the ashes are placed in a container , which can be anything from a simple cardboard box to a decorative urn because many changes in body composition ( such as fat and muscle loss or gain ) do not affect the weight of cremated remains , the weight of the remains can be more closely predicted from the person 's height and sex ( which predicts skeletal weight ) , than it can be predicted from the person 's simple weight eisenberg , the scoop on breasts : a plastic surgeon busts the myths , incompra press , 2012 , some medical devices such as pacemakers may need to be removed before cremation to avoid the risk of explosion large items such as titanium hip replacements ( which tarnish but do not melt ) or casket hinges are usually removed before processing , as they may damage the processor after the remains are processed , smaller bits of metal such as tooth fillings , and rings ( commonly known as gleanings ) are sieved out and may be later interred in common , consecrated ground in a remote area of the cemetery in the united states , the cremated remains are almost always contained in a thick watertight polyethylene plastic bag contained within a hard snap-top rectangular plastic container , which is labeled with a printed paper label an official certificate of cremation prepared under the authority of the crematorium accompanies the remains , and if required by law , the permit for disposition of human remains , which must remain with the cremated remains cremated remains can be kept in an urn , stored in a special memorial building ( columbarium ) , buried in the ground at many locations or sprinkled on a special field , mountain , or in the sea in addition , there are several services in which the cremated remains will be scattered in a variety of ways and locations cremated remains may also be incorporated , with urn and cement , into part of an artificial reef , or they can also be mixed into paint and made into a portrait of the deceased a portion of the cremated remains may be retained in a specially designed locket known as cremation jewelry , or even blown into special glass keepsakes and glass orbs in some areas such as snowdon , wales , environmental authorities have warned that the frequent scattering of ashes can change the nature of the soil , and may affect the ecology ) of the deceased to immerse the cremated remains in the holy river ganges , preferably at one of the holy cities triveni sangam , allahabad , varanasi , or haridwar in india in southern india , the ashes are immersed in the river kaveri at paschima vahini in srirangapattana at a stretch where the river flows from east to west , depicting the life of a human being from sunrise to sunset in

cremation urn generally speaking , cremation is cheaper than a traditional burial service , especially if direct cremation is chosen , in which the body is cremated as soon as legally possible without any sort of services some religions , such as catholic church , require the burial or entombment of cremated remains , but burial of cremated remains may often be accomplished in the burial plot of another person , such as a family member , without any additional cost this option is charged for in england in an anglican church where the fee is set by the table of parochial fees ( £36 to incumbent and £78 to church council ) a total of £114 in 2010 with a marker charged as extra it is also very common to scatter the remains in a place the deceased liked—such as the sea , a river , a beach , a park , or mountains , following their last will some persons choose to have a small part of their ashes ( usually less than 1 part in 1000 , because of cost constraints ) scattered in space ( known as space burial and offered by companies such as elysium space , celestis and ascending memories ) studies by elisabeth keijzer for the netherlands organisation for applied research found that cremation has less of an environmental impact than a traditional burial ( the study did not address natural burials ) , while the newer method of alkaline hydrolysis ( sometimes called green cremation or resomation ) had less impact than both the environmental impact may be reduced by using cremators for longer periods , and relaxing the requirement for a cremation to take place on the same day that the coffin is received , which reduces the use of fossil fuel and hence carbon emissions in early 2002 , 334 corpses that were supposed to have been cremated in the previous few years at the tri-state crematory were found intact and decaying on the crematorium 's grounds in the u.s the tsunamis killed people over an area ranging from the immediate vicinity of the quake in southeast asia ( indonesia , thailand , and the northwestern coast of malaysia ) , to thousands of kilometers away in the indian subcontinent ( bangladesh , india , sri lanka , the maldives ) , the horn of africa ( somalia ) , and the african great lakes ( kenya and tanzania ) according to the national funeral directors association the cremation rate in the united states in 2016 was 50.2 percent and this was expected to increase to 63.8 percent by 2025 and 78.8 percent in 2035
