dorgon was born in the manchu aisin gioro clan as the 14th son of nurhaci , the khan of the later jin dynasty ( the precursor to the qing dynasty ) dorgon was one of the most influential among nurhaci 's sons , and his role was instrumental to the qing occupation of beijing , the capital of the fallen ming dynasty , in 1644 after hong taiji died in 1643 , dorgon became involved in a power struggle with hong taiji 's eldest son , hooge , over the succession to the throne the conflict was resolved with a compromise – both backed out , and hong taiji 's ninth son , fulin , ascended the throne as the shunzhi emperor . hearing the news , dorgon 's han chinese advisors hong chengchou and fan wencheng ( 范文程 ; 1597–1666 ) urged the prince to seize this opportunity to present themselves as avengers of the fallen ming empire and claim the mandate of heaven for the qing empire yet , at the same time , as he claimed to have come to avenge the ming empire , dorgon ordered that all claimants to the ming throne ( including descendants of the last ming emperor ) should be executed along with their supporters besides , all the men had to shave the front half of their heads and wear the rest of their hair in queues . the southern cadet branch of confucius 's descendants who held the title wujing boshi and the northern branch 65th generation descendant of confucius to hold the title duke yansheng had their titles confirmed by the shunzhi emperor on 31 october a formal ritual of enthronement for the shunzhi emperor was held on 8 november , during which the young emperor compared dorgon 's achievements to those of the duke of zhou , a revered regent of the zhou dynasty 858 and 860 ( '' according to the emperor 's speechwriter , who was probably fan wencheng , dorgon even 'surpassed ' ( guo ) the revered duke of zhou because 'the uncle prince also led the grand army through shanhai pass to smash two hundred thousand bandit soldiers , and then proceeded to take yanjing , pacifying the central xia during the ceremony , dorgon 's official title was raised from '' prince regent '' to '' uncle and prince regent '' ( 叔父攝政王 ) , in which the manchu term for '' uncle '' ( ecike ) represented a rank higher than that of imperial prince . in june 1645 , dorgon eventually decreed that all official documents should refer to him as '' imperial uncle prince regent '' ( 皇叔父攝政王 ) , leaving him one step short of claiming the throne for himself to promote ethnic harmony , a 1648 decree from the shunzhi emperor allowed han chinese civilian men to marry manchu women from the banners with the permission of the board of revenue if they were registered daughters of officials or commoners or the permission of their banner company captain if they were unregistered commoners , it was only later in the qing dynasty that these policies allowing intermarriage were done away with the yellow banners were given the place of honor north of the palace , followed by the white banners to the east , the red banners to the west , and the blue banners to the south under the shunzhi emperor 's reign , the average number of graduates of the metropolitan examination per session was the highest of the qing dynasty ( '' to win more chinese support '' ) , continuing until 1660 when lower quotas were established under the reign of dorgon – whom historians have called '' the mastermind of the qing conquest '' and '' the principal architect of the great manchu enterprise '' – the qing subdued almost all of china and pushed loyalist '' southern ming '' resistance into the far southwestern reaches of china after repressing anti-qing revolts in hebei and shandong in the summer and fall of 1644 , dorgon sent armies to root out li zicheng from the important city of xi'an ( shaanxi province ) , where li had reestablished his headquarters after fleeing beijing in early june 1644 . from newly captured xi'an , in early april 1645 , the qing forces mounted a campaign against the rich commercial and agricultural region of jiangnan south of the lower yangtze river , where in june 1644 prince of fu had established a regime loyal to the ming . the qing forces soon captured the ming emperor ( who died in beijing the following year ) and seized jiangnan 's main cities , including suzhou and hangzhou ; by early july 1645 , the frontier between the qing empire and the southern ming regime had been pushed south to the qiantang river ( capture of suzhou and hangzhou by early july 1645 ; new frontier ) ; ( capture of the emperor around 17 june , and later death in beijing ) the old chinese habit of wearing a queue came from dorgon 's july 1645 edict ordering all men to shave the front half of their head and wear the rest of their hair in a queue similar to those of the manchus on 21 july 1645 , after jiangnan had been superficially pacified , dorgon issued a most inopportune edict ordering all han chinese men to shave the front half of their heads and wear the rest of their hair in queues identical to those of the manchus in the classic of filial piety , confucius is cited as '' a person 's body and hair , being gifts from one 's parents , are not to be damaged : this is the beginning of filial piety '' ( 身體髮膚，受之父母，不敢毀傷，孝之始也 ) ( '' broke the momentum of the qing conquest '' ) ; ( '' the hair-cutting order , more than any other act , engendered the kiangnan jiangnan resistance of 1645 '' ) ; ( '' the rulers ' effort to make manchus and han one unified 'body ' initially had the effect of unifying upper- and lower-class natives in central and south china against the interlopers '' ) after the fall of nanjing , two more members of the ming imperial household created new southern ming regimes : one centred in coastal fujian around the '' longwu emperor '' zhu yujian – a ninth-generation descendant of the hongwu emperor , the ming dynasty 's founder – and one in zhejiang around '' regent '' zhu yihai , prince of lu he was posthumously granted the title '' emperor yi '' ( 義皇帝 ) and the temple name '' chengzong '' ( 成宗 ) , even though he was never emperor during his lifetime , which is unique in all history of feudal china when only direct ancestors and deceased heirs of a higher degree to an emperor ( such as one 's own older brothers , one 's father 's older brothers , or one 's cousins born into such uncles ) were posthumously granted the title of emperor another cause for suspicion is that dorgon 's corpse was exhumed , flogged , and incinerated in the purge ordered by emperor shunzhi , a likely method camouflaged as the ultimate punishment for his alleged plot to take over the throne , in order to remove all evidence that dorgon was murdered in 1651 , dorgon 's political enemies , led by his former co-regent jirgalang , submitted to the shunzhi emperor a long memorial listing a series of crimes committed by dorgon , which included : possession of yellow robes , which were strictly for use only by the emperor ; plotting to seize the throne from the shunzhi emperor by calling himself '' emperor 's father '' ; killing hooge and taking hooge 's wife for himself the last charge that dorgon took hooge 's wife was mostly contrived , as the manchu tradition dating from the 12th century had allowed a male relative to marry the deceased person 's wife almost as a charitable act to save her and her children from being starved to death in the minus 20 , merciless winters of the northeastern tip of china , known nowadays as manchuria as a result , shunzhi posthumously stripped dorgon of his titles and even had dorgon 's corpse exhumed and flogged in public in the february 1651 imperial edict trying to justify the ultimate punishment to a dead person as well as a key member of the imperial clan , shunzhi ordered that not only dorgon 's name be removed from the scrolls of the imperial ancestral temple with dodo dying of smallpox a few months prior to the death of dorgon in december 1650 and the death of ajige after he was arrested by jirgalang 's forces and put in jail , the 1651 purge was meant to permanently eliminate the potential that a future prince descending from empress xiaolewu would repeat the two dorgon competitions for succession to the throne happening in 1626 , upon the death of nurhaci , and 1643 , upon the death of hongtaiji in 1778 , the qianlong emperor granted dorgon a posthumous name zhong ( 忠 ; '' loyal '' ) , so dorgon 's full posthumous title became '' prince ruizhong of the first rank '' ( 和碩睿忠親王 ) qianlong , either intentionally or inadvertently , contradicted the records of the imperial ancestral temple left behind by shunzhi when he ordered that the words '' dorgon 's heirs having been exterminated '' ( 后嗣废绝 ) be included into official qing history to indicate why dorbo , a fifth generation descendant of dodo , was designated to inherit the iron-cap princely title of dorgon in the march 1651 purge of dorgon , shunzhi also ordered that the ancestral temple records be written to indicate that no woman had ever conceived a son for dorgon ( not that all of his sons had died due to infant mortality or some other reasons ) , to conceal this political conspiracy against dorgon and his two biological brothers , who had conquered more than half of china for the young qing empire since 1644 records in the imperial ancestral temple indicate that none of his 10 wives and concubines was able to conceive a son for dorgon over a period of 25 years , whereas only a daughter was born at the end of this 25-year period , in the same year when he died after successfully escaping execution , the camouflage to re-emerge as a han chinese person was considered perfect , as yuan 袁 ( yuen ) was also the family name of yuan chonghuan 袁崇煥 the han chinese general who fatally wounded nurhaci in the 1626 battle of ningyuan , making it highly unlikely that pursuing forces from the forbidden city would suspect that he and/or his descendants were members of the dorgon clan the village where his descendants have sprang up since 1651 was named '' revelation of the dragon 顯龍 '' , indicating his hope that one day someone in his line would be able to reclaim the throne , which never happened through the remaining years of the qing dynasty after dorgon led manchu and han chinese troops loyal to him into beijing on june 6 , 1644 , he immediately ordered restoration of order , as well as penalties for extortion and corruption activities conducted by any member of the imperial clan and other officials 阎崇年，《清十二帝疑案》 these were policies designed to bolster the rule of the qing conquerors , but which caused considerable disturbance and bloodshed in china , and included : forced head-shaving ( 剃发 ) and adopting manchu clothing ( 易服 ) : chinese men were compelled to shave the front half of their heads and tie their hair in queues after the manchu fashion , on pain of death
