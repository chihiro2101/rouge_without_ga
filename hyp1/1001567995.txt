for example , if a group g is finitely generated and the order of each element of g is a divisor of 4 , then g is finite ) issai schur had showed in 1911 that any finitely generated periodic group that was a subgroup of the group of invertible n × n complex matrices was finite ; he used this theorem to prove the jordan–schur theorem in 1964 , golod and shafarevich constructed an infinite group of burnside type without assuming that all elements have uniformly bounded order if g is a finitely generated , periodic group , then is g necessarily finite ? this question was answered in the negative in 1964 by evgeny golod and igor shafarevich , who gave an example of an infinite p-group that is finitely generated ( see golod–shafarevich theorem ) however , the orders of the elements of this group are not a priori bounded by a single constant part of the difficulty with the general burnside problem is that the requirements of being finitely generated and periodic give very little information about the possible structure of a group if g is a finitely generated group with exponent n , is g necessarily finite ? it turns out that this problem can be restated as a question about the finiteness of groups in a particular family for which positive integers m , n is the free burnside group b ( m , n ) finite ? the full solution to burnside problem in this form is not known a famous class of counterexamples to the burnside problem is formed by finitely generated non-cyclic infinite groups in which every nontrivial proper subgroup is a finite cyclic group , the so-called tarski monsters in 1982 ol'shanskii was able to strengthen his results to establish existence , for any sufficiently large prime number p ( one can take p > 10 75 ) of a finitely generated infinite group in which every nontrivial proper subgroup is a cyclic group of order p if it is known that a group g with m generators and exponent n is finite , can one conclude that the order of g is bounded by some constant depending only on m and n ? equivalently , are there only finitely many finite groups with m generators of exponent n , up to isomorphism ? this variant of the burnside problem can also be stated in terms of certain universal groups with m generators and exponent n by basic results of group theory , the intersection of two subgroups of finite index in any group is itself a subgroup of finite index let m be the intersection of all subgroups of the free burnside group b ( m , n ) which have finite index , then m is a normal subgroup of b ( m , n ) ( otherwise , there exists a subgroup g −1 mg with finite index containing elements not in m ) the restricted burnside problem then asks whether b 0 ( m , n ) is a finite group
