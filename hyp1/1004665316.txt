author daniel quinn , first in his book ishmael ( 1992 ) and later in the story of b ( 1996 ) , proposes that the story of cain and abel is an account of early semitic herdsmen observing the beginnings of what he calls totalitarian agriculture , with cain representing the first 'modern ' agriculturists and abel the pastoralism modern scholars typically view the stories of adam and eve and cain and abel to be about the development of civilization during the age of agriculture ; not the beginnings of man , but when people first learned agriculture , replacing the ways of the hunter-gatherer a prominent mesopotamian parallel to cain and abel is the sumerian myth of the courtship of inanna and dumuzid , in which the shepherd dumuzid and the farmer enkimdu compete for the affection of the goddess inanna , with dumuzid ( the shepherd ) winning out like almost all of the persons , places and stories in the primeval history ( the first eleven chapters of genesis ) , they are mentioned nowhere else in the hebrew bible , a fact that suggests that the history is a late composition attached to genesis to serve as an introduction and cain said to abel his brother , '' let us go out to the field , '' and when they were in the field cain rose against abel his brother and killed him adapted from ibn abul-hatim 's narrative in tafsir al-qur'an al-adhim and tafsir al-tabari , surat al-ma'ida a different tradition narrates that while cain was quarreling with abel , the devil killed an animal with a stone in cain 's sight to show him how to murder abel '' and the lord said to cain , '' where is abel your brother ? and he said , '' i do not know : am i my brother 's keeper ?
