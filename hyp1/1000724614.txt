the prisoners of these sea battles were eventually executed in 1523 for crimes of '' robbery in the high seas '' and cannibalism , while tomé pires was kept prisoner so that he could write letters to the king of portugal , the viceroy of portuguese india , and the governor of malacca conveying the jiajing emperor message that the portuguese should leave malacca and restore it to the rightful rule of its deposed king although fernão pires de andrade and his portuguese comrades were the first to open up china to the west , another significant diplomatic mission reaching all the way to beijing would not be carried out until an italian , the jesuit matteo ricci ( 1552 & ndash ; 1610 ) ventured there in 1598 however , there were no official reports of simão 's abuses , even though he stayed until september 1520 ; yet rumors of his behavior ( which became associated with all portuguese ) no doubt reached as far as the court of beijing , which would soon condemn the portuguese for this and other reasons a similar episode occurred later when coelho de sousa seized the house of a wealthy foreign resident in jinzhou of fujian , which led authorities to cut off supplies to the portuguese ; the portuguese then attacked and ransacked a nearby village for supplies , which prompted chinese authorities to destroy thirteen of their ships while thirty portuguese survivors of this settlement fled to the portuguese macau in 1549 other survivors of these missions retired to nearby lampaco ( lampa ) in guangdong , where a trade post would exist for several decades ; in 1537 , there were written records of the portuguese having three warehouses at lampa , shangchuan island , and macau , and were initially allowed there with the excuse of drying their goods in a storm the portuguese historian joão de barros ( 1496 & ndash ; 1570 ) wrote that when a violent storm arose as albuquerque 's fleet entered the vast waters between sri lanka and aceh , a ship commanded by simão martinho was sunk , but his entire crew was rescued by fernão and taken aboard his ship in 1554 , leonel de sousa—a later governor of macau— established positive relations through luso-chinese agreement ( 1554 ) denis crispin twitchett , john king fairbank , the cambridge history of china , volume 2 ; volume 8 , cambridge university press , 1978 , and in 1557 the ming court finally gave consent for a permanent and official portuguese trade base at macau by some accounts , fernão pires de andrade simply died while imprisoned ; others say andrade was one of those beheaded when a crime of false credentials was placed upon him after a court examined if his embassy was legitimate or spurious due to negative accounts of the portuguese ( i.e while writing of afonso de albuquerque 's ventures in sumatra , joão de barros noted that the chinese were the first to control trade between sumatra and india , and noted the presence of chinese people living in sumatra however , with his death , eunuch influence at court was challenged by yang tinghe , who announced the rejection of the portuguese embassy under pires and andrade the day after the emperor 's death ; the embassy was forced to leave and arrived back in canton in september image : retrato de afonso de albuquerque ( após 1545 ) - autor desconhecido.png thumb right afonso de albuquerque , who launched the attack to conquer the malacca sultanate and commissioned the first direct european maritime contacts with china during the ming dynasty image : zhengde.jpg thumb right the zhengde emperor , who accepted the portuguese embassy but died before he could finalize relations with portugal , hence dooming the embassy as conservative factions at court in beijing were aligned against those who conquered the ming 's loyal tributary vassal in malacca simão continued to defy local chinese laws at ningbo , and when his men were cheated on a trade deal with a chinese man in 1545 , simão sent a band of armed men into the town , pillaged it , and took local women and young girls as their captives barros also noted that while fernão pires was loading southeast asian spices onto his ship in pacem ( a kingdom in sumatra ) in order to sell or present them as gifts in china , two different kings were killed and their position usurped although no chinese sources detail the event , portuguese sources tell of how the portuguese were summoned on the first and fifteenth days of each lunar month to ceremoniously prostrate themselves before a wall of the forbidden city to seek another audience with the emperor fernão pires de andrade commanded a vessel in the naval venture of the portuguese explorer and conqueror afonso de albuquerque from cochin in india to conquer the malacca sultanate in 1511 when portuguese under diogo lopes de sequeira had earlier arrived in malacca in 1509 to open trade relations , he was supported by the local chinese merchants there ( along with javanese and tamil merchants ) florence merchant giovanni da empoli , who had written a report about trade with china while stationed in india , was also chosen for the mission as the chief commercial agent between the portuguese and chinese the portuguese embassy had also become aware that ambassadors from the mahmud shah of malacca were sent to beijing seeking assistance from the chinese emperor in expelling the conquering portuguese so that their king could be reinstalled there the chinese became suspicious once again of andrade , this time for being a spy , when he sent a ship along the fujian coast to look for further trade prospects , but he left a good impression when he gave the order that any locals who might be harmed by a portuguese should seek him for redress apparently the usurpation of kings caused little tumult or crisis in this state , as barros noted any leader there was believed by the locals not to have divine right to rule if he was able to be killed by a royal kinsman despite initial hostilities , good relations between the portuguese and chinese would resume in 1549 with annual portuguese trade missions to shangchuan island , following an event where the portuguese helped ming authorities eliminate coastal pirates although the local canton officials watched the portuguese and their ships closely , once the province ( china ) arrived at canton they greeted the portuguese with a warm reception , providing them comfortable lodgings and had their trade goods brought ashore once the ships sailed into port at canton , they alarmed the chinese residents and officials there by discharging cannon fire , what they believed was a friendly salute since the chinese merchants had done so when the portuguese earlier arrived in malacca
