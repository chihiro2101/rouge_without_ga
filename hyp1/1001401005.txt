their most famous was the lion , which had been a very successful engine between the world wars and in modified form had powered several of the supermarine schneider trophy competitors in 1923 and 1927 , as well as several land speed record cars in these new designs , napier chose air cooling but in service , the rear cylinders proved to be impossible to cool properly , which made the engines unreliable during the 1930s , studies showed the need for engines capable of developing one horsepower per cubic inch of displacement ( about 45 & nbsp ; kw/litre ) a typical large engine of the era , the pratt & whitney r-1830 twin wasp , developed about 1,200 & nbsp ; hp ( 895 & nbsp ; kw ) from 1,830 cubic inches ( 30 litres ) , so an advance of some 50 percent would be needed in it , he wrote that traditional poppet valve engines would be unlikely to produce much more than 1,500 & nbsp ; hp ( 1,100 & nbsp ; kw ) , a figure that many companies were eyeing for next generation engines to pass this limit , the sleeve valve would have to be used , to increase volumetric efficiency , as well as to decrease the engine 's sensitivity to detonation , which was prevalent with the poor quality fuels in use at the time engines and enterprise : the life and work of sir harry ricardo , john reynolds,1999 , p.145 halford had worked for ricardo 1919-1922 at their london office and halford 's 1923 office was in ladbroke grove , north kensington , only a few miles from ricardo , while halford 's 1929 office was even closer ( 700 yards ) , engines and enterprise : the life and work of sir harry ricardo , john reynolds,1999 , p.103 boxkite to jet - the remarkable career of frank b halford , douglas taylor , 1999 , , p.73 and while in 1927 ricardo started work with bristol engines on a line of sleeve-valve designs , engines and enterprise : the life and work of sir harry ricardo , john reynolds,1999 , p.186 halford started work with napier , boxkite to jet - the remarkable career of frank b halford , douglas taylor , 1999 , , p.81 using the dagger as the basis the layout of the h-block , with its inherent balance and the sabre 's relatively short stroke , allowed it to run at a higher rate of rotation , to deliver more power from a smaller displacement , provided that good volumetric efficiency could be maintained ( with better breathing ) , which sleeve valves could do engines and enterprise : the life and work of sir harry ricardo , john reynolds,1999 , p.187 the napier company decided first to develop a large 24 cylinder liquid–cooled engine , capable of producing at least 2,000 & nbsp ; hp ( 1,491 & nbsp ; kw ) in late 1935 all of the accessories were grouped conveniently above and below the cylinder blocks , rather than being at the front and rear of the engine , as in most contemporary designs the air ministry supported the sabre programme with a development order in 1937 for two reasons : to provide an alternative engine if the rolls-royce vulture and the bristol centaurus failed as the next generation of high power engines and to keep napier in the aero-engine industry industry and air power the expansion of british aircraft production 1935-1941 , sebastian ritchie 2007 , routledge taylor and francis group , , p.140 the first sabre engines were ready for testing in january 1938 , although they were limited to 1,350 & nbsp ; hp ( 1,000 & nbsp ; kw ) by march , they were passing tests at 2,050 & nbsp ; hp ( 1,500 & nbsp ; kw ) and by june 1940 , when the sabre passed the air ministry 's 100-hour test , the first production versions were delivering 2,200 & nbsp ; hp ( 1,640 & nbsp ; kw ) from their 2,238 cubic inch ( 37 litre ) displacements the sleeves often failed due to the way they were manufactured from chrome-molybdenum steel , leading to seized cylinders , which caused the loss of the sole prototype martin-baker mb 3 the ministry of aircraft production was responsible for the development of the engine and arranged for sleeves to be machined by the bristol aeroplane company from their taurus engine forgings banks 1978 , airlife publications , , p.133 quality control proved to be inadequate , engines were often delivered with improperly cleaned castings , broken piston rings and machine cuttings left inside the engine mechanics were overworked trying to keep the sabres running and during cold weather they had to run them every two hours during the night so that the engine oil would not congeal and prevent the engine from starting the next day to make matters worse , mechanics and pilots unfamiliar with the different nature of the engine , tended to blame the sabre for problems that were caused by not following correct procedures in 1942 , it started a series of projects to improve its high-altitude performance , with the addition of a three-speed , two-stage supercharger , when the basic engine was still not running reliably in december 1942 , the company was purchased by the english electric , which ended the supercharger project immediately and devoted the whole company to solving the production problems , which was achieved quickly by 1944 , the sabre v was delivering 2,400 horsepower ( 1,800 & nbsp ; kw ) consistently and the reputation of the engine started to improve this was the last version to enter service , being used in the hawker typhoon and its derivative , the hawker tempest by the end of world war ii , there were several engines in the same power class blackburn firebrand , only in 21 early production aircraft fairey battle , testbed folland fo.108 , testbed hawker fury , prototype ( 2 built ( la610 , vp207 ) , 485 & nbsp ;
