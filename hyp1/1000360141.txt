the livable streets study by donald appleyard ( 1981 ) found that residents of streets with light traffic had , on average , three more friends and twice as many acquaintances as the people on streets with heavy traffic which were otherwise similar in dimensions , income , etc traffic engineers refer to three '' e 's '' when discussing traffic calming : engineering , ( community ) education , and ( police ) enforcement engineering measures involve physically altering the road layout or appearance to actively or passively retard traffic by one of several means : increasing the cognitive load of driving ( making driving more difficult ) increasing the chance that an obstruction in the road will slow or momentarily stop motorists ( such as replacing a bus pullout with a bus bulb , causing transit vehicles to stop for passenger loading and unloading in the travel lane , rather than pulling off and letting cars pass ) increasing the chance of passenger discomfort or even physical damage to a vehicle if speed limits are not observed ( such as speed humps ) learning from hilden â€™ s successes , rod king , warrington cycle campaign , august 2004 ( accessed 24 january 2007 ) in 1999 , the netherlands had over 6000 woonerf where cyclists and pedestrians have legal priority over cars and where a motorised '' walking speed '' limit applies home zones briefing sheet , robert huxford , proceedings , institution of civil engineers , transport , 135 , 45-46 , february 1999 however , some uk and irish '' traffic calming '' schemes , particularly involving road narrowings , are viewed as extremely hostile and have been implicated directly in death and injury to cyclists and pedestrians ( accessed 27 january 2007 ) a number of visual changes to roads are being made to encourage more attentive driving , reduced speed , reduced crashes , and a greater tendency to yield to pedestrians visual traffic calming includes lane narrowings ( 9-10 ' ) , road diets ( reduction in lanes ) , use of trees next to streets , on-street parking , and buildings placed in urban fashion close to streets traffic calming can include the following engineering measures , grouped by similarity of method : narrowing : narrowing traffic lanes makes slower speeds seem more natural to drivers and are less intrusive than other treatments that limit speed or restrict route choice speed dips , sunken instead of raised ( often seen as double dips in cycleways in the netherlands ) changing the surface material or texture ( for example , the selective use of brick , cobblestone , or decorative concrete ) speed reduction , traffic calming or cycling facilities : a question of what best achieves the goals ?
