in addition to more mundane content such as poetry and marriage announcements , it contained a statement from the '' seceders from the church at nauvoo '' and sworn statements from multiple individuals attesting to the teaching of '' the plurality of wives '' ; statement from seceders the preamble establishes that despite the schism , the authors maintain their belief in '' the religion of the latter day saints , as originally taught by joseph smith '' the statement discusses the schism , attributed to '' many items of doctrine , as now taught , some of which , however , are taught secretly , and denied openly '' which they declare '' heretical and damnable '' they cite the '' false doctrine of many gods '' , saying '' it is contended that there are innumerable gods as much above the god that presides over this universe , as he is above us ; and if he varies from the law unto which he is subjected , he , with all his creatures , will be cast down as was lucifer '' '' the statement suggests that their struggle will be on-going , writing : '' we most solemnly and sincerely declare that the sword of truth shall not depart from the thigh , nor the buckler from the arm , until we can enjoy those glorious privileges which nature 's god and our country 's laws have guarantied to us—freedom of speech , the liberty of the press , and the right to worship god as seemeth us good '' they accuse smith and other church officials of introducing '' false and damnable doctrines into the church , such as a plurality of gods above the god of this universe , and his liability to fall with all his creations ; the plurality of wives , for time and eternity , the doctrine of unconditional sealing up to eternal life , against all crimes except that of shedding innocent blood smith called a meeting of the city council , where '' he proceeded to put the expositor and its editors on trial , as if that body was of a judicial instead of a legislative character '' after the city council declared the expositor a public nuisance , smith issued two orders for the expositors destruction non-mormons in hancock county were infuriated when they heard of the news of the destruction of the nauvoo expositor , believing that it was an example of mormon disregard for their laws on june 12 , the hancock county justice of the peace issued a warrant for the arrest of smith and 17 other named individuals under the jurisdiction of the hancock county court the meeting resolved to seek help from the governor , writing : whereas said smith and others refuse to obey the mandate of said writ ; and whereas in the opinion of this meeting , it is impossible for said officer so raise a posse of sufficient strength to execute said writ ; the following day , the warsaw signal published the resolutions , editorializing that '' repeated attempts have been made to arrest smith , but he has been uniformly screened from the officers of justice , by the aid of the municipal court of nauvoo , which is the tool and echo of himself '' in response , smith defended the expositors destruction to governor thomas ford , writing : in the investigation it appeared evident to the council that the proprietors were a set of unprincipled men , lawless , debouchees , counterfeiters , bogus makers , gamblers , peace disturbers , and that the grand object of said proprietors was to destroy our constitutional rights and chartered privileges ; to overthrow all good and wholesome regulations in society ; to strengthen themselves against the municipality ; to fortify themselves against the church of which i am a member , and destroy all our religious rights and privileges , by libels , slanders , falsehoods , perjury & sticking at no corruption to accomplish their hellish purposes and that said paper of itself was libelous of the deepest dye , and very injurious as a vehicle of defamation , —tending to corrupt the morals , and disturb the peace , tranquillity and happiness of the whole community , and especially that of nauvoo letter from joseph smith to thomas ford ( 14 june 1844 ) smith declared martial law on june 18 and called out the nauvoo legion , an organized city militia of about 5,000 men on june 22 , ford wrote to the mayor and city council of nauvoo , writing : i now express to you my opinion that your conduct in the destruction of the press was a very gross outrage upon the laws and the liberties of the people there are many newspapers in this state which have been wrongfully abusing me for more than a year , and yet such is my regard for the liberty of the press and the rights of a free people in a republican government that i would shed the last drop of my blood to protect those presses from any illegal violence on june 25 , 1844 , joseph and hyrum smith , along with the other fifteen co-defendants , surrendered to bettisworth on the original charge of inciting a riot on june 27 , while awaiting trial , a mob attacked the jail and death of joseph smith ; john taylor was wounded in the attack oaks opined that while the destruction of the expositors printing press was legally questionable , under the law of the time the newspaper could have been declared libelous and therefore a public nuisance by the nauvoo city council as a result , oaks concludes that while under contemporaneous law it would have been legally permissible for city officials to destroy , or '' abate , '' the actual printed newspapers , the destruction of the printing press itself was probably outside of the council 's legal authority , and its owners could have sued for damages
