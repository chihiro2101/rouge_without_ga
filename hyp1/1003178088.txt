dsps are usually optimized for streaming data and use special memory architectures that are able to fetch multiple data or instructions at the same time , such as the harvard architecture or modified von neumann architecture , which use separate program and data memories ( sometimes even concurrent access on multiple data buses ) such performance improvements have led to the introduction of digital signal processing in commercial communications satellites where hundreds or even thousands of analog filters , switches , frequency converters and so on are required to receive and process the uplinked signals and ready them for downlinking , and can be replaced with specialised dsps with significant benefits to the satellites ' weight , power consumption , complexity/cost of construction , reliability and flexibility of operation most general-purpose microprocessors and operating systems can execute dsp algorithms successfully , but are not suitable for use in portable devices such as mobile phones and pdas because of power efficiency constraints electronic signal processing was revolutionized in the 1970s by the wide adoption of the mosfet ( metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor , or mos transistor ) , mos integrated circuit technology was the basis for the first single-chip microprocessors and microcontrollers in the early 1970s , and then the first single-chip dsps in the late 1970s by the standards of general-purpose processors , dsp instruction sets are often highly irregular ; while traditional instruction sets are made up of more general instructions that allow them to perform a wider variety of operations , instruction sets optimized for digital signal processing contain instructions for common mathematical operations that occur frequently in dsp calculations many dsp applications have constraints on latency ; that is , for the system to work , the dsp operation must be completed within some fixed time , and deferred ( or batch ) processing is not viable dcts are also used for encoding operations such as motion estimation , motion compensation , inter-frame prediction , quantization , perceptual weighting , entropy encoding , variable encoding , and motion vectors , and decoding operations such as the inverse operation between different color formats ( yiq , yuv and rgb ) for display purposes multiply–accumulates ( macs , including fused multiply–add , fma ) operations used extensively in all kinds of matrix operations convolution for filtering dot product horner scheme fundamental dsp algorithms depend heavily on multiply–accumulate performance fir filters fast fourier transform ( fft ) related isa and instructions : simd vliw superscalar architecture specialized instructions for modulo addressing in ring buffers and bit-reversed addressing mode for fft cross-referencing dsps sometimes use time-stationary encoding to simplify hardware and increase coding efficiency the top models are capable of as many as 8000 mips ( millions of instructions per second ) , use vliw ( very long instruction word ) , perform eight operations per clock-cycle and are compatible with a broad range of external peripherals and various buses ( pci/serial/etc ) also , modern aircraft can not function without running tens of millions of computer instructions embedded and distributed throughout the aircraft and resident in both standard computer hardware and in specialized hardware components such as ic wired logic gates , analog and hybrid devices , and other digital components dcts are widely used for encoding , decoding , video coding , audio coding , multiplexing , control signals , signaling , analog-to-digital conversion , formatting luminance and color differences , and color formats such as yuv444 and yuv411 the s2281 was the first integrated circuit chip specifically designed as a dsp , and fabricated using vmos ( v-groove mos ) , a technology that had previously not been mass-produced the need to effectively model how separate physical components combine to form complex systems is important over a wide range of applications , including computers , personal digital assistants ( pdas ) , cell phones , surgical instrumentation , satellites , and submarines most dsps use fixed-point arithmetic , because in real world signal processing the additional range provided by floating point is not needed , and there is a large speed benefit and cost benefit due to reduced hardware complexity saturation arithmetic , in which operations that produce overflows will accumulate at the maximum ( or minimum ) values that the register can hold rather than wrapping around ( maximum+1 does n't overflow to minimum as in many general-purpose cpus , instead it stays at maximum ) product developers might also use floating point dsps to reduce the cost and complexity of software development in exchange for more expensive hardware , since it is generally easier to implement algorithms in floating point not all dsps provide the same speed and many kinds of signal processors exist , each one of them being better suited for a specific task , ranging in price from about us 1.50 to us 300 perhaps the best known and most widely deployed is the ceva-teaklite dsp family , a classic memory-based architecture , with 16-bit or 32-bit word-widths and single or dual macs introduced in 2004 , the dspic is designed for applications needing a true dsp as well as a true microcontroller , such as motor control and in power supplies a specialized dsp , however , will tend to provide a lower-cost solution , with better performance , lower latency , and no requirements for specialised cooling or large batteries most also support some of the features as an applications processor or microcontroller , since signal processing is rarely the only task of a system prior to the advent of stand-alone digital signal processor ( dsp ) chips , early digital signal processing applications were typically implemented using bit-slice chips ahmed in the early 1970s , and has since been widely implemented in dsp chips , with many companies developing dsp chips based on dct technology multiple arithmetic units may require memory architectures to support several accesses per instruction cycle -- typically supporting reading 2 data values from 2 separate data buses and the next instruction ( from the instruction cache , or a 3rd program memory ) simultaneously two years later in 1978 , they produced the first speak & spell , with the technological centerpiece being the tms5100 , the industry 's first digital signal processor both traditional and dsp-optimized instruction sets are able to compute any arbitrary operation but an operation that might require multiple arm or x86 instructions to compute might require only one instruction in a dsp optimized instruction set
