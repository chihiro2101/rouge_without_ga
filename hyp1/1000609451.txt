prospect of using cannon on rattlesnake hill , '' there was one hill in particular , which seem 'd to offer itself as an ally to us , it immediately commanded the lines from hence two small cannon well planted must have drove the french in a very short time from their breast work however , historian alistair fraser is of the opinion that stories of the flag 's presence on the battlefield appear to be a 19th-century fabrication , as there is no evidence that the large religious banner ( 2 by 3 meters , or 6 by 10 feet ) on which the flag design was based was actually used as a ensign at the battle 315–316 george iii , later in july 1758 , designated the 42nd a '' royal '' regiment , due to its gallantry in earlier battles , and issued letters of service for adding a second battalion '' as a testimony of his majesty 's satisfaction and approbation of the extraordinary courage , loyalty , and exemplary conduct of the highland regiment 206 as it happened , montreal ( the last point of resistance ) did not surrender until 1760 , with campaigns launched from fort oswego , quebec , and carillon , which was battle of ticonderoga ( 1759 ) by forces under the command of jeffery amherst , the victor at louisbourg the british amassed their army , under the command of general james abercrombie , near the remains of fort william henry , which lay at the southern end of lake george but had been destroyed following its capture by the french the previous year 26 the most serious geographic defect in the fort 's location was mount defiance ( known at the time of this battle as rattlesnake hill , and in the 1770s as sugar bush ) , which lay to the south of the fort , across the la chute river combined with the effective elimination of trépezet 's force on july 6 , there were about 550 casualties , about 13 percent of the french force , a percentage similar to the losses of the british ( who chartrand calculates as having lost 11.5 to 15 percent ) he had sent a messenger bearing a letter from vaudreuil to abercrombie ( part of a conventional exchange of pleasantries between opposing commanders ) on june 10 , expecting him to return ; the fact that the british held him was an indication that the messenger had probably learned too much just by being in the british camp vaudreuil , who had limited combat experience , wanted to divide the french forces , with about 5,000 each at carillon and louisbourg , and then send a picked force of about 3,500 men against the british in the mohawk river on the northwestern frontiers of the province of new york even though the fort was effectively battle of ticonderoga ( 1759 ) , future defenders of the fort and their superior officers , who may not have been familiar with the site 's shortcomings , fell under the spell of this idea robitaille as for the coat of arm under the madonna now erased , they were most probably that of charles , marquis of beauharnois ( 1671–1749 ) , governor of new france from 1726 to 1747 : silver on one side with a saber , mounted on three merlettes 243 abercrombie 's plan of attack omitted clerk 's recommendation to fortify the summit of rattlesnake hill ; in addition to the frontal assault , 4 six-pound guns and a howitzer were to be floated down the la chute river and mounted at the base of rattlesnake hill , with 20 bateaux of troops to support the effort embarking on a strategy that emphasized defense in europe , where france was strong , and offense in north america , where france was weak , he resolved to attack new france ( the colonial holdings of france in north america ) in three strategic campaigns 92 the lack of support from france was in large part due to an unwillingness of the french military to risk the movement of significant military forces across the atlantic ocean , which was dominated by britain 's royal navy 64 the sounds of battle led haviland to believe that the french line might have been penetrated , so he ordered his men forward , even though not all of the regulars were in place , and abercrombie had not given an order to advance the river was largely non-navigable , and there was a portage trail from the northern end of lake george to the location of a sawmill the french had built to assist in the fort 's construction 151–153 the french position was such that they were able to lay down withering fire on the british forces as they advanced , and the abatis ( a word that shares derivation with abattoir , or slaughterhouse ) rapidly became a killing field 162 he also sent word back to montreal of the situation , requesting that , if possible , the chevalier de lévis and his men , be sent as reinforcement ; these were troops that vaudreuil intended for duty at the western frontier forts montcalm , wary of a second british attack , and concerned about the fatigue of his troops after a long day of battle , had barrels of beer and wine brought forward to the lines following a french and indian war french victories , 1756–1757 , coupled with military setbacks in europe , william pitt gained full control of the direction of british military efforts in the seven years ' war abercrombie first landed an advance force to check the area where the forces were to disembark , and found it recently deserted ; some supplies and equipment had been left behind by the french in their hasty departure 142 early on the morning of july 8 , clerk went out once again to the base of rattlesnake hill to observe the french defenses ; his report indicated that he still felt the french lines could be taken by assault 114 he immediately detached bourlamaque and three battalions to occupy and fortify the river crossing on the portage trail about two miles ( 3.2 & nbsp ; km ) from the northern end of lake george , about from the fort in 1742 , the ghost of campbell 's dead brother is said to have appeared to him in a dream with a promise to meet him again at '' ticonderoga '' , a place name that was unknown to him at the time 168 william pitt , the british secretary of state who had designed the british military strategy and received word of the defeat in august , wrote to abercrombie on september 18 that the '' king has judged proper that you should return to england 51 beginning on the evening of july 6 , the french began to lay out entrenchments on the rise northwest of the fort , about away , that commanded the land routes to the fort 134 nicolas sarrebource de pontleroy , montcalm 's chief engineer , said of the fort 's site , '' were i to be entrusted with the siege of it , i should require only six mortars and two cannon 108 when word reached bourlamaque on july 5 that the british fleet was coming , he sent captain trépezet and about 350 & nbsp ; men to observe the fleet , and , if possible , to prevent their landing he commanded the royal roussillon and berry battalions in the center of the entrenchments , while lévis commanded the béarn , guyenne , and la reine battalions on the right , and bourlamaque led the la sarre and languedoc battalions on the left more than 300 men ( including 8 officers ) were killed , and a similar number were wounded , representing a significant fraction of the total casualties suffered by the british 159 was reported by his aide , james abercrombie , to be near the rear of the lines by the la chute river during much of the battle , nester , p abercrombie ordered his engineer , lieutenant matthew clerk , and one of his aides , captain james abercrombie ( it is uncertain if the abercrombies were related or not ) to reconnoiter the french defenses writing in his own defense , he later claimed that he was relying on clerk 's assessment that the works could be easily taken ; this was clearly refuted by the failure of the first charge to the west was a low rise of land , beyond which lay mount hope , a rise that commanded part of the portage trail , but was too far from the fort to pose it any danger the bulk of the army landed , formed into columns , and attempted to march up the west side of the stream that connected lake george to lake champlain , rather than along the portage trail , whose bridges montcalm had destroyed quebecemblems the banner , now known as the flag of carillon , dates back to the 17th century , confirmed by textile expert jean-michel tuchscherer : '' the flag is without doubt an exceptional piece of document from the 17th century '' 145 what is clear is that abercrombie , in his stated desire for haste , did not want to act on clerk 's recommendation to fortify rattlesnake hill , and then sought to blame clerk , claiming he was merely acting on the engineer 's advice while montcalm performed well during the battle , some tactical options escaped his notice , and some of his actions in preparing the defenses at carillon are open to question image : carillonbattlesmall.png right thumb 240px schematic map depicting the battle lines ( click for zoomable image ) desc none default the battle began on the morning of july 8 with rogers ' rangers and light infantry from colonel thomas gage 's 80th regiment of light-armed foot pushing the few remaining french scouts behind
