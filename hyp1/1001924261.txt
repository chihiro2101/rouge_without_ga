despite the commercial failure of '' ai n't it hard '' , reprise records was encouraged by the group 's effort , and signed the band to a recording contract that left them under hassinger 's authority in europe , the band 's albums were re-released , with 1986 seeing the reissue of underground , release of an oath , and , essentially the electric prunes 's first greatest hits album , long days flight nonetheless , hassinger still owned the rights to the electric prunes 's name , and was encouraged by the success of mass in f minor , which prompted him to assemble a new line-up '' the fluttering buzz sound was utilized for the opening to the tucker-mantz song , '' i had too much to dream ( last night ) '' , which also included a heavily-textured psychedelic guitar motif the song , which featured williams playing a prototype steel guitar , and childlike to maddening vocals , was described by music historian richie unterberger as '' sounding more like a horror movie theme run amok than a radio-ready hit '' , and consequently the single bubbled under the hot 100 at number 128 in august 2002 , the group toured europe for the first time since 1968 , with concerts in the uk and greece and , in 2003 , a dvd looking into the uk portion of their european tour , called rewired , was released the band 's follow-up single , '' get me to the world on time '' , which put distorted sound effects to a psychedelic-tinged bo diddley beat , was released in may 1967
