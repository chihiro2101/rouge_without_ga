of particular interest to a transit server are : message-id - a globally unique key newsgroups - a list of one or more newsgroups where the article is intended to appear distribution - ( optional ) a supplement to newsgroups , used to restrict circulation of articles a reader server typically also works as a transit server , but it may operate independently or serve as an alternative interface to an internet forum this generally means that a server can run with less overhead which makes for a more efficient server , but gives less articles for users to access to deal with the increase of usenet traffic , many providers turn to a hybrid system , in which old articles not found on the provider 's server will request the article from another server with longer retention if the article is posted to a moderated group , the server will attempt to mail it to the newsgroup moderator if the approved header is absent end users often use the term '' posting '' to refer to a single message or file posted to usenet a reader server provides an interface to read and post articles , generally with the assistance of a news client each news article contains a complete set of header lines , but in common use the term '' headers '' is also used when referring to the news overview database the server that the user connects to is typically part of a server farm that has many servers dedicated to multiple tasks this is a particular problem to binary newsgroups which transmit large volumes of articles it can be difficult for end users to accurately measure the retention of a server one way to measure completion is to access multiple servers and retrieve lists of articles the newgroup and rmgroup commands can cause newsgroups to be created or removed ; checkgroups can be used to reconcile the local active list with a commonly accepted set ; and cancel commands are used to request the deletion of a specific article it is also necessary to take into account propagation times and retention ; an article may simply have not yet arrived at a given server , or it may have been present but already expired a reader server is one that makes the articles available in the hierarchical disk directory format originated by b news 2.10 , or offers the nntp or imap commands , for use by newsreaders its performance capability is a direct function of the underlying operating system 's ability to create , remove and locate files within a directory , and often this scheme is insufficient to keep up with modern usenet traffic speed , in relation to usenet , is how quickly a server can deliver an article to the user they may also be the only available means to obtain articles from remote servers that do not offer conventional feeding omicron 's hw media is currently the usenet server with the highest amount of binary retention , while google is the usenet server with the highest amount of text retention completion ( the ability of a server to successfully receive all traffic ) , retention ( the amount of time articles are made available to readers ) and overall system performance a sampling of many or all articles , preferably in more than one newsgroup , is required to detect such anomalies retention is generally quoted separately for text and binary articles , though it may also vary between different groups within these categories articles may never make their way outside the originating server , or may fail to find their way out to the transit cloud due to the large amount of data in a full binary+text usenet feed ( can be high as 30 terabytes a day ) and the high costs of transmitting that data through an ip transit provider like cogent , telia , or zayo , most usenet providers will only engage in binary peering when they are interconnected at an internet exchange like ams-ix , six , or decix news servers do not have unlimited storage , and due to this fact they can only hold posts for a length of time before they must delete them in order to make room for new posts
