a major task taken on by dennett in elbow room is to clearly describe just what people are as biology entities and why they find the issue of free will to be of significance given the chance to repeat some futile behavior endlessly , people can notice the futility of it , and by an act of free will do something else how do we reconcile our feeling of free will with the idea that we might be mechanics components of a mechanical universe ? what about determinism ? when we say that a person chooses among several possible behaviors is there really a choice or does it just seem like there is a choice ? do people just ( through the action of their more complex brains ) simply have better behaviors than wasps , while still being totally mechanical in executing those behaviors ? dennett gives his definition of determinism on page one : all physical events are caused or determined by the sum total of all previous events this definition dodges a question that many people feel should not be dodged : if we repeatedly replayed the universe from the same point in time would it always reach the same future ? since we have no way of performing this experiment , this question is a long-term classic in philosophy and physicists have tried to interpret the results of other experiments in various ways in order to figure out the answer to this question what the physicists seem to be trying to construct is a type of free will that involves a way for brains to make use of quantum indeterminacy so as to make choices that alter the universe in our favor , or if there are multiple universes , to choose among the possible universes dennett suggests that we can have another kind of free will , a type of free will which we can be perfectly happy with even if it does not give us the power to act in more than one way at any given time the type of free will that dennett thinks we have is finally stated clearly in the last chapter of the book : the power to be active agents , biological devices that respond to our environment with rational , desirable courses of action if our hypothetically mechanical brains are in control of our behavior and our brains produce good behaviors for us , then do we really need such choice ? is an illusion of behavioral choices just as good as actual choices ? is our sensation of having the freedom to execute more than one behavior at a given time really just an illusion ? dennett argues that choice exists in a general sense : that because we base our decisions on context , we limit our options as the situation becomes more specific : '' it is this contrast between the stable and the chaotic that grounds our division of the world into the enduring and salient features of the world , and those features that we must treat statistically or probabilistically if people are determined to act as they do , then what about personal responsibility ? how can we hold people responsible and punish them for their behaviors if they have no choice in how they behave ? dennett gives a two-part answer to this question : first , we hold people responsible for their actions because we know from historical experience that this is an effective means to make people behave in a socially acceptable way is it , then , moral to punish people who are unable to do other than break a rule ? yes , people have the right to come together and improve their condition by creating rules and enforcing them one final issue : if people do not have real behavioral choices , why not collapse into fatalism ? again , dennett 's argument is that we may not have behavioral choice , but we do have control of our behavior dennett asks us to look around at the universe and ask , can i even conceive of beings whose will is freer than our own ? for dennett , the answer to this question is , no , not really in elbow room , he tries to explain why all the attempts that people have made to prove that people have libertarian choice have failed and are , in the final analysis , not really important anyhow dennett , daniel , elbow room : the varieties of free will worth wanting , 1984
