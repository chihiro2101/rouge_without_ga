despite initial intentions on the part of reformers to create a written language that closely mirrors the colloquial mandarin dialects and to expunge classical influences from the language for the sake of modernization , it became clear to users of the new written standard that the admixture of a certain proportion of classical ( wenyanwen ) grammatical constructions and vocabulary into baihuawen was unavoidable and serves as an important means of conveying tone and register similarly , until the end of the 20th century , men of letters , especially in the republic of china ( taiwan ) , exchanged personal letters ( known as 尺牘 ) using classical chinese stock phrases for openings , greetings , and closings , and using vernacular chinese ( albeit heavily influenced by the classical language ) for the body by the time of the tang and song dynasties ( 618–1279 ) , people began to write in their vernacular dialects in the form of bianwen and yǔlù , and the spoken language was completely distinct from the still-maintained written standard of classical chinese ( wenyanwen ) presently , the ability to read some classical chinese is taught throughout mainland china ( in simplified orthography ) and taiwan , hong kong and macau ( in traditional orthography ) as part of compulsory primary and secondary education , with the reading of tang poetry taught starting from elementary school and classical prose taught throughout lower and upper secondary schools however , it was not until after the may fourth movement in 1919 and the promotion by scholars and intellectuals such as pragmatist reformer hu shih , pioneering writer chen hengzhe , leftist lu xun , chen duxiu , and leftist qian xuantong that vernacular chinese , or bai hua , gained widespread importance while the phonology of modern standard chinese is based on that of beijing , its grammar is officially based on the exemplary works of vernacular literature , which excludes certain colloquial or 'extreme ' forms while incorporating some constructions from classical chinese ( see below ) until the 1970s , the legal code of the republic of china was written in classical chinese , though in a form replete with modern expressions and constructions that would have been foreign to ancient writers during the zhou dynasty ( 1046–256 bc ) , old chinese was the spoken and written form of chinese , and was used to write classical chinese texts along with the growing popularity of vernacular writing in books in this period was the acceptance of punctuation , modeled after that used in western languages ( traditional chinese literature was almost entirely unpunctuated ) , and the use of arabic numerals during the ming and qing ( 1368–1912 ) , vernacular language began to be used in novels , but formal writing continued to use classical chinese
