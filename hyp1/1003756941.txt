with the coalition forces now in full retreat , marmont received orders to aggressively pursue the enemy , knowing that he could count on his two infantry divisions , plus that of leval , as well as on the support of general drouot 's guard artillery , on nansouty 's guard cavalry on his right and on grouchy 's two cavalry divisions on his left during the battle of vauchamps on 14 february , prussian field-marshal gebhard leberecht von blücher , commander of the combined prusso-russian army of silesia could count on 20,000 to 21,500 men , from three army corps : a prussian brigade comprised several regiments and was roughly equivalent in strength to a french or russian division however , of these men , only 19,000 soldiers got to the battlefield in time , with no more than 10,000 men engaged in the actual fighting : vi corps , commanded by marshal of the empire auguste de marmont : 3rd division under joseph lagrange 8th division under étienne pierre sylvestre ricard reinforcements temporarily attached : 7th division under jean françois leval cavalry , commanded by general emmanuel de grouchy : division antoine louis decrest de saint-germain division jean-pierre doumerc division étienne tardif de pommeroux de bordesoulle guard cavalry , commanded by general etienne de nansouty : 2nd division under charles , comte lefebvre-desnouettes , 3rd division under louis marie levesque de laferrière with now both brigades of ricard 's division available , marmont launched these men against the prussian position at vauchamps , with the 1st brigade on his right , advancing under the cover of the beaumont forest , south of the montmirail-vauchamps road and the 2nd brigade on his left , north of the road , advancing frontally towards the position abandoning his position at fromentières , where marmont 's infantry had just begun to irrupt , blücher ordered the continuation of the retreat towards champaubert and étoges , with kleist 's corps on the left , south of the road and kaptzevitch 's corps on the right , north of the road meanwhile , late on 13 february , having successfully regrouped what forces he could muster at bergères-lès-vertus , blücher had launched an attack against marmont 's single division , pushing him out of étoges and advancing as planned towards champaubert and fromentières , in the rear of napoleon 's force marmont was now supported on his left by general grouchy , who had just arrived on the field of battle with the divisions of saint-germain and doumerc , moving past the village of janvilliers , in order to cut off zieten 's retreat still in pursuit of the debris of the enemy force , late on 13 february , napoleon received reports that marmont 's corps had been attacked and pushed out of his position at étoges again taking advantage from the flat terrain , grouchy was able to advance rapidly and fall onto the rear of the coalition infantry squares , which were now slowly withdrawing in echelon and efficiently using the terrain to take shelter from the artillery bombardment the emperor left château-thierry on 14 february , towards 3 o'clock in the morning , leaving a small portion of his forces with marshal édouard mortier , duc de trévise , with orders to continue the pursuit of the enemy however , once past these villages , the terrain became flat and even , proper for cavalry action , and now , with the increasingly aggressive action of the enemy cavalry against his flank and rear , zieten and his brigade became increasingly isolated grouchy , with the divisions of doumerc and saint-germain was now boldly menacing zieten 's right , while on his left , the prussian general saw nansouty 's guard cavalry ( laferrière-levesque 's division , plus the four service squadrons , under lefebvre-desnouettes ) after his consecutive defeats , field-marshal blücher decided to disengage from napoleon and move a significant force against the isolated french army corps of marshal marmont , at étoges having begun to push back the feeble french forces from marmont 's vi 's corps the day before , blücher occupied champaubert early on 14 february , sending his vanguard forward , as far as the village of fromentières and then vauchamps spotting this weakness , grouchy , who had been reinforced by bordesoulle 's division , energetically launched his three divisions against the coalition squares , dispersing a number of them , with these men fleeing in disorder to take refuge in the étoges forest since pigeard asserts that these casualties occurred during the pursuit , it is possible that these figures do not take into account the casualties incurred during the initial actions of this battle ( one battalion of zieten 's brigade captured , plus the 2,000 prisoners taken during grouchy 's and nansouty 's joint action against zieten )
