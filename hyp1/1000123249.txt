the destructive action on the nervous tissue and the mass effect produced by a large number of eggs surrounded by multiple , large granulomas in circumscribed areas of the brain characterize the pseudotumoral form of neuroschistosomiasis and are responsible for the appearance of clinical manifestations : headache , hemiparesis , altered mental status , vertigo , visual abnormalities , seizures , and ataxia the morbidity control strategy focused on synchronous chemotherapy for humans and bovines and the new strategy developed in 2004 intervenes in the transmission pathway of schistosomiasis , mainly including replacement of bovines with machines , prohibition of grazing cattle in the grasslands , improving sanitation , installation of fecal-matter containers on boats , praziquantel drug therapy , snail control , and health education the who has developed guidelines for community treatment based on the impact the disease has on children in villages in which it is common : when a village reports more than 50 percent of children have blood in their urine , everyone in the village receives treatment eggs can also become lodged in the liver , leading to portal hypertension , splenomegaly , the buildup of fluid in the abdomen , and potentially life-threatening dilations or swollen areas in the esophagus or gastrointestinal tract that can tear and bleed profusely ( esophageal varices ) in 2005 , a field evaluation of a novel handheld microscope was undertaken in uganda for the diagnosis of intestinal schistosomiasis by a team led by russell stothard from the natural history museum of london , working with the schistosomiasis control initiative , london symptoms include : dry cough with changes on chest x-ray fever fatigue myalgia malaise abdominal pain enlargement of both the liver and the spleen the symptoms usually get better on their own , but a small proportion of people have persistent weight loss , diarrhea , diffuse abdominal pain , and rash antibody detection can be useful to indicate schistosome infection in people who have traveled to areas where schistosomiasis is common and in whom eggs can not be demonstrated in fecal or urine specimens an estimated 600 to 700 million people worldwide are at risk from the disease because they live in countries where the organism is common the disease is found in tropics countries in africa , the caribbean , eastern south america , southeast asia , and the middle east however , it is not frequently used in countries where the disease is common due to the cost of the equipment and the technical expertise required to run the tests while transmission typically occurs only in countries where the freshwater snails are endemic , a case in germany was reported where a man got schistosoma by an infected snail in his aquarium from ancient times to the early 20th century , schistosomiasis ' symptom of blood in the urine was seen as a male menstruation in egypt and was thus viewed as a rite of passage for boys test sensitivity and specificity vary widely among the many tests reported for the serologic diagnosis of schistosomiasis and are dependent on both the type of antigen preparations used ( crude , purified , adult worm , egg , cercarial ) and the test procedure schistosomiasis is known as bilharzia or bilharziosis in many countries , after german physician theodor bilharz , who first described the cause of urinary schistosomiasis in 1851 the risk of bladder cancer appears to be especially high in male smokers , perhaps due to chronic irritation of the bladder lining allowing it to be exposed to carcinogens from smoking the treatment objective is to cure the disease and to prevent the evolution of the acute to the chronic form of the disease irrigation schemes can be designed to make it hard for the snails to colonize the water and to reduce the contact with the local population within 12 hours of infection , an individual may complain of a tingling sensation or light rash , commonly referred to as '' swimmer 's itch '' , due to irritation at the point of entrance the centers for disease control and prevention advises avoiding drinking or coming into contact with contaminated water in areas where schistosomiasis is common among human parasitic diseases , schistosomiasis ranks second behind malaria in terms of socio-economic and public health importance in tropical and subtropical areas another primary condition , called katayama fever , may also develop from infection with these worms , and it can be very difficult to recognize bladder cancer diagnosis and mortality are generally elevated in affected areas ; efforts to control schistosomiasis in egypt have led to decreases in the bladder cancer rate 93-124 , it is responsible for 32 million cases of dysuria , 10 million cases of hydronephrosis , and 150,000 deaths from kidney failure annually , making s worldwide , the global burden of disease study issued in 2010 estimated 12,000 direct deaths while the who in 2014 estimated more than 200,000 annual deaths related to schistosomiasis acute schistosomiasis ( katayama fever ) may occur weeks or months after the initial infection as a systemic reaction against migrating schistosomulae as they pass through the bloodstream through the lungs to the liver in addition , for field surveys and investigational purposes , the egg output can be quantified by using the kato-katz technique ( 20 to 50 & nbsp ; mg of fecal material ) or the ritchie technique the drug praziquantel is used for prevention in high-risk populations living in areas where the disease is common this likely makes it the most common parasitic infection with malaria second and causing about 207 million cases in 2013 other symptoms can occur 2â€“10 weeks later and can include fever , aching , a cough , diarrhea , chills , or gland enlargement because of praziquantel 's lower cost per treatment , and oxaminiquine 's lack of efficacy against the urogenital form of the disease caused by s the enzymes also cause an eosinophilic inflammatory reaction when eggs get trapped in tissues or embolize to the liver , spleen , lungs , or brain eggs also migrate to the liver leading to fibrosis in 4 to 8 % of people with chronic infection , mainly those with long-term heavy infection in some cases , urbanization , pollution , and the consequent destruction of snail habitat have reduced exposure , with a subsequent decrease in new infections in china , the national strategy for schistosomiasis control has shifted three times since it was first initiated : transmission control strategy ( from mid-1950s to early 1980s ) , morbidity control strategy ( from mid-1980s to 2003 ) , and the '' new integrated strategy '' ( 2004 to present ) humans encounter larvae of the schistosoma parasite when they enter contaminated water while bathing , playing , swimming , washing , fishing , or walking through the water if the eggs do not get excreted , they can become engrained in the body tissues and cause a variety of problems such as immune reactions and organ damage the presence of antibody is indicative only of schistosome infection at some time and can not be correlated with clinical status , worm burden , egg production , or prognosis
