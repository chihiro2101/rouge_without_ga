a romance , which was submitted to chapman and hall but rejected in 1845 armadale , the first and only one of collins 's major novels of the 1860s to be serialised in a magazine other than all the year round , provoked strong criticism the woman in white and the moonstone share an unusual narrative structure , somewhat resembling an epistolary novel , in which different portions of the book have different narrators , each with a distinct narrative voice collins said of it : '' my youthful imagination ran riot among the noble savages , in scenes which caused the respectable british publisher to declare that it was impossible to put his name on the title page of such a novel in 1864 , he began work on his novel armadale , travelling in august to the the broads and the village of winterton-on-sea do research for it during this period collins extended the variety of his writing , publishing articles in george henry lewes 's paper the leader , short stories and essays for bentley 's miscellany , as well as dramatic criticism and the travel book rambles beyond railways his play no thoroughfare , co-written with dickens , was published as the 1867 christmas number of all the year round and dramatised at the adelphi theatre on 26 december his later novels include jezebel 's daughter ( 1880 ) , the black robe ( 1881 ) , heart and science ( 1883 ) , and the evil genius ( 1886 ) his next novel , no name combined social commentary – the absurdity of the law as applied to children of unmarried parents ( see illegitimacy in fiction ) – with a densely plotted revenge thriller there was an amateur production with palgrave simpson on 3 may 1865 at the royal bijou theatre ( lambeth school of art ) and further revivals at shelley 's boscombe theatre in the 1870s and 1880s when he was with martha , collins assumed the name william dawson , and she and their children used the last name of dawson themselves in 1868 , collins met martha rudd in winterton-on-sea in norfolk , and the two began a liaison by that time collins was having difficulty controlling the amount of laudanum he was taking for his continual gout and became addicted collins lived close to the small shop kept by caroline , and the two may have met in the neighborhood in the mid–1850s after his father 's death in 1847 , collins produced his first published book , memoirs of the life of william collins , esq his rising success as a writer allowed collins to resign his post with all the year round in 1862 and focus on his novels
