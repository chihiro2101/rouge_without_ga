when edwin was killed in about 632 , æthelburg , escorted by paulinus , fled by sea to eadbald 's court in kent , but in a further sign of her family 's ties across the channel she sent her children to the court of king dagobert i of the franks , to keep them safe from the intrigues of eadbald and oswald of northumbria he then remarried , and his second wife , according to kentish tradition recorded in the 'kentish royal legend ' , was a woman named ymme of frankish royal blood , though recently it has been suggested that she may have instead been the daughter of erchinoald , mayor of the palace in neustria , the western part of francia it also appears that the letter to justus was written after the letters to edwin and æthelburg , rather than before , as bede has it ; boniface 's letter to edwin and æthelburg indicates he had the news from messengers , but when he wrote to justus he had heard from the king himself the name of æthelberht 's second wife is not recorded , but it seems likely that she was a pagan , since on his death she married eadbald , her stepson : a marriage between a stepmother and stepson was forbidden by the church the pallium accompanying that letter indicates justus was archbishop by that time , and the duration of mellitus 's archiepiscopate means that even if bede 's dates are somewhat wrong in other particulars , eadbald was converted no earlier than 621 , and no later than april 624 , since mellitus consecrated a church for eadbald before his death in that month barbara yorke , kent , kings of , oxford online dictionary of national biography , 2004 it is known that æthelberht married twice as eadbald married his step-mother after his father 's death , to the consternation of the church in the 620s , eadbald 's sister æthelburg came to kent , but sent her children to the court of king dagobert i in francia ; in addition to the diplomatic connections , trade with the franks was important to kent another factor in edwin 's treatment of kent may have been the location of the archbishopric in canterbury : edwin was well aware of the importance of canterbury 's metropolitan status , and at one time planned to make york an archbishopric too , with paulinus as the planned first incumbent it is possible that there was another brother , named æthelwald : the evidence for this is a papal letter to justus , archbishop of canterbury from 619 to 625 , in which a king named aduluald is referred to , and who is apparently different from audubald , which refers to eadbald the surviving regnal lists show only one king reigning at a time in kent , but subkingdoms were common among the anglo-saxons and from the reign of hlothhere , in the late seventh century , there is evidence that kent was usually ruled by two kings , though often one is clearly dominant sæberht , the king of essex , had become a christian under æthelberht 's influence , but on sæberht 's death , at about the same time , his sons expelled mellitus , the bishop of london this is quite inconsistent with the earlier date bede gives for eadbald 's acceptance of christianity , and it has been suggested in bede 's defence that æthelburg married edwin substantially earlier and stayed in kent until 625 before travelling to rome , and that the letter was written while she was in kent the papal letter that has been interpreted as indicating the existence of æthelwald , a brother of eadbald 's , refers to æthelwald as a king ; if he existed , he would presumably have been a junior king to eadbald in this view , bede has conflated the letter conveying the pallium with the letter congratulating justus on the conversion , which according to bede 's account was seven or so years earlier ; however , the grammatical details on which this suggestion is based are not unique to this letter , and as a result it is usually considered to be a single composition eadbald and ymme had a daughter , eanswith ( who founded the very first nunnery on english soil at folkestone , 15 miles from canterbury ) , and two sons , eorcenberht and eormenred the archaeological evidence , combined with the known political division into two kingdoms , makes it likely that the origin of the subkingdoms was the conquest of the western half by the eastern , which would have been the first area settled by the invaders within a year of edwin 's death in 633 or 634 , oswald took the throne of northumbria , and it seems likely that his relations with eadbald were modelled on edwin 's there is archaeological evidence that suggests that the royal influence predates any of the written sources , and it may have been eadbald 's father , æthelberht , who took control of trade away from the aristocracy and made it a royal monopoly kelly , æthelberht i , oxford online dictionary of national biography , 2004 eadbald had a sister , æthelburg , who was probably also the child of bertha it has also been suggested that the pallium did not indicate justus was archbishop , since justus is told the limited circumstances in which he may wear it ; however , the same phrasing occurs in the letter conveying the pallium to archbishop augustine , also quoted in bede 624 : after justus 's succession , pope boniface writes to him to say that he has heard in letters from king aduluald ( possibly a scribal error for eadbald ) of the king 's conversion to christianity eadbald 's reduced power is apparent in his inability to restore mellitus to the see of london : in bede 's words , his authority in essex '' was not so effective as that of his father '' the story of æthelburg 's marriage being dependent on edwin allowing her to practice her faith has been questioned , since revising the chronology makes it likely , though not certain , that the marriage was arranged before eadbald 's conversion eadbald 's second wife , ymme , was a frank , and it is possible that kent 's strong connections with francia were a factor in the king 's conversion king anna of east anglia married his daughter , seaxburh , to eorcenberht , and their daughter eormenhild married wulfhere of mercia , one of the most powerful kings of his day the relationship would have been valuable to eadbald , too ; it may have been as a result of this alliance that edwin 's overlordship of britain did not include kent this dominance led to wealth in the form of tribute , and kent was a powerful kingdom at the time of æthelberht 's death in 616 , with trade well-established with the europe oswald 's successor , oswiu , married eanflæd , who was edwin 's daughter and eadbald 's niece , thereby gaining both deiran and kentish connections eormenred was the older of the two , and may have held the title of regulus , perhaps implying that he held the junior kingship of kent there is no agreement among modern scholars on how to interpret this : '' aduluald '' might be intended as a representation of '' æthelwald '' , and hence this may be an indication of another king , perhaps a subking of west kent ; yorke , kings and kingdoms , pp 616/617 : some time after mellitus and justus depart , laurence , the archbishop of canterbury , plans to leave for francia but has a vision in which st peter scourges him according to bede , eadbald was punished for his faithlessness by '' frequent fits of insanity '' , and possession by an '' evil spirit '' ( perhaps referring to epileptic fits ) , yorke , kings and kingdoms , p kirby points out that boniface 's letter to æthelburg makes it clear that the news of eadbald 's conversion is recent , and that it is unthinkable that boniface would not have been kept up to date on the status of eadbald 's conversion left the ancestry of æthelberht , eadbald 's father , is given by bede , who states that he was descended from the legendary founder of kent , hengist as mentioned above , it has been suggested that king '' aduluald '' in the letter to justus is a real king æthelwald , perhaps a junior king of west kent however , an early text ( caligula a.xiv ) refers to eormenred as 'king ' , suggesting either he was a junior king under eorcenberht , or had a shared kingship the story of paulinus 's consecration is also problematic as he was not consecrated until at least 625 and possibly later , which is after the latest possible date for æthelburg 's marriage
