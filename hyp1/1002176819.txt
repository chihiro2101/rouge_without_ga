parasympathetic nerve supply arises through three primary areas : certain cranial nerves in the cranium , namely the preganglionic parasympathetic nerves ( cn iii , cn vii , cn ix and cn x ) usually arise from specific nuclei in the central nervous system ( cns ) and synapse at one of four parasympathetic ganglia : ciliary , pterygopalatine , otic , or submandibular assuming that the reported findings most likely applies to other mammals as well , this perspective suggests a simplified , bipartite architecture of the autonomic nervous system , in which the parasympathetic nervous system receives input from cranial nerves exclusively and the sympathetic nervous system from thoracic to sacral spinal nerves the vagus nerve does not participate in these cranial ganglia as most of its parasympathetic fibers are destined for a broad array of ganglia on or near thoracic viscera ( esophagus , trachea , heart , lungs ) and abdominal viscera ( stomach , pancreas , liver , kidneys , small intestine , and about half of the large intestine ) the m2 muscarinic receptors are located in the heart , and act to bring the heart back to normal after the actions of the sympathetic nervous system : slowing down the heart rate , reducing contractile forces of the atrial cardiac muscle , and reducing conduction velocity of the sinoatrial node and atrioventricular node the preganglionic fibers originate within the cns in the superior salivatory nucleus and leave as the intermediate nerve ( which some consider a separate cranial nerve altogether ) to connect with the facial nerve just distal ( further out ) to it surfacing the central nervous system the afferent fibers of the autonomic nervous system , which transmit sensory information from the internal organs of the body back to the central nervous system , are not divided into parasympathetic and sympathetic fibers as the efferent fibers are the short ciliary nerves innervate the orbit to control the ciliary muscle ( responsible for accommodation ) and the iris sphincter muscle , which is responsible for miosis or constriction of the pupil ( in response to light or accommodation ) the vagus nerve , named after the latin word vagus ( because the nerve controls such a broad range of target tissues – vagus in latin literally means '' wandering '' ) , has parasympathetic functions that originate in the dorsal nucleus of the vagus nerve and the nucleus ambiguus in the cns a useful mnemonic to summarize the functions of the parasympathetic nervous system is ssludd ( sexual arousal , salivation , tears , urination , digestion and defecation ) yet another set of divisions from the pterygopalatine ganglion are the posterior , superior , and inferior lateral nasal nerves ; and the nasopalatine nerves ( all branches of cn v 2 , maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve ) that bring parasympathetic innervation to glands of the nasal mucosa from the left vagus nerve the recurrent laryngeal nerve hooks around the aorta to travel back up to the larynx and proximal esophagus while , from the right vagus nerve , the recurrent laryngeal nerve hooks around the right subclavian artery to travel back up to the same location as its counterpart the pelvic splanchnic nerves reside in the lateral gray horn of the spinal cord at the t12-l1 vertebral levels ( the spinal cord terminates at the l1-l2 vertebrae with the conus medullaris ) , and their axons exit the vertebral column as s2-s4 spinal nerves through the sacral foramina in males , the cavernous nerves from the prostatic plexus stimulate smooth muscles in the fibrous trabeculae of the coiled helicine arteries of penis to relax and allow blood to fill the two corpora cavernosa and the corpus spongiosum of the penis , making it rigid to prepare for sexual activity unconsciously , the parasympathetic will cause peristaltic movements of the ureters and intestines , moving urine from the kidneys into the bladder and food down the intestinal tract and , upon necessity , the parasympathetic will assist in excreting urine from the bladder or defecation the parasympathetic fibers of the nerve of the pterygoid canal synapse at the pterygopalatine ganglion , which is closely associated with the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve ( cn v 2 ) the visceral tissues in the pelvis that the parasympathetic nerve pathway controls include those of the urinary bladder , ureters , urinary sphincter , anal sphincter , uterus , prostate , glands , vagina , and penis parasympathetic action helps in digestion and absorption of food by increasing the activity of the intestinal musculature , increasing gastric secretion , and relaxing the pyloric sphincter.it is called the “ rest and digest ” division of the ans unlike in the cranium , where one parasympathetic is in charge of one particular tissue or region , for the most part the pelvic splanchnics each contribute fibers to pelvic viscera by traveling to one or more plexuses before being dispersed to the target tissue as in the sympathetic nervous system , efferent parasympathetic nerve signals are carried from the central nervous system to their targets by a system of two neurons the parasympathetic aspect of the facial nerve controls secretion of the sublingual and submandibular salivary glands , the lacrimal gland , and the glands associated with the nasal cavity at the same time , parasympathetics cause peristalsis of the urethral muscle , and the pudendal nerve causes contraction of the bulbospongiosus ( skeletal muscle is not via pn ) , to forcibly emit the semen from the ciliary ganglion the postganglionic parasympathetic fibers leave via short ciliary nerve fibers , a continuation of the nasociliary nerve ( a branch of ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve ( cn v 1 ) ) its cell body sits in the central nervous system and its axon usually extends to synapse with the dendrites of a postganglionic neuron somewhere else in the body these plexuses are composed of mixed autonomic nerve fibers ( parasympathetic and sympathetic ) and include the vesical , prostatic , rectal , uterovaginal , and inferior hypogastric plexuses the oculomotor pns fibers originate in the edinger-westphal nucleus in the central nervous system and travel through the superior orbital fissure to synapse in the ciliary ganglion located just behind the orbit ( eye ) stimulation of the parasympathetic will cause the detrusor muscle ( urinary bladder wall ) to contract and simultaneously relax the internal sphincter muscle between the bladder and the urethra , allowing the bladder to void
