however , the seam on a cricket ball is equatorial , and thus the extent of erratic movement is reduced due to the symmetry ( at least in the conventional release position where the planes of the ball 's trajectory and the seam are nearly co-planar ) the ball completes between one-quarter and one-half a rotation on its way from the pitcher to the batter ; the position of the stitches changes as the ball travels , affecting the drag that gives the ball its motion , thus making its flight erratic in association football or soccer , the method of striking the ball so that it produces almost no spinning motion during its flight has been colloquially described as '' knuckleballing '' by commentators , due to the ball 's motion that resembles a baseball thrown with a knuckleball pitch in baseball terminology the pitcher and catcher together are known as a '' battery '' , and having a catcher experienced in catching a knuckleball pitcher is preferable , so the trade of pitcher and catcher together is sometimes referred to as a '' batteries included '' trade toad ramsey , a pitcher from 1885 to 1890 , is credited in some later sources with being the first knuckleballer , apparently based primarily on accounts of how he gripped the ball ; however , based on more contemporary descriptions of his pitch as an '' immense drop ball '' , it may be that his pitch was a form of knuckle curve indeed , bouton 's famous best-selling book ball four ( 1970 ) , while scandalous at the time for its unvarnished and often uncomplimentary portrayal of player behavior and coaching small-mindedness , is primarily a tale of the ups and downs of trying to hang on in the major leagues as a knuckleball pitcher for a catcher , a key disadvantage to using a first baseman 's glove mitt is that they are not designed for easy extraction of the ball from the glove , making it harder to prevent baserunners from stealing as with hitters , the unpredictable motion of the knuckleball makes it one of the most difficult pitches for catchers to handle , and they tend to be charged with a significantly higher number of passed balls however , since a typical major league starting rotation exceeds the length of a series against any one opponent , one way a manager can mitigate this disadvantage is to adjust his team 's pitching rotation so as to eliminate ( or at least minimize ) games in which a knuckleballer would pitch against teams with a preponderance of fast baserunners to reduce the chances of having the knuckleball get hit for a home run , some pitchers will impart a slight topspin so that if no force causes the ball to dance , it will move downward in flight ( a common phrase for hitting a knuckleball is '' if it 's low , let it go ; if it 's high , let it fly '' ; meaning that a batter should attempt to hit a knuckleball only if it crosses the plate high in the strike zone due to lack of break perhaps as a result , knuckleball pitchers often view themselves as members of an exclusive club , with its own uniform number ( 49 , first worn by wilhelm ) and leader ( phil niekro , whom the new yorker in 2004 called '' the undisputed grand poobah '' of the group after wilhelm 's death ) these include the flutterball , the floater , the dancer , the butterfly ball ( the name for the pitch used by french language game commentators employed by the montreal expos ) , the ghostball , and the bug the knuckle curve has a somewhat similar name because of the grip used to throw it ( also with the knuckles or fingernails ) , but it is generally thrown harder and with spin over the distance from the pitcher 's mound to home plate , the effect of these forces is that the knuckleball can flutter , dance , jiggle , or curve in two different directions during its flight knuckleball headquarters – comprehensive collection of information about the pitch and those who have thrown it the ( mostly ) complete list of knuckleball pitchers – a list of just about everyone who 's thrown the pitch in the major leagues , with links to each player 's career stats during the 1945 season , with talent depleted by call-ups to fight in world war ii , the washington senators had a pitching rotation which included four knuckleball pitchers ( dutch leonard , johnny niggeling , mickey haefner , and roger wolff ) who combined for 60 complete games and 60 wins , carrying the senators to second place cicotte was widely reported to throw both the knuckleball and a variant on the spitball known as a '' shine ball '' ( because he would '' shine '' one side of a dirty ball by rubbing it on his uniform ) it is for this reason that the knuckleball is widely regarded as unreliable , and knuckleball pitchers are prone to extended slumps , such as when tim wakefield was released from the pirates in a mid-career slump during spring training in 1995 dickey became the first cy young award-winning knuckleball pitcher , he called the award '' a victory for … the knuckleball fraternity '' , and of the dozens of phone calls he received after the announcement , niekro 's was the only one he answered image : wakefield throws a knuckleball.jpg thumb right 267px tim wakefield in his throwing motion , showing his grip of the knuckleball since it developed during a period when the spitball was legal and commonly used , and was similarly surprising in its motion , the knuckleball was sometimes called the '' dry spitter '' because the speed of any prospect 's pitch is one of the quickest and easiest metrics in judging the skill of the prospect , the knuckleball , which is thrown slower than any other pitch , gets overlooked it is almost never used in a mixed repertoire today , however , and some believe that to throw the knuckleball effectively with some semblance of control over the pitch , one must throw it more or less exclusively one of the main proponents of this shooting technique was brazilian playmaker juninho pernambucano , who popularised it in particular during his time with lyon in the mid 2000s ; however , it is commonly thought to have been invented by compatriot didi , '' kings of the free-kick '' former catcher bob uecker , who caught for phil niekro , said , '' the way to catch a knuckleball is to wait until it stops rolling and pick it up however , cicotte called the shine ball '' a pure freak of the imagination '' , claiming that he did this to disconcert hitters and that the pitch was still a knuckleball
