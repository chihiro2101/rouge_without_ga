vertical take-off and landing ( vtol ) aircraft include fixed-wing aircraft that can hover , take off and land vertically as well as helicopters and other aircraft with powered rotors , such as tiltrotors for a given aircraft , the takeoff speed is usually dependent on the aircraft weight ; the heavier the weight , the greater the speed needed in most such aircraft , any engine failure results in a rejected takeoff as a matter of course , since even overrunning the end of the runway is preferable to lifting off with insufficient power to maintain flight the term rotation is used because the aircraft pivots around the axis of its main landing gear while still on the ground , usually because of gentle manipulation of the flight controls to make or facilitate this change in aircraft attitude ( once proper air displacement occurs under / over the wings , an aircraft will lift off on its own ; controls are to ease that in ) besides the helicopter , there are two types of vtol aircraft in military service : craft using a tiltrotor , such as the bell boeing v-22 osprey , and some aircraft using directed jet thrust such as the harrier family the takeoff speed required varies with aircraft weight and aircraft configuration ( flap or slat position , as applicable ) , and is provided to the flight crew as indicated airspeed in a single-engine or light twin-engine aircraft , the pilot calculates the length of runway required to take off and clear any obstacles , to ensure sufficient runway to use for takeoff these speeds are determined not only by the above factors affecting takeoff performance , but also by the length and slope of the runway and any peculiar conditions , such as obstacles off the end of the runway the reason it might be needed is due to the aircraft 's weight exceeding the normal maximum takeoff weight , insufficient power , or the available runway length may be insufficient , or a hot and high airfield , or a combination of all four factors launches for orbital spaceflights , or launches into interplanetary space , are usually from a fixed location on the ground , but may also be from a floating platform such as the san marco platform , or the sea launch launch vessel a headwind will reduce the ground speed needed for takeoff , as there is a greater flow of air over the wings
