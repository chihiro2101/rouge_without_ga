this registration was opposed by amc and the court determined that even though the manufacturing of ramblers ended , the trademark was not abandoned because amc continued to have commercial activities such as parts with the rambler name on the boxes as well franchised dealers with rambler in their name or marketing used cars under the rambler trademark however , it was claimed by crysler as a retro or heritage mark that '' had built an affinity and emotional connection with the consumer as a result of the original product that was in the marketplace , and continues to have nostalgia appeal with consumers who are still interested in acquiring product that is built around the mark ’ s core values and replicates the markets and the mark itself in 1962 , the ambassador , a top-trim level model , was officially brought under the rambler name ( it had previously been named the '' ambassador by rambler '' ) , and the former rambler six and rambler rebel v8 were renamed the rambler classic in 1954 , american motors ( amc ) was formed from the merger of nash-kelvinator and the hudson motor car company '' in a 2008 case before the trademark trial and appeal board , the united states patent and trademark office determined that chrysler continued to have products licensed in connection with the rambler mark for automobiles and thus sufficiently related to automobiles so that consumers would ascribe a single source to the products however , romney 's departure to become michigan governor opened the door for his successor , roy abernethy , to redirect the company towards a strategy of competing head to head with the big three ( general motors , chrysler corporation , and ford motor company ) with a variety of bodies and automobile platforms ( note : while the top-line models for 1958-1961 were advertised as the '' ambassador v-8 by rambler '' , on the cars themselves , the nomenclature was '' rambler ambassador '' the last u.s.-built rambler was produced on 30 june 1969 , and it was one of over 4.2 million cars to carry the rambler name that rolled off the assembly line in kenosha the nash and hudson makes were continued as a '' senior '' model only through 1957 , after which all of amc 's offerings were marketed as ramblers , with the exception of the imported 1958–1962 metropolitan / the rambler trademark registration expired on 12 december 1994 , because chrysler ( the company that acquired amc in 1987 ) did not file an affidavit of continued use crysler , as the successor company , was able to '' prove nonabandonment by demonstrating that there were many rambler autos ( and related supplies ) bearing the mark still in use one of the first moves in that direction was the creation of the 1965 line of ramblers , which split the classic from the ambassador visually , while still sharing a significant number of parts however , the car was an instant success and lost sales only after the '' big three '' ( gm , ford , and chrysler ) each introduced compact cars of their own ( gm '' x '' body , ford falcon , chrysler a platform ) jeffery started commercially mass-producing automobiles in 1902 and by the end of the year had produced 1,500 motorcars , one-sixth of all cars that were manufactured in the u.s as steel quotas ( related to the korean war ) eased , the rambler line was broadened in both its model types ( first a station wagon and 2-door hardtop dubbed '' country club '' , and later a 2-door sedan in 1954 the rambler offered the first industry combination heating and air conditioning unit that could be an add-on or installed at the factory for 395 , which at that time was about the lowest cost unit available in an american car however , steel shortages limited the amount of raw materials that nash could get , so mason turned the compact , now designated the rambler , into a two-door sedan with a convertible top and the cars were equipped with many standard features that were typically options , to maximize profits for the company the rambler 's compact size ( by us standards ) also made it an international competitor , and between 1961 and 1965 amc opened thirteen foreign assembly plants , from costa rica to the philippines
