a 2014 review stated that the variations in ratio of cbd-to-thc in botanical and pharmaceutical preparations determines the therapeutic vs psychoactive effects ( cbd attenuates thc 's psychoactive effects ) of cannabis products overall research into the health effects of medical cannabis has been of low quality and it is not clear whether it is a useful treatment for any condition , or whether harms outweight any benefit comparative studies have found cannabinoids to be more effective than some conventional antiemetics such as prochlorperazine , promethazine , and metoclopramide in controlling cinv , but these are used less frequently because of side effects including dizziness , dysphoria , and hallucinations a 2016 cochrane review said that cannabinoids were '' probably effective '' in treating chemotherapy-induced nausea in children , but with a high side-effect profile ( mainly drowsiness , dizziness , altered moods , and increased appetite ) evidence is lacking for both efficacy and safety of cannabis and cannabinoids in treating patients with hiv/aids or for anorexia associated with aids in the united states , cannabidiol , one of the cannabinoids found in the marijuana plant , has been approved for treating two severe forms of epilepsy , lennox-gastaut syndrome and dravet syndrome typically , adverse effects of medical cannabis use are not serious ; they include tiredness , dizziness , increased appetite , and cardiovascular and psychoactive effects the amount of cannabis normally used for medicinal purposes is not believed to cause any permanent cognitive impairment in adults , though long-term treatment in adolescents should be weighed carefully as they are more susceptible to these impairments although supporters of medical cannabis say that it is safe , further research is required to assess the long-term safety of its use acute effects may include anxiety and panic , impaired attention , and memory ( while intoxicated ) , an increased risk of psychotic symptoms , and possibly increased risk of accidents if a person drives a motor vehicle while intoxicated one study suggested that sustained heavy , daily , adolescent onset cannabis use over decades is associated with a decline in iq by age 38 , with no effects found in those who initiated cannabis use later , or in those who ceased use earlier in adulthood the highest risk of cannabis dependence is found in those with a history of poor academic achievement , deviant behavior in childhood and adolescence , rebelliousness , poor parental relationships , or a parental history of drug and alcohol problems a 2013 literature review found that exposure to marijuana had biologically-based physical , mental , behavioral and social health consequences and was '' associated with diseases of the liver ( particularly with co-existing hepatitis c ) , lungs , heart , and vasculature '' there are numerous other reasons why people look for medical cannabis and to make people aware of whether they are eligible to accept medical cannabis as a dose , there are numerous websites that are currently providing online consultations through video calling a 2004 literature review on the subject concluded that cannabis use is associated with a two-fold increase in the risk of psychosis , but that cannabis use is '' neither necessary nor sufficient '' to cause psychosis the genus cannabis contains two species which produce useful amounts of psychoactive cannabinoids : cannabis indica and cannabis sativa , which are listed as schedule i medicinal plants in the us ; a third species , cannabis ruderalis , has few psychogenic properties ingestion of edible cannabis products lead to a slower onset of effect than the inhalation of it because the thc travels to the liver first through the blood before it travels to the rest of the body smoking has been the means of administration of cannabis for many users , but it is not suitable for the use of cannabis as a medicine it is difficult to predict the pharmacological response to cannabis because concentration of cannabinoids varies widely , as there are different ways of preparing it for consumption ( smoked , applied as oils , eaten , infused into other foods , or drunk ) and a lack of production controls oral preparations are '' problematic due to the uptake of cannabinoids into fatty tissue , from which they are released slowly , and the significant first-pass liver metabolism , which breaks down δ9thc and contributes further to the variability of plasma concentrations '' the us food and drug administration ( fda ) has not approved smoked cannabis for any condition or disease , as it deems that evidence is lacking concerning safety and efficacy the fda issued a 2006 advisory against smoked medical cannabis stating : '' marijuana has a high potential for abuse , has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the united states , and has a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision surviving texts from ancient india confirm that cannabis ' psychoactive properties were recognized , and doctors used it for treating a variety of illnesses and ailments , including insomnia , headaches , gastrointestinal disorders , and pain , including during childbirth the ancient greeks used cannabis to dress wounds and sores on their horses , and in humans , dried leaves of cannabis were used to treat nose bleeds , and cannabis seeds were used to expel tapeworms in the islamic golden age , islamic medicine made use of the diuretic , antiemetic , antiepileptic , anti-inflammatory , analgesic and antipyretic properties of cannabis sativa , and used it extensively as medication from the 8th to 18th centuries the use of cannabis in medicine began to decline by the end of the 19th century , due to difficulty in controlling dosages and the rise in popularity of synthetic and opium-derived drugs also , the advent of the hypodermic syringe allowed these drugs to be injected for immediate effect , in contrast to cannabis which is not water-soluble and therefore can not be injected in the united states , the medical use of cannabis further declined with the passage of the marihuana tax act of 1937 , which imposed new regulations and fees on physicians prescribing cannabis cannabis began to attract renewed interest as medicine in the 1970s and 1980s , in particular due to its use by cancer and aids patients who reported relief from the effects of chemotherapy and cachexia countries that have legalized the medical use of cannabis include australia , brazil , canada , chile , colombia , croatia , cyprus , czech republic , finland , germany , greece , israel , italy , jamaica , lebanon , luxembourg , north macedonia , malta , the netherlands , new zealand , peru , poland , portugal , sri lanka , thailand , the united kingdom , and uruguay countries with the most relaxed policies include canada , uruguay , and the netherlands , where cannabis can be purchased without need for a prescription cannabis is classified as a schedule i drug under the single convention treaty , meaning that medical use is allowed but that it is considered to be an addictive drug with a serious risk of abuse – along with other drugs such as opium and cocaine prior to december 2020 it was also included in schedule iv , a subset of schedule i , which is for only the most dangerous drugs such as heroin and fentanyl in the united states , the use of cannabis for medical purposes is legal in 35 states , four out of five permanently inhabited u.s cannabis remains illegal at the federal level under the controlled substances act , which classifies it as a schedule i drug with a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use in december 2014 , however , the rohrabacher–farr amendment was signed into law , prohibiting the justice department from prosecuting individuals acting in accordance with state medical cannabis laws marijuana vending machines for selling or dispensing cannabis are in use in the united states and are planned to be used in canada almost 70 % of medical cannabis is exported from the united kingdom , according to a 2017 united nations report , with much of the remaining amount coming from canada and the netherlands in the united states , health insurance companies may not pay for a medical marijuana prescription as the food and drug administration must approve any substance for medicinal purposes before this can happen , the fda must first permit the study of the medical benefits and drawbacks of the substance , which it has not done since it was placed on schedule i of the controlled substances act in 1970 medical organizations that have issued statements in support of allowing access to medical cannabis include the american nurses association , american public health association , american medical student association , national multiple sclerosis society , epilepsy foundation , and leukemia & lymphoma society organizations that oppose the legalization of medical cannabis include the american academy of pediatrics and american psychiatric association the american medical association and american college of physicians do not take a position on the legalization of medical cannabis , but have called for the schedule i classification to be reviewed the american cancer society and american psychological association have noted the obstacles that exist for conducting research on cannabis , and have called on the federal government to better enable scientific study of the drug cancer research uk say that while cannabis is being studied for therapeutic potential , '' claims that there is solid 'proof ' that cannabis or cannabinoids can cure cancer is highly misleading to patients and their families , and builds a false picture of the state of progress in this area '' the authors of a report on a 2011 survey of medical cannabis users say that critics have suggested that some users '' game the system '' to obtain medical cannabis ostensibly for treatment of a condition , but then use it for nonmedical purposes – though the truth of this claim is hard to measure nabiximols , an oromucosal spray derived from two strains of cannabis sativa and containing thc and cbd , is not approved in the united states , but is approved in several european countries , canada , and new zealand as of 2013 for reasons including increased popular support of cannabis use , a trend of cannabis legalization , and the perception of medical usefulness , more scientists are doing medical cannabis research
