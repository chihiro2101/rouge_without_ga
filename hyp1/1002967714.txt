the mark 1 translating device , which was developed for the us air force , was able to produce its first automated russian-to-english translation in 1959 and was shown to the public in 1964 ibm 701 competed with remington rand 's univac 1103 in the scientific computation market , which had been developed for the nsa , so it was held secret until permission to market it was obtained in 1951 pugh , ibm 's early computers ( mit press , cambridge , 1986 ) cuthbert hurd ( editor ) , special issue : the ibm 701 thirtieth anniversary - ibm enters the computing field , annals of the history of computing , vol the program , which was developed for play on the ibm 701 , was demonstrated to the public on television based on the trials , the two machines had comparable computational speed , with a slight advantage for ibm 's machine , but the univac was favored unanimously for its significantly faster input-output equipment amdahl discusses his role in the design of several computers for ibm including the ibm 701 , the ibm 704 and the stretch it is still considered a milestone for artificial intelligence and it offered the public during the early 1960s an example of the capabilities of an electronic computer the result of the study was the set of correct rules for hitting , standing , doubling or splitting in a blackjack game which are still the same today on january 7 , 1954 , the team developed an experimental software program that allowed the ibm 701 computer to translate from russian to english the ibm 701 can claim to be the first computer displaying the potential of artificial intelligence in arthur samuel 's checkers-playing program on february 24 , 1956 the 704 was not compatible with the 701 , however , as the 704 increased the size of instructions from 18 bits to 36 bits to support the extra features this is what he said at the stockholders ' meeting , '' as a result of our trip , on which we expected to get orders for five machines , we came home with orders for 18 ‚Äù in 1954 , a group of scientists ran millions of simulated hands of blackjack on an ibm 701 looking to determine the best playing decision for every combination of cards '' i think there is a world market for maybe five computers '' is often attributed to thomas watson , senior in 1943 and junior at several dates in the 1950s in early 1954 , a committee of the joint chiefs of staff requested that the two machines be compared for the purpose of using them for a joint numerical weather prediction project the first magnetic tape drives were used on the tape processing machine ( tpm ) and then adapted to the 701
