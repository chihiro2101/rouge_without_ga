but they were generosi , men of birth , and , being now forced to describe themselves , they disdained to be classed with franklins ( now sinking in the social scale ) , still more with yeomen or husbandmen ; they chose , therefore , to be described as '' gentlemen '' ne dooth his diligence and bisynesse , to kepen his good name '' ; and in the wife of bath 's tale ( 0000 ) : loke who that is most vertuous alway prive and apert , and most entendeth ay to do the gentil dedes that he can and take him for the gretest gentilman in the french allegorical poem the romance of the rose ( ca '' in contemporary usage , the word gentleman is ambiguously defined , because '' to behave like a gentleman '' communicates as little praise or as much criticism as the speaker means to imply ;
