in addition to propellant mining and refueling , the network of spaceports could provide services such as power storage and distribution , in-space assembly and repair of spacecraft , communications relay , shelter , construction and leasing of infrastructure , maintaining spacecraft positioned for future use , and logistics . breaking with tradition , in june 2004 on a runway at mojave air and space port , california , a human was for the first time launched to space in a privately funded , suborbital spaceflight , that was intended to pave the way for future commercial spaceflights ernst stuhlinger , enabling technology for space transportation ( the century of space science , page 66 , kluwer , the world 's first spaceport for orbital and human launches , the baikonur cosmodrome in southern kazakhstan , started as a soviet military rocket range in 1955 oasis official website its analysis claimed that the first phase , placing the '' node 1 '' spaceport with space tug services in low earth orbit ( leo ) , would be commercially profitable and reduce transportation costs to geosynchronous orbit by as much as 44 % ( depending on the launch vehicle ) the 2012 space studies program of the international space university studied the economic benefit of a network of spaceports throughout the solar system beginning from earth and expanding outwardly in phases , within its team project operations and service infrastructure for space ( oasis ) spaceports have been proposed for locations on the moon , mars , orbiting the earth , at sun-earth and earth-moon lagrange points , and at other locations in the solar system however , altitude of the launch site is not a driving factor in spaceport placement because most of the delta-v for a launch is spent on achieving the required horizontal orbital speed the guiana space centre in kourou , french guiana , is the major european spaceport , with satellite launches that benefit from the location 5 degrees north of the equator a rocket launch site is built as far as possible away from major population centers in order to mitigate risk to bystanders should a rocket experience a catastrophic failure
