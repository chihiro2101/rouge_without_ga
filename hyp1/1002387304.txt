it showed how to construct , for any sufficiently powerful and consistent recursively axiomatizable system such as necessary to axiomatize the elementary theory of arithmetic on the ( infinite ) set of natural numbers a statement that formally expresses its own unprovability , which he then proved equivalent to the claim of consistency of the theory ; so that ( assuming the consistency as true ) , the system is not powerful enough for proving its own consistency , let alone that a simpler system could do the job in most of mathematics as it is practiced , the incompleteness and paradoxes of the underlying formal theories never played a role anyway , and in those branches in which they do or whose formalization attempts would run the risk of forming inconsistent theories ( such as logic and category theory ) , they may be treated carefully logicism is a school of thought , and research programme , in the philosophy of mathematics , based on the thesis that mathematics is an extension of a logic or that some or all mathematics may be derived in a suitable formal system whose axioms and rules of inference are 'logical ' in nature but a paradox may be either a surprising but true result in a given formal theory , or an informal argument leading to a contradiction , so that a candidate theory , if it is to be formalized , must disallow at least one of its steps ; in this case the problem is to find a satisfying theory without contradiction the development of category theory in the middle of the 20th century showed the usefulness of set theories guaranteeing the existence of larger classes than does zfc , such as von neumann–bernays–gödel set theory or tarski–grothendieck set theory , albeit that in very many cases the use of large cardinal axioms or grothendieck universes is formally eliminable systematic mathematical treatments of logic came with the british mathematician george boole ( 1847 ) who devised an algebra that soon evolved into what is now called boolean algebra , in which the only numbers were 0 and 1 and logical combinations ( conjunction , disjunction , implication and negation ) are operations similar to the addition and multiplication of integers several schools of the philosophy of mathematics ran into difficulties one after the other in the 20th century , as the assumption that mathematics had any foundation that could be consistently stated within mathematics itself was heavily challenged by the discovery of various paradoxes ( such as russell 's paradox ) more precisely , it shows that the mere assumption of the existence of the set of natural numbers as a totality ( an actual infinity ) suffices to imply the existence of a model ( a world of objects ) of any consistent theory the foundational philosophy of intuitionism or constructivism , as exemplified in the extreme by brouwer and stephen kleene , requires proofs to be '' constructive '' in nature the existence of an object must be demonstrated rather than inferred from a demonstration of the impossibility of its non-existence the concepts or , as platonists would have it , the objects of mathematics are abstract and remote from everyday perceptual experience : geometrical figures are conceived as idealities to be distinguished from effective drawings and shapes of objects , and numbers are not confused with the counting of concrete objects for example , the physics nobel prize laureate richard feynman said and steven weinberg : steven weinberg , chapter against philosophy wrote , in dreams of a final theory weinberg believed that any undecidability in mathematics , such as the continuum hypothesis , could be potentially resolved despite the incompleteness theorem , by finding suitable further axioms to add to set theory this dealt a final blow to the heart of hilbert 's program , the hope that consistency could be established by finitistic means ( it was never made clear exactly what axioms were the '' finitistic '' ones , but whatever axiomatic system was being referred to , it was a 'weaker ' system than the system whose consistency it was supposed to prove ) then the russian mathematician nikolai lobachevsky ( 1792–1856 ) established in 1826 ( and published in 1829 ) the coherence of this geometry ( thus the independence of the parallel postulate ) , in parallel with the hungarian mathematician jános bolyai ( 1802–1860 ) in 1832 , and with gauss this method reached its high point with euclid 's elements ( 300 & nbsp ; bc ) , a treatise on mathematics structured with very high standards of rigor : euclid justifies each proposition by a demonstration in the form of chains of syllogisms ( though they do not always conform strictly to aristotelian templates ) it is based on an iterative process of completion of the theory , where each step of the iteration consists in adding a formula to the axioms if it keeps the theory consistent ; but this consistency question is only semi-decidable ( an algorithm is available to find any contradiction but if there is none this consistency fact can remain unprovable ) there are many possible variants of set theory , which differ in consistency strength , where stronger versions ( postulating higher types of infinities ) contain formal proofs of the consistency of weaker versions , but none contains a formal proof of its own consistency english language versions of this process of deducing the properties of a field can be found in either the book by oswald veblen and john young , projective geometry ( 1938 ) , or more recently in john stillwell 's four pillars of geometry ( 2005 ) the leading school was that of the formalist approach , of which david hilbert was the foremost proponent , culminating in what is known as hilbert 's program , which thought to ground mathematics on a small basis of a logical system proved sound by metamathematics finitism means plato ( 424/423 & nbsp ; bc 348/347 & nbsp ; bc ) insisted that mathematical objects , like other platonic ideas ( forms or essences ) , must be perfectly abstract and have a separate , non-material kind of existence , in a world of mathematical objects independent of humans after many failed attempts to derive the parallel postulate from other axioms , the study of the still hypothetical hyperbolic geometry by johann heinrich lambert ( 1728–1777 ) led him to introduce the hyperbolic functions and compute the area of a hyperbolic triangle ( where the sum of angles is less than 180° ) the truth of a mathematical statement , in this view , is represented by the fact that the statement can be derived from the axioms of set theory using the rules of formal logic precisely , for any consistent first-order theory it gives an '' explicit construction '' of a model described by the theory ; this model will be countable if the language of the theory is countable the discrepancy between rationals and reals was finally resolved by eudoxus of cnidus ( 408–355 & nbsp ; bc ) , a student of plato , who reduced the comparison of irrational ratios to comparisons of multiples ( rational ratios ) , thus anticipating the definition of real numbers by richard dedekind ( 1831 & ndash ; 1916 ) the middle ages saw a dispute over the ontological status of the universals ( platonic ideas ) : realism asserted their existence independently of perception ; conceptualism asserted their existence within the mind only ; nominalism denied either , only seeing universals as names of collections of individual objects ( following older speculations that they are words , '' logoi '' ) as noted by weyl , formal logical systems also run the risk of inconsistency ; in peano axioms , this arguably has already been settled with several proofs of consistency , but there is debate over whether or not they are sufficiently finitism to be meaningful the protestant philosopher george berkeley ( 1685–1753 ) , in his campaign against the religious implications of newtonian mechanics , wrote a pamphlet on the lack of rational justifications of infinitesimal calculus : the analyst , a discourse addressed to an infidel mathematician '' they are neither finite quantities , nor quantities infinitely small , nor yet nothing the german mathematician gottlob frege ( 1848–1925 ) presented an independent development of logic with quantifiers in his begriffsschrift ( formula language ) published in 1879 , a work generally considered as marking a turning point in the history of logic in 1882 , lindemann building on the work of hermite showed that a straightedge and compass quadrature of the circle ( construction of a square equal in area to a given circle ) was also impossible by proving that is a transcendental number abel and galois 's works opened the way for the developments of group theory ( which would later be used to study symmetry in physics and other fields ) , and abstract algebra for over 2,000 years , euclid 's elements stood as a perfectly solid foundation for mathematics , as its methodology of rational exploration guided mathematicians , philosophers , and scientists well into the 19th century this work summarized and extended the work of boole , de morgan , and peirce , and was a comprehensive reference to symbolic logic as it was understood at the end of the 19th century the discovery of the irrationality of , the ratio of the diagonal of a square to its side ( around 5th century & nbsp ; bc ) , was a shock to them which they only reluctantly accepted in the posterior analytics , aristotle ( 384–322 & nbsp ; bc ) laid down the axiomatic method for organizing a field of knowledge logically by means of primitive concepts , axioms , postulates , definitions , and theorems however several difficulties remain : for any consistent theory this usually does not give just one world of objects , but an infinity of possible worlds that the theory might equally describe , with a possible diversity of truths between them this reduction of real numbers and continuous functions in terms of rational numbers , and thus of natural numbers , was later integrated by cantor in his set theory , and axiomatized in terms of second order arithmetic by hilbert and bernays niels henrik abel ( 1802–1829 ) , a norwegian , and évariste galois , ( 1811–1832 ) a frenchman , investigated the solutions of various polynomial equations , and proved that there is no general algebraic solution to equations of degree greater than four ( abel–ruffini theorem ) their existence and nature present special philosophical challenges : how do mathematical objects differ from their concrete representation ? are they located in their representation , or in our minds , or somewhere else ? how can we know them ? the ancient greek philosophers took such questions very seriously a contradiction in a formal theory is a formal proof of an absurdity inside the theory ( such as , showing that this theory is inconsistent and must be rejected
