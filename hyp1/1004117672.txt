the density in metric units was 0.803 & nbsp ; kg/l , so the correct calculation would have been : :7,682 litres × 0.803 kg/l 6,169 kg mass of fuel already on board :22,300 kg − 6,169 kg 16,131 kg mass of additional fuel required , or :16,131 kg ÷ ( 0.803 kg/l ) 20,088 litres volume of additional fuel required at the time of the incident , canada 's aviation sector was in the process of converting from imperial units to the metric system pearson and quintal both used the density of jet fuel in lb/l without converting to kg/l : :7,682 litres × 1.77 lb/l 13,597 lb misinterpreted as kilograms of fuel already on board :22,300 kg − 13,597 kg 8,703 kg incorrect mass of additional fuel required :8,703 kg ÷ ( 1.77 lb/l ) 4,917 l·kg/lb misinterpreted as litres of additional fuel required instead of taking on the 20,088 litres of additional fuel that they required , they took on only 4,917 litres this manoeuvre , performed by '' crossing the controls '' ( applying rudder in one direction and ailerons in the other direction ) is commonly used in gliders and light aircraft to descend more quickly without increasing forward speed , but it is practically never executed in large jet airliners outside of rare circumstances like those of this flight the safety board also said that air canada needed to keep more spare parts , including replacements for the defective fuel quantity indicator , in its maintenance inventory as well as provide better , more thorough training on the metric system to its pilots and fuelling personnel '' it further found that the airline had failed to reallocate the task of checking fuel load ( which had been the responsibility of the flight engineer on older aircraft flown with a crew of three ) pearson consulted the master minimum equipment list ( mmel ) , which indicated that the aircraft was not legal to fly with blank fuel gauges but due to a misunderstanding , pearson believed that it was safe to fly if the amount of fuel was confirmed with measuring sticks ( the source contains two typos regarding the weight of fuel already on board : 6669 and 66169 , instead of the correct value of 6169 ) the flight management system ( fmc ) measures fuel consumption , allowing the crew to keep track of fuel burned as the flight progresses on july & nbsp ; 23 , 2008 , the 25th anniversary of the incident , pilots pearson and quintal were celebrated in a parade in gimli , and a mural was dedicated to commemorate the landing korean air cargo flight 6316 air transat flight 236 ethiopian airlines flight 961 hapag-lloyd flight 3378 taca flight 110 ural airlines flight 178 us airways flight 1549 cathay pacific flight 780 british airways flight 38 list of airline flights that required gliding mars climate orbiter , which was lost because of a navigation error when a subcontractor used us customary units ( pound-seconds ) instead of the metric units ( newton-seconds ) as specified by nasa after the airliner had touched down , the nose began to scrape along the guardrail in the centre of the race track , creating additional frictional drag that contributed to the plane 's deceleration ; pearson applied extra right brake , which caused the main landing gear to straddle the guardrail to add to his own misconceptions about the condition in which the aircraft had been flying since the previous day , reinforced by what he saw in the cockpit , pearson now had a signed-off maintenance log that it had become custom to prefer over the mmel two factors helped avert disaster : the failure of the front landing gear to lock into position during the gravity drop , and the presence of a guardrail that had been installed along the centre of the repurposed runway to facilitate its use as a drag race track as the gimli pilots performed a partial side-slip manoeuvre ( forward slip ) to reduce altitude prior to landing , the disrupted airflow past the ram air turbine also meant a decrease in the hydraulic power available , and they were surprised to find the aircraft slow to respond when straightening after the forward-slip to calculate how much fuel the airplane had to take on , he needed to convert the volume ( litres ) to mass ( kilograms ) , subtract that figure from 22,300 & nbsp ; kg , and convert the result back into volume the fueler reported that the density of jet fuel at the time was 1.77 , which was in pounds/litre since other air canada aircraft used pounds flight ac7067 was captained by jean-marc bélanger , a former head of the air canada pilots association , while captains robert pearson and maurice quintal were on board to oversee the flight from montreal to california 's mojave airport since the engines supply power for the hydraulic systems , the aircraft was designed with a ram air turbine , a backup generator that swings out from a compartment and converts the air flowing past the airplane into rotational movement the amount of fuel in the tanks of a boeing 767 is computed by the fuel quantity indication system ( fqis ) and displayed in the cockpit the boeing 767 belonged to a new generation of aircraft that flew with only a pilot and co-pilot , but air canada had not clearly assigned responsibility for supervising the fueling the use of the incorrect conversion factor led to a total fuel load of only 22,300 pounds ( 10,100 & nbsp ; kg ) rather than the 22,300 kilograms that was needed captain pearson would later remark that the boys were so close that he could see the looks of sheer terror on their faces as they realized that a large , passenger-laden aircraft was bearing down on them - the boeing 767 , was only classed as a medium-size airliner however when empty still weighed roughly 80 tonnes without passengers before he could disable the second channel again , however , he was called away to perform a floatstick measurement of fuel remaining in the tanks , leaving the circuit breaker tagged ( which masked the fact that it was no longer pulled ) as they communicated their intentions to controllers in winnipeg and tried to restart the left engine , the cockpit warning system sounded again with the '' all engines out '' sound , a sharp '' bong '' that no one in the cockpit could recall having heard before at this point , quintal proposed landing at the former rcaf station gimli , a closed air force base where he had once served as a pilot for the royal canadian air force in the event of one failing , the other could still operate alone , but in that case , the indicated quantity was required to be cross-checked against a floatstick measurement before departure the lack of hydraulic pressure prevented flap/slat extension that would have , under normal landing conditions , reduced the stall speed of the aircraft and increased the lift coefficient of the wings to allow the airliner to be slowed for a safe landing the 767 was one of the first airliners to include an electronic flight instrument system , which operated on the electricity generated by the aircraft 's jet engines this reports that the fuel gauges were blank and that the second fqis channel was disabled , but does not make clear that the latter fixed the former , 1992 , freefall : from 41,000 feet to zero – a true story , william and marilyn hoffer , simon & schuster , 1989 engineering disasters – lessons to be learned , don lawson , asme press , 2005 , , pages 221–29 deal specifically with gimli glider the aviation safety board of canada ( predecessor of the modern transportation safety board of canada ) reported that air canada management was responsible for '' corporate and equipment deficiencies '' he used the altitude from one of the mechanical backup instruments , while the distance travelled was supplied by the air traffic controllers in winnipeg , measured by the aircraft 's radar echo observed at winnipeg on january & nbsp ; 24 , 2008 , the gimli glider took its final voyage , ac7067 , from montreal trudeau to tucson international airport before flying to its retirement in the mojave desert in california as the aircraft 's nose had collapsed onto the ground , its tail was elevated and there were some minor injuries when passengers exited the aircraft via the rear slides , which were not long enough to sufficiently accommodate the increased height
