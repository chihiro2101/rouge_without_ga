whereas the first phase of shōen development in the early heian period had seen the opening of new lands and the granting of the use of lands to aristocrats and religious institutions , the second phase saw the growth of patrimonial '' house governments '' , as in the old clan system the heian period was preceded by the nara period and began in 794 ce after the movement of the capital of japan to heian-kyō ( modern kyoto ) , by the 50th emperor , emperor kanmu as the soga clan had taken control of the throne in the sixth century , the fujiwara by the ninth century had intermarried with the imperial family , and one of their members was the first head of the emperor 's private office 1180 ( june ) : the capital is moved to fukuhara-kyō ( kobe ) 1180 ( november ) : the capital is moved back to heian-kyō ( kyōto ) 1185 : taira is defeated ( genpei war ) and minamoto no yoritomo with the support ( backing ) of the hōjō clan seizes power , becoming the first shōgun of japan , while the emperor ( or '' mikado '' ) becomes a figurehead stability came to japan , but , even though succession was ensured for the imperial family through heredity , power again concentrated in the hands of one noble family , the fujiwara which also helped japan develop more while on one hand , the heian period was an unusually long period of peace , it can also be argued that the period weakened japan economically and led to poverty for all but a tiny few of its inhabitants the lyrics of the modern japanese national anthem , kimigayo , were written in the heian period , as was the tale of genji by murasaki shikibu , one of the first novels ever written a decline in food production , the growth of the population , and competition for resources among the great families all led to the gradual decline of fujiwara power and gave rise to military disturbances in the mid-tenth and eleventh centuries in the end , the fujiwara were destroyed , the old system of government supplanted , and the insei system left powerless as bushi took control of court affairs , marking a turning point in japanese history hiragana gave written expression to the spoken word and , with it , to the rise in japan 's famous vernacular literature , much of it written by court women who had not been trained in chinese as had their male counterparts in the manga and tv series hikaru no go , the protagonist hikaru shindo is visited by a ghost of a go genius from the heian period and its leading clan , fujiwara no sai the player is able to choose one of the most powerful families of japan at the time , the taira , minamoto or fujiwara ;
