a wonderful series of these forms occurs in southern utah , where in passing northward from the carboniferous platform one ascends in succession the chocolate cliffs ( triassic sandstones ) , vermilion and white cliffs ( jurassic sandstones ) , the gray cliffs ( cretaceous sandstones , of remarkably cross-bedded structure , interpreted as the dunes of an ancient desert ) , and finally the pink cliffs ( eocene strata of fluviatile and lake origin ) of the high , forested plateaus the mogollon rim escarpment is part of the transition zone between the mogollon plateau of the colorado plateau province and the sonoran desert of the basin and range province the most important line of cliffs of this class is associated with the western and southern boundary of the plateau province where it was uplifted from the lower ground another consequence of revived erosion is seen in the occurrence of great landslides , where the removal of weak ( permian ) clays has sapped the face of the vermilion cliffs , so that huge slices of the cliff face have slid down and forward , all shattered into a confused tumult of forms for a or more along the cliff base the henry mountains in southwestern utah are peculiar in owing their relief to the doming or blistering up of the plateau strata by the underground intrusion of large bodies or cisterns ( laccolites ) of lava , now more or less exposed by erosion the province is characterized by numerous disconnected mountain ranges trending north and south , from in length , the higher ranges reaching altitudes of , separated by broad , intermontane desert plains or basins at altitudes varying from sea-level ( or a little less ) in the southwest , to farther inland the structure of the region previous to faulting was dependent on long antecedent processes of accumulation and deformation and the surface of the region then was dependent on the amount of erosion suffered in the prefaulting cycle when the region was broken into fault blocks and the blocks were uplifted and tilted , the back slope of each block was a part of the previously eroded surface and the face of the block was a surface of fracture the present form of the higher blocks is more or less affected by erosion since faulting , while many of the lower blocks have been buried under the waste of the higher ones in the great basin of western utah and through most of nevada , many of the blocks exhibit deformed structures involving folds and faults of relatively ancient ( jurassic ) date in the upper southern part of the basin and range province , in the mojave desert of california , and sonoran desert of southern california and arizona ( u.s ) and northern sonora ( mexico ) states , the ranges are well dissected and some of the intermontane depressions have rock floors with gentle , centripetal slopes a much larger but still narrow medial area is drained southwestward by the colorado river to the head of the gulf of california , where this large and very turbid river has formed the extensive colorado river delta , north of which the former head of the gulf is now cut off from the sea and laid bare by evaporation as a plain below sea-level it is in the lower colorado river valley that an irrigation project , involving the diversion of some of the river water to the low plain of the imperial valley , led to disaster in 1904 the outlines of the eastern lake bonneville and the western lake lahontan water bodies are well recorded by shore lines and deltas on the enclosing slopes , hundreds of feet above the present lake surfaces the duration of the pleistocene lakes was brief as compared with the time since the dislocation of the faulted blocks , as is shown by the small dimensions of the lacustrine beaches compared to the great volume of the ravine-heading fans on which the beaches often lie here , the shore-line of the lava contours evenly around the spurs and enters , bay-like , into the valleys of the enclosing mountains , occasionally isolating an outlying mass thus the uplifted , dislocated and dissected lava sheets of yellowstone national park in the rocky mountains on the east ( at the headwaters of the snake river ) are associated with the older lavas of the columbian plains along parts of their eastern border , where the rainfall is a little increased by the approach of the westerly winds to the rocky mountains , there is a belt of very deep , impalpably fine soil , supposed to be a dust deposit brought from the drier parts of the plains farther west
