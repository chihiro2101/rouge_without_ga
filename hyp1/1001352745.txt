this cycle may be repeated several times a week or , in more serious cases , several times a day and may directly cause : chronic gastric reflux after eating , secondary to vomiting dehydration and hypokalemia due to renal potassium loss in the presence of alkalosis and frequent vomiting electrolyte imbalance , which can lead to cardiac arrhythmia , cardiac arrest , and even death esophagitis , or inflammation of the esophagus mallory-weiss tears boerhaave syndrome , a rupture in the esophageal wall due to vomiting oral trauma , in which repetitive insertion of fingers or other objects causes lacerations to the lining of the mouth or throat russell 's sign : calluses on knuckles and back of hands due to repeated trauma from incisors perimolysis , or severe acid erosion of tooth enamel swollen salivary glands ( for example , in the neck , under the jaw line ) gastroparesis , or delayed gastric emptying constipation or diarrhea tachycardia or palpitations hypotension peptic ulcers infertility constant weight fluctuations are common elevated blood sugar , cholesterol , and amylase levels may occur hypoglycemia may occur after vomiting these are some of the many signs that may indicate whether someone has bulimia nervosa : a fixation on the number of calories consumed a fixation on and extreme consciousness of one 's weight low self-esteem and/or self-harming suicidal tendencies an irregular menstrual cycle in women regular trips to the bathroom , especially soon after eating depression , anxiety disorders and sleep disorders frequent occurrences involving consumption of abnormally large portions of food the use of laxatives , diuretics , and diet pills compulsive or excessive exercise unhealthy/dry skin , hair , nails and lips fatigue , or exhaustion as with many psychiatric illnesses , delusions can occur , in conjunction with other signs and symptoms , leaving the person with a false belief that is not ordinarily accepted by others some positive outcomes of treatments can include : abstinence from binge eating , a decrease in obsessive behaviors to lose weight and in shape preoccupation , less severe psychiatric symptoms , a desire to counter the effects of binge eating , as well as an improvement in social functioning and reduced relapse rates however , while these patients may have met modern criteria for bulimia nervosa , they can not technically be diagnosed with the disorder , as it had not yet appeared in the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders at the time of their treatment another study by the royal children 's hospital in melbourne on a cohort of 2,000 adolescents similarly found that those meeting at least two of the dsm-iv criteria for bulimia nervosa or anorexia nervosa had a sixfold increase in risk of anxiety and a doubled risk for substance dependency p.344 bulimia nervosa may affect up to 1 % of young women and , after 10 years of diagnosis , half will recover fully , a third will recover partially , and 10–20 % will still have symptoms in a 1991 study by weltzin , hsu , pollicle , and kaye , it was stated that 19 % of bulimics undereat , 37 % of bulimics eat an average or normal amount of food , and 44 % of bulimics overeat working with bn patients and their families in fbt can empower the families by having them involved in their adolescent 's food choices and behaviors , taking more control of the situation in the beginning and gradually letting the adolescent become more autonomous when they have learned healthier eating habits one study found 70 % had depression at some time in their lives ( as opposed to 26 % for adult females in the general population ) , rising to 88 % for all affective disorders combined a survey of 15- to 18-year-old high school girls in nadroga , fiji , found the self-reported incidence of purging rose from 0 % in 1995 ( a few weeks after the introduction of television in the province ) to 11.3 % in 1998 there are higher rates of eating disorders in groups involved in activities which idealize a slim physique , such as dance , gymnastics , modeling , cheerleading , running , acting , swimming , diving , rowing and figure skating the onset of bulimia nervosa is often during adolescence , between 13 and 20 years of age , and many cases have previously suffered from obesity , with many sufferers relapsing in adulthood into episodic bingeing and purging even after initially successful treatment and remission in contrast , byrne and mclean 's findings differed slightly from fairburn et al.s cognitive behavioral model of bulimia nervosa in that the drive for thinness was the major cause of purging as a way of controlling weight there is a perception that bulimia is most prevalent amongst girls from middle-class families ; however , in a 2009 study girls from families in the lowest income bracket studied were 153 percent more likely to be bulimic than girls from the highest income bracket people with bulimia are more likely than people without bulimia to have an affective spectrum , such as depression or general anxiety disorder bulimia typically involves rapid and out-of-control eating , which may stop when the person is interrupted by another person or the stomach hurts from over-extension , followed by self-induced vomiting or other forms of purging in humans , there is evidence that there is an association between polymorphisms in the erβ ( estrogen receptor β ) and bulimia , suggesting there is a correlation between sex hormones and bulimia nervosa the use of cognitive behavioral therapy ( cbt ) has been shown to be quite effective for treating bulimia nervosa ( bn ) in adults , but little research has been done on effective treatments of bn for adolescents cognitive behavioral therapy ( cbt ) , which involves teaching a person to challenge automatic thoughts and engage in behavioral experiments ( for example , in session eating of '' forbidden foods '' ) has a small amount of evidence supporting its use therefore , young adolescents with bn are less likely to realize the detrimental consequences of becoming bulimic and have less motivation to change , which is why fbt would be useful to have families intervene and support the teens bulimia is thought to be more prevalent among caucasians ; however , a more recent study showed that african-american teenage girls were 50 percent more likely than caucasian girls to exhibit bulimic behavior , including both binging and purging p.343 the diagnostic criteria utilized by the dsm-5 includes repetitive episodes of binge eating ( a discrete episode of overeating during which the individual feels out of control of consumption ) compensated for by excessive or inappropriate measures taken to avoid gaining weight this includes fluoxetine , which is fda approved , for the treatment of bulimia , other antidepressants such as sertraline may also be effective against bulimia however , bulimia nervosa 's prevalence was still much higher than anorexia nervosa 's , which at the time occurred in about 14 people per 100,000 recently , the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders was revised , which resulted in the loosening of criteria regarding the diagnoses of bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa in addition , the suicide rate among people with bulimia nervosa is 7.5 times higher than in the general population at the turn of the century , bulimia ( overeating ) was described as a clinical symptom , but rarely in the context of weight control the diagnosis also requires the episodes of compensatory behaviors and binge eating to happen a minimum of once a week for a consistent time period of 3 months some with anorexia nervosa exhibit episodes of bulimic tendencies through purging ( either through self-induced vomiting or laxatives ) as a way to quickly remove food in their system in addition , the cognitive behavioral model of bulimia nervosa is very cultural bound in that it may not be necessarily applicable to cultures outside of the western society bulimia nervosa occurs more frequently in developed countries and in cities , with one study finding that bulimia is five times more prevalent in cities than in rural areas in 1979 , gerald russell first published a description of bulimia nervosa , in which he studied patients with a '' morbid fear of becoming fat '' who overate and purged afterwards ellen west , a patient described by ludwig binswanger in 1958 , was teased by friends for being fat and excessively took thyroid pills to lose weight , later using laxatives and vomiting although cbt is seen as more cost-efficient and helps individuals with bn in self-guided care , family based treatment ( fbt ) might be more helpful to younger adolescents who need more support and guidance from their families
