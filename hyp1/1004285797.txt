mpeg-7 is intended to provide complementary functionality to the previous mpeg standards , representing information about the content , not the content itself ( '' the bits about the bits '' ) in addition , mpeg-7 descriptions could be used to improve the functionality of previous mpeg standards.with these tools , we can build an mpeg-7 description and deploy it according to the requirements document,1 “ a description consists of a description scheme ( structure ) and the set of descriptor values ( instantiations ) that describe the data mpeg-7 uses the following tools : descriptor ( d ) : it is a representation of a feature defined syntactically and semantically description schemes ( ds ) : specify the structure and semantics of the relations between its components , these components can be descriptors ( d ) or description schemes ( ds ) description definition language ( ddl ) : it is based on xml language used to define the structural relations between descriptors it allows the creation and modification of description schemes and also the creation of new descriptors ( d ) the first commercial mpeg-7 application , frameline 47 uses an advanced content schema based on mpeg-7 so as to be able to notate entire video files , or segments and groups of segments from within that video file according to the mpeg-7 convention ( commercial tool ) eptascape ads200 uses a real-time mpeg 7 encoder on an analog camera video signal to identify interesting events , especially in surveillance applications , check the demos to see mpeg-7 in action ( commercial tool ) ibm videoannex annotation tool : creating mpeg-7 documents for video streams describing structure and giving keywords from a controlled vocabulary ( binary release , restrictive license ) ifinder medienanalyse- und retrievalsystem : metadata extraction and search engine based on mpeg-7 ( commercial tool ) mpeg-7 audio encoder : creating mpeg-7 documents for audio documents describing low level audio characteristics ( binary & source release , java , gpl ) mpeg-7 visual descriptor extraction : software to extract mpeg-7 visual descriptors from images and image regions all 17 mpeg-7 low level audio descriptors are implemented ( commercial ) tu berlin mpeg-7 spoken content demonstrator ( web-demo ) : creating mpeg-7 documents ( xml ) with spokencontent description from an input speech signal ( wav , mp3 ) ( commercial ) mp7jrs c++ library complete mpeg-7 implementation of part 3 , 4 and 5 ( visual , audio and mds ) by joanneum research institute for information and communication technologies - audiovisual media group for example , the running time of a movie annotated using mpeg-7 in xml is machine-readable data , so software agents will know that the number expressing the running time is a positive integer , but such data is not machine-interpretable ( can not be understood by agents ) , because it does not convey semantics ( meaning ) , known as the “ semantic gap ” to address this issue , there were many attempts to map the mpeg-7 xml schema to the web ontology language ( owl ) , which is a structured data equivalent of the terms of the mpeg-7 standard ( mpeg-7ontos , comm , swinto , etc manjunath ( editor ) , philippe salembier ( editor ) , and thomas sikora ( editor ) : introduction to mpeg-7 : multimedia content description interface
