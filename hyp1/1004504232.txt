harvard economist dani rodrik argues that while globalization and free trade does contribute to social problems , '' a serious retreat into protectionism would hurt the many groups that benefit from trade and would result in the same kind of social conflicts that globalization itself generates according to economic historians findlay and o'rourke , there is a consensus in the economics literature that protectionist policies in the interwar period '' hurt the world economy overall , although there is a debate about whether the effect was large or small '' according to oxford economic historian kevin o'rourke , '' it seems clear that protection was important for the growth of us manufacturing in the first half of the 19th century ; but this does not necessarily imply that the tariff was beneficial for gdp growth protectionists have often pointed to german and american industrialization during this period as evidence in favor of their position , but economic growth is influenced by many factors other than trade policy , and it is important to control for these when assessing the links between tariffs and growth this is because '' the growth of manufacturing—and of the myriad other jobs that the new export sector creates—has a ripple effect throughout the economy '' that creates competition among producers , lifting wages and living conditions mainstream economists do concede that tariffs can in the short-term help domestic industries to develop , but are contingent on the short-term nature of the protective tariffs and the ability of the government to pick the winners economists such as paul krugman have speculated that those who support protectionism ostensibly to further the interests of workers in the least developed countries are in fact being disingenuous , seeking only to protect jobs in developed countries proponents of this theory point to the constant warfare in the 17th and 18th centuries among european countries whose governments were predominantly mercantilism and protectionist , the american revolution , which came about ostensibly due to british tariffs and taxes , as well as the protective policies preceding both world war i and world war ii since the end of world war ii , it has been the stated policy of most first world countries to eliminate protectionism through free trade policies enforced by international treaties and organizations such as the world trade organization certain policies of first world governments have been criticized as protectionist , however , such as the common agricultural policy in the european union , longstanding agricultural subsidies and proposed '' buy american '' provisions in economic recovery packages in the united states adherence to this pledge is monitored by the global trade alert , providing up-to-date information and informed commentary to help ensure that the g20 pledge is met by maintaining confidence in the world trading system , deterring beggar-thy-neighbor acts and preserving the contribution that exports could play in the future recovery of the world economy
