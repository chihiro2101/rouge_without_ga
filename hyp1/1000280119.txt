by the time of operation linebacker ii in 1972 , the americans had gained critical information about the performance and operations of the s-75 ( by arab 's s-75 systems were captured by israel ) , and used these missions as a way to demonstrate the capability of strategic bombers to operate in a sam saturated environment list of surface-to-air missiles anti-aircraft warfare man-portable air-defense systems missile guidance list of nato reporting names for surface-to-air missiles list of missiles list of anti-aircraft weapons suppression of enemy air defenses ( sead ) , the mission of finding and destroying sam and aa gun installations it would also be the first and only time that the latest and most modern air defense technologies of the soviet union and the most modern jet fighter planes and bombers of the united states confronted each other in combat the first historical mention of a concept and design of a surface-to-air missile in which a drawing was presented , was by inventor gustav rasmus in 1931 , who proposed a design that would home in on the sound of an aircraft 's engines marshall michel , '' the christmas bombing '' , air and space , january 2001 by the conclusion of the linebacker ii campaign , the shootdown rate of the s-75 against the b-52s was 7.52 % ( 15 b-52s were shot down , 5 b-52s were heavily damaged for 266 missiles ) zaloga , steven j this leads to three '' natural '' classes of sam systems ; heavy long-range systems that are fixed or semi-mobile , medium-range vehicle-mounted systems that can fire on the move , and short-range man-portable air-defense systems ( manpads ) the british developed unguided antiaircraft rockets ( operated under the name z battery ) close to the start of world war ii , but the air superiority usually held by the allies meant that the demand for similar weapons was not as acute '' nike zeus '' , flight international , 2 august 1962 concerns about ajax 's ability to deal with formations of aircraft led to greatly updated version of the same basic design entering service in 1958 as the nike hercules , the first nuclear-armed sam modern long-range weapons include the patriot and s-300 ( missile ) systems , which have effective ranges on the order of 150 & nbsp ; km , and offer relatively good mobility and short unlimbering times these weapons were released from stand-off distances , with the bomber remaining outside the range of the ship 's antiaircraft guns , and the missiles themselves were too small and fast to be attacked effectively this was seen generally ; in november 1943 the director of gunnery division of the royal navy concluded that guns would be useless against jets , stating '' no projectile of which control is lost when it leaves the ship can be of any use to us in this matter this emerged in 1957 as the famous s-75 dvina ( sa-2 ) , a portable system , with very high performance , that remained in operation into the 2000s joseph stalin was worried that moscow would be subjected to american and british air raids , like those against berlin , and , in 1951 , he demanded that a missile system to counter a 900 bomber raid be built as quickly as possible '' s-400 missile defense systems to start defending moscow july 1 '' , ria novosti , 21 may 2007 medium-range designs , like the rapier and 2k12 kub , are specifically designed to be highly mobile with very fast , or zero , setup times rapid improvement in the 1980s led to second generation designs , like the fim-92 stinger , 9k34 strela-3 ( sa-14 ) and starstreak , with dramatically improved performance led by bell labs , the nike ajax was tested in production form in 1952 , becoming the first operational sam system when it was activated in march 1954 as the urgency of the problem grew , new designs were added , including enzian and rheintochter , as well as the unguided taifun which was designed to be launched in waves through the evolution of sams , improvements were also being made to anti-aircraft artillery , but the missiles pushed them into ever shorter-range roles in order to attack a target , guns fire continually while the aircraft are in range in order to launch as many shells as possible , increasing the chance that one of these will end up within the lethal range two competing designs were proposed for '' stage 1 '' , based on common radar and control units , and these emerged as the raf 's bristol bloodhound in 1958 , '' bloodhound : the sagw system of the royal air force during world war ii , efforts were started to develop surface-to-air missiles as it was generally considered that flak was of little use against bombers of ever-increasing performance ship-based anti-aircraft missiles are also considered to be sams , although in practice it is expected that they would be more widely used against sea skimming missiles rather than aircraft sarh has the advantage of leaving most of the equipment on the ground , while also eliminating the need for the ground station to communicate with the missile after launch the first known idea for a guided surface-to-air missile was in 1925 , when a beam riding system was proposed whereby a rocket would follow a searchlight beam onto a target phillip hays , '' history of the talos missile '' heavy shipping losses to kamikaze attacks during the liberation of the philippines and the battle of okinawa provided additional incentive for guided missile development the first serious consideration of a sam development project was a series of conversations that took place in germany during 1941 the introduction of sea-skimming missiles in the late 1960s and 1970s led to additional mid- and short-range designs for defence against these targets this led to the s-25 berkut system ( sa-1 in nato terminology ) , which was designed , developed and deployed in a rush program all sam systems from the smallest to the largest generally include identified as friend or foe ( iff ) systems to help identify the target before being engaged the directors of the luftwaffe flak arm were not interested in manned aircraft , and the resulting disagreements between the teams delayed serious consideration of a sam for two years 22 dramatic changes followed , and by the end of the series missions were carried out with additional chaff , ecm , iron hand , and other changes dramatically changed the score the soviet union began development of a sam system in earnest with the opening of the cold war von axthelm published his concerns in 1942 , and the subject saw serious consideration for the first time ; initial development programs for liquid- and solid-fuel rockets became part of the flak development program of 1942 when landing at an airfield in thailand , one b-52 was heavily damaged by sam , rolled out of the runway and blown up on mines installed around the airfield to protect the guerrillas , only one crewman survived early efforts to directly attack the missiles sites as part of operation spring high and operation iron hand were generally unsuccessful , but the introduction of wild weasel aircraft carrying agm-45 shrikes and the standard arm missile changed the situation dramatically the introduction of effective sams led to the cancellation of the b-70 bomber , and the prohibition of manned recce flights over the soviet union known as manpads , the first example was a royal navy system known as the holman projector , used as a last-ditch weapon on smaller ships
