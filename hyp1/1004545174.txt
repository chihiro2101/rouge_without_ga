to generate the key table , one would first fill in the spaces in the table ( a modified polybius square ) with the letters of the keyword ( dropping any duplicate letters ) , then fill the remaining spaces with the rest of the letters of the alphabet in order ( usually omitting '' j '' or '' q '' to reduce the alphabet to fit ; other versions put both '' i '' and '' j '' in the same space ) in this story , a playfair message is demonstrated to be cryptographically weak , as the detective is able to solve for the entire key making only a few guesses as to the formatting of the message ( in this case , that the message starts with the name of a city and then a date ) to perform the substitution , apply the following 4 rules , in order , to each pair of letters in the plaintext : if both letters are the same ( or only one letter is left ) , add an '' x '' after the first letter when only the ciphertext is known , brute force cryptanalysis of the cipher involves searching through the key space for matches between the frequency of occurrence of digrams ( pairs of letters ) and the known frequency of occurrence of digrams in the assumed language of the original message if the letters appear on the same row of your table , replace them with the letters to their immediate right respectively ( wrapping around to the left side of the row if a letter in the original pair was on the right side of the row ) using '' playfair example '' as the key ( assuming that i and j are interchangeable ) , the table becomes ( omitted letters in red ) : p l a y f i r e x m b c d g h k n o q s t u v w z encrypting the message '' hide the gold in the tree stump '' ( note the null '' x '' used to separate the repeated '' e '' s ) : hi de th eg ol di nt he tr ex es tu mp ^ if the letters appear on the same column of your table , replace them with the letters immediately below respectively ( wrapping around to the top side of the column if a letter in the original pair was on the bottom side of the column ) if there are no double letter digrams in the ciphertext and the length of the message is long enough to make this statistically significant , it is very likely that the method of encryption is playfair switching letters , rows , or reflecting the entire square ) to see if the candidate plaintext is more like standard plaintext than before the change ( perhaps by comparing the digrams to a known frequency chart ) as the german numbers 1 ( eins ) to twelve ( zwölf ) contain all but eight of the letters in the double playfair squares , pro forma traffic was relatively easy to break ( smith , page 74-75 ) in the novel york : the map of stars ( part three of a trilogy for children ) by laura ruby , a clue to solving the morningstarr cipher is encrypted using the playfair cipher . wheatstone offered to demonstrate that three out of four boys in a nearby school could learn to use it in 15 minutes , but the under secretary of the foreign office responded , '' that is very possible , but you could never teach it to attachés wheatstone invented the cipher for secrecy in telegraphy , but it carries the name of his friend lord playfair , first baron playfair of st the key can be written in the top rows of the table , from left to right , or in some other pattern , such as a spiral beginning in the upper-left-hand corner and ending in the center to decrypt , use the inverse ( opposite ) of the last 3 rules , and the first as-is ( dropping any extra '' x '' s or '' q '' s that do not make sense in the final message when finished ) if the letters are not on the same row or column , replace them with the letters on the same row respectively but at the other pair of corners of the rectangle defined by the original pair
