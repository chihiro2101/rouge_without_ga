however , the boundary layer would separate early , as the pressure gradient switched from favorable ( pressure decreasing in the flow direction ) to unfavorable ( pressure increasing in the flow direction ) , creating a large region of low pressure behind the ball that creates high form drag in many geophysical flows ( rivers , atmospheric boundary layer ) , the flow turbulence is dominated by the coherent structures and turbulent events the turbulent events are associated with coherent flow structures such as eddies and turbulent bursting , and they play a critical role in terms of sediment scour , accretion and transport in rivers as well as contaminant mixing and dispersion in rivers and estuaries , and in the atmosphere in the medical field of cardiology , a stethoscope is used to detect heart sounds and bruits , which are due to turbulent blood flow this turbulent diffusion coefficient is defined in a phenomenological sense , by analogy with the molecular diffusivities , but it does not have a true physical meaning , being dependent on the flow conditions , and not a property of the fluid itself in addition , the turbulent diffusivity concept assumes a constitutive relation between a turbulent flux and the gradient of a mean variable similar to the relation between flux and gradient that exists for molecular transport nevertheless , the turbulent diffusivity is the simplest approach for quantitative analysis of turbulent flows , and many models have been postulated to calculate it in fluid dynamics , they are essentially vortices subjected to stretching associated with a corresponding increase of the component of vorticity in the stretching directionâ€”due to the conservation of angular momentum in general , the stretching mechanism implies thinning of the vortices in the direction perpendicular to the stretching direction due to volume conservation of fluid elements ; dissipation : to sustain turbulent flow , a persistent source of energy supply is required because turbulence dissipates rapidly as the kinetic energy is converted into internal energy by viscous shear stress via this energy cascade , turbulent flow can be realized as a superposition of a spectrum of flow velocity fluctuations and eddies upon a mean flow turbulent flows may be viewed as made of an entire hierarchy of eddies over a wide range of length scales and the hierarchy can be described by the energy spectrum that measures the energy in flow velocity fluctuations for each length scale ( wavenumber ) ; integral time scale the integral time scale for a lagrangian flow can be defined as : : t \left ( \frac \ , , since the experimental values obtained for the second order structure function only deviate slightly from the value predicted by kolmogorov theory , the value for is very near to ( differences are about 2 % ) this behavior , and the lack of universality of the constants , are related with the phenomenon of intermittency in turbulence this is an important area of research in this field , and a major goal of the modern theory of turbulence is to understand what is really universal in the inertial range .
