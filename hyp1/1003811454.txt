where once 240 pence made a tower pound ( and 256 make a troy pound ) , by the time of the weights and measures acts ( uk ) of 1824 , a troy pound gives 792 silver pence , still minted as such as maundy money the british imperial troy ounce ( known more commonly simply as the imperial troy ounce ) was based on , and virtually identical with , the pre-1824 british troy ounce and the pre-1707 english troy ounce before the adoption of the metric system , many systems of troy weights were in use in various parts of europe , among them holland troy , paris troy , etc the british imperial system of weights and measures ( also known as imperial units ) was established in 1824 , prior to which the troy weight system was a subset of pre-imperial english units the troy pound is 5760 & nbsp ; grains ( ≈ 373.24 & nbsp ; g , 12 & nbsp ; oz & nbsp ; t ) , while an avoirdupois pound is approximately 21.53 % heavier at 7000 & nbsp ; grains ( ≈ 453.59 & nbsp ; g ) both are currently based on a grain of 0.06479891 & nbsp ; gram ( exact , by definition ) , with 480 grains to a troy ounce ( compared with grains for an ounce avoirdupois ) charles moore watson ( 1844–1916 ) proposes an alternative etymology : the assize of weights and measures ( also known as tractatus de ponderibus et mensuris ) , one of the statutes of uncertain date from the reign of either henry iii or edward i , thus before 1307 , specifies '' troni ponderacionem '' —which the public record commissioners translate as '' troy weight '' ) an alternative suggestion is that the weights come from the muslim domains by way of the gold dirham ( 47.966 british imperial grains ) , in the manner that king offa 's weights were derived from the silver dirhem ( about 45.0 british grains ) we can derive an exact value for the troy ounce as follows : :1 lb an avoirdupois pound also equals 7,000 grains ( the international yard and pound agreement did not change the grain values of non-metric units ) the name '' troy '' is first attested in 1390 , describing the weight of a platter , in an account of the travels in europe of the earl of derby the british empire abolished the 12-ounce troy pound in the 19th century , though it has been retained ( although rarely used ) in the american system
