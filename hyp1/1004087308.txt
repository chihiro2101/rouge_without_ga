the full statement of ramsey 's theorem for hypergraphs is that for any integers m and c , and any integers n 1 , … , n c , there is an integer r ( n 1 , … , n c ; c , m ) such that if the hyperedges of a complete m-hypergraph of order r ( n 1 , … , n c ; c , m ) are coloured with c different colours , then for some i between 1 and c , the hypergraph must contain a complete sub-m-hypergraph of order n i whose hyperedges are all colour i firstly , any given vertex will be the middle of either 0 & nbsp ; × & nbsp ; 5 & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 0 ( all edges from the vertex are the same colour ) , 1 & nbsp ; × & nbsp ; 4 & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 4 ( four are the same colour , one is the other colour ) , or 2 & nbsp ; × & nbsp ; 3 & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 6 ( three are the same colour , two are the other colour ) such triples this is the directed-graph analogue of what ( above ) has been called r ( n , & nbsp ; n ; & nbsp ; 2 ) , the smallest number z such that any 2-colouring of the edges of a complete undirected graph with ≥ & nbsp ; z nodes , contains a monochromatic complete graph on n nodes '' ) we have r ( 0 ) & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 0 , r ( 1 ) & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 1 , r ( 2 ) & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 2 , r ( 3 ) & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 4 , r ( 4 ) & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 8 , r ( 5 ) & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 14 , r ( 6 ) & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 28 , and 32 & nbsp ; ≤ & nbsp ; r ( 7 ) & nbsp ; ≤ & nbsp ; 54 there are ( up to symmetries ) only two non-trivial multicolour ramsey numbers for which the exact value is known , namely r ( 3 , 3 , 3 ) & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 17 and r ( 3 , 3 , 4 ) & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 30 it goes as follows : count the number of ordered triples of vertices , x , y , z , such that the edge , ( xy ) , is red and the edge , ( yz ) , is blue ) if any of the edges , ( r , s ) , ( r , t ) , ( s , t ) , are also blue then we have an entirely blue triangle pick a vertex from the graph , and partition the remaining vertices into two sets and , such that for every vertex , is in if is blue , and is in if is red in reverse mathematics , there is a significant difference in proof strength between the version of ramsey 's theorem for infinite graphs ( the case n 2 ) and for infinite multigraphs ( the case n ≥ 3 ) in contrast , by a theorem of david seetapun , the graph version of the theorem is weaker than aca 0 , and ( combining seetapun 's result with others ) it does not fall into one of the big five subsystems the electronic journal of combinatorics dynamic survey of small ramsey numbers ( by stanisław radziszowski ) ramsey number – from mathworld ( contains lower and upper bounds up to r ( 19 , 19 ) ) ramsey number – geoffrey exoo ( contains r ( 5 , 5 ) > 42 counter-proof ) image : clebsch graph.svg thumb right clebsch graphif we select any colour of either the untwisted or twisted colouring on k 16 , and consider the graph whose edges are precisely those edges that have the specified colour , we will get the clebsch graph let r ( n ) be the smallest number q such that any complete graph with singly directed arcs ( also called a '' tournament '' ) and with ≥ & nbsp ; q nodes contains an acyclic ( also called '' transitive '' ) n-node subtournament
