jennings is the inventor and first to patent the commercial dry cleaning process known as '' dry scouring '' , on march 3 , 1821 ( patent number : us 3,306x ) by the mid-1930s , the dry cleaning industry had adopted tetrachloroethylene ( perchloroethylene ) , or pce for short , as the solvent the many oh groups bind water , leading to swelling of the fabric and leading to wrinkling , which is minimized when these materials are treated with tetrachloroethylene and other dry cleaning solvents at this time , dry cleaning was carried out in two different machines—one for the cleaning process , and the second to remove the solvent from the garments the toxicity of tetrachloroethylene '' is moderate to low '' and '' reports of human injury are uncommon despite its wide usage in dry cleaning and degreasing '' svg dry clean , tetrachloroethylene ( pce ) only file : professionelle reinigung ( p ) s.svg gentle cleaning with pce file : professionelle reinigung ( p ) ss.svg very gentle cleaning with pce file : nicht chemisch reinigen.svg do not dry clean image : tetrachloroethylene.svg thumb left 160 px tetrachloroethylene is the main solvent used in dry cleaning until this time , the cleaning is done in normal temperature , as the solvent is never heated in dry cleaning process after the drying cycle is complete , a deodorizing ( aeration ) cycle cools the garments and removes further traces of solvent , by circulating cool outside air over the garments and then through a vapor recovery filter made from activated carbon and polymer resins during the wash cycle , the solvent in the chamber ( commonly known as the 'cage ' or 'tackle box ' ) is passed through a filtration chamber and then fed back into the 'cage ' garments are placed in the washing or extraction chamber ( referred to as the 'basket ' or 'drum ' ) , which constitutes the core of the machine the density of perchloroethylene is around 1.7 g/cm 3 at room temperature ( 70 % heavier than water ) , and the sheer weight of absorbed solvent may cause the textile to fail under normal force during the extraction cycle unless the mesh bag provides mechanical support non-polar solvents are also good for some fabrics , especially natural fabrics , as the solvent does not interact with any polar groups within the fabric the condensed solvent is fed into a separator unit where any remaining water is separated from the solvent and then fed into the 'clean solvent ' tank it will contain solvent , powdered filter material ( diatomite ) , carbon , non-volatile residues , lint , dyes , grease , soils , and water in the early days of dry cleaning , large amounts of perchlorethylene were vented to the atmosphere because it was regarded as cheap and believed to be harmless the dry cleaning process involves charging a sealed chamber which is loaded with clothes using gaseous carbon dioxide from a storage vessel to approximately 200 to 300 psi during the drying cycle , the garments are tumbled in a stream of warm air ( 60–63 & nbsp ; °c/140–145 & nbsp ; °f ) that circulates through the basket , evaporating traces of solvent left after the spin cycle in enclosed machines , solvent recovered during the drying process is returned condensed and distilled , so it can be reused to clean further loads or safely disposed of the first step is a button trap , which prevents small objects such as lint , fasteners , buttons , and coins from entering the solvent pump flammability concerns led william joseph stoddard , a dry cleaner from atlanta , to develop stoddard solvent ( white spirit ) as a slightly less flammable alternative to gasoline-based solvents much stricter controls on solvent emissions have ensured that all dry cleaning machines in the western world are now fully enclosed , and no solvent fumes are vented to the atmosphere he was the first african-american to be granted a patent of any kind , although there were attempts to prevent him ; opponents claimed that the nature of the process was dangerous the extraction cycle begins by draining the solvent from the washing chamber and accelerating the basket to 350–450 & nbsp ; rpm , causing much of the solvent to spin free of the fabric modern dry cleaning 's use of non-water-based solvents to remove soil and stains from clothes was reported as early as 1855 it is among the more expensive solvents , but it is faster cleaning , lower temperatures , and quick dry times this discharge does not occur in liquid carbon dioxide and the build-up of an electrical charge on the surface of the fabric attracts the dirt back on to the surface , which diminishes its cleaning efficiency during the wash cycle , the chamber is filled approximately one-third full of solvent and begins to rotate , agitating the clothing the waste sludge or solid residue from the still contains solvent , water , soils , carbon , and other non-volatile residues also , the binding of water molecules interferes with weak attractions within the fiber , resulting in the loss of the fiber 's original shape many machines use '' spin disk filters '' , which remove the muck from the filter by centrifugal force while it is back washed with solvent to enhance cleaning power , small amounts of detergent ( 0.5–1.5 % ) are added to the working solvent and are essential to its functionality at the end of the wash cycle , the machine starts a rinse cycle where the garment load is rinsed with freshly distilled solvent dispensed from the solvent tank
