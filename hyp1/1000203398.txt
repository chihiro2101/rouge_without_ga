the mullamullang member of this formation is a unconformity member , being separated by 5 million years ; the third member is the abrakurrie limestone that was formed in a central depression of the earlier formation ; this is late oligocene to early miocene in age and does not reach the edge of the plain ; the last two formations are conforming formations ; the late eocene toolinna limestone lies on the wilsons bluff limestone which is mid- to late eocene in age ; and the toolinna limestone does not cover the whole nullarbor and is extant only in the extreme east beside the abrakurrie formation which lies in a depression their ride took advantage of the low temperatures in the australian winter months and was completed over 4 days , 5 hours and 21 minutes , making it one of the fastest bicycle crossings and the fastest done with a single-geared bike
