the special features an animated short of goodnight moon , narrated by susan sarandon , along with six other animated segments of children 's bedtime stories and lullabies with live-action clips of children reflecting on a series of bedtime topics in between , a reprise of goodnight moon at the end , and the everly brothers ' '' all i have to do is dream '' playing over the closing credits for example , the room of goodnight moon generally resembles the next-to-last spread of the runaway bunny , where the little bunny becomes a little boy and runs into a house , and the mother bunny becomes the little boy 's mother ; shared details include the fireplace and the painting by the fireplace of '' the cow jumping over the moon '' , though other details differ ( the colors of the walls and floor are switched , for instance ) the text is a rhyming poem , describing an anthropomorphic bunny 's bedtime ritual of saying '' good night '' to various inanimate and living objects in the bunny 's bedroom : a red balloon , a pair of socks , the bunny 's dollhouse , a bowl of mush , and two kittens , among others ; despite the kittens , a mouse is present in each spread the painting of three bears , sitting in chairs , alludes to '' goldilocks and the three bears '' ( originally '' the story of the three bears '' ) , and itself has a copy of the cow jumping over the moon painting the painting is itself a reference to the nursery rhyme '' hey diddle diddle '' , where a cow jumps over the moon however , when reprinted in goodnight moon , the udder was reduced to an anatomical blur to avoid the controversy that e.b the top shelf of the bookshelf , below the runaway bunny painting , holds an open copy of the runaway bunny , and there is a copy of goodnight moon on the nightstand from the time of its publication in 1947 and until 1972 , the book was '' banned '' by the new york public library due to the then head children 's librarian anne carroll moore 's hatred of the book this picture is also a reference to the runaway bunny , where it is the first colored spread , when the mother says that if the little bunny becomes a fish , she will become a fisherman and fish for him goodnight moon contains a number of references to brown and hurd 's the runaway bunny , and to traditional children 's literature '' harpercollins had the reluctant permission of hurd 's son , thacher hurd , but the younger hurd said the photo of hurd with his arm and fingers extended , holding nothing , '' looks slightly absurd to me '' a parody written by david milgrim and published under the pseudonym “ ann droyd ” in october 2011 , goodnight ipad : a parody for the next generation “ shows a very different homelife 50 years later , with mobile devices , social networks , and non-stop streaming media brown , who died in 1952 , bequeathed the royalties to the book ( among many others ) to albert clarke , who was the nine-year-old son of a neighbor when brown died author susan cooper writes that the book is possibly the only '' realistic story '' to gain the universal affection of a fairy-tale , although she also noted that it is actually a '' deceptively simple ritual '' rather than a story
