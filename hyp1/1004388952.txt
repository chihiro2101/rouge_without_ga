then the name was changed to that of the well-known character from david copperfield , uriah heep ( for , according to biographer kirk blows , '' dickens ' name being everywhere around christmas '69 due to it being the hundredth anniversary of his death '' ) according to dave ling 's 2001 autobiography of the band , wizards and demons , the uriah heep story , though the '' uriah heep '' moniker was chosen in december 1969 , the band continued to play gigs as '' spice '' until ken hensley joined in february 1970 i was a big vanilla fudge fan , with their hammond organ and searing guitar on top , and we had david 's high vibrato vocals anyway so that 's how we decided to shape it , '' box recalled their 1970 debut album , …very 'eavy …very 'umble ( released as uriah heep in the united states ) , introduced hensley 's heavy organ and the band 's guitar-driven sound , with david byron 's theatrical , dynamic vocals soaring above thunderous sonic backgrounds , although acoustic and jazz elements also featured in the mix hensley had little to contribute to the debut : box and byron wrote most of the material , including '' gypsy '' , in many ways ( according to blows ) '' in a 1989 interview , mick box recalled , '' the funny thing was we wrote it at the hanwell community centre , and deep purple were rehearsing in the room next door to us '' those unfamiliar with uriah heep may want to try out demons and wizards or a compilation first , but anyone with a serious interest in uriah heep or the roots of heavy metal will find plenty to like on produced by gerry bron , the second album went a long way to ( according to allmusic ) perfect uriah heep 's '' blend of heavy metal power and prog rock complexity '' and was also significant for ken hensley 's instant rise to the position of main songwriter among the stand-outs were the title track , '' tears in my eyes '' and '' july morning '' , an epic many heep fans regard as equal to led zeppelin 's '' stairway to heaven '' and deep purple 's '' child in time '' feeling marginalised and having recently been badly shaken up when he was involved in an accident in germany in one of the band 's cars , first bassist paul newton left , in november of '71 , and was briefly replaced by mark clarke newton recalled in a 2000 interview on uriah heep 's website his departure : '' well , as you know , my father managed the band in the early days , with the gods and spice while its title and roger dean 's sleeve both suggested that the band was romantically working medieval myth into their songs—and surely songs like '' rainbow demon '' and '' the wizard '' ( co-written by mark clarke , during his short stay ) did have thematic links with fantasy world—a more straightforward , hard-rocking approach was also apparent '' ken hensley remembered : two singles were released from the album : '' the wizard '' and '' easy livin ' '' , the second ( a defiant rocker , according to blows , '' 31 us ) came out , with '' sweet lorraine '' released as an american single and the title track ( a multi-part fantasy epic featuring hensley–byron vocal duel and box 's extensive guitar solo in the middle ) being the album 's highlight having gained worldwide recognition , the band quit the fantasy world in lyrics and made an obvious stab at versatility by adding funk ( '' dreamer '' ) and an acoustic number along the lines of contemporary singer/songwriters ( '' circus '' ) elements to the palette according to blows , '' a strenuous touring schedule , compounded by the bassist 's heavy drug dependency ( inherent even before joining heep ) was taking its toll , though matters came to a head while on tour during september , '' when the bassist received a serious electric shock on stage in dallas during a gig at southern methodist university ’ s moody coliseum on 15 september 1974 soon after going out of hospital , thain , in sounds , openly accused manager gerry bron of having turned uriah heep into a mere '' financial thing '' and was fired two months after the group 's final gig of 1974 at new theatre in oxford , england on 14 december john wetton ( ex-family and king crimson ) joined the band in march 1975 and with him return to fantasy ( june 1975 ) was recorded ; representing a revitalised uriah heep , it soared up to no in november 1975 the best of uriah heep compilation was released , preceded by two solo albums : byron 's debut take no prisoners and hensley 's second , eager to please it was considered lightweight ; even box stated : '' less of the 'eavy and more of the 'umble '' ( making pointed reference to uriah heep 's self-description as '' 'umble '' in dickens ' david copperfield ) uriah heep recruited bassist trevor bolder ( ex-david bowie , mick ronson ) , and after having auditioned david coverdale ( deep purple , whitesnake ) , ian hunter and gary holton ( heavy metal kids ) , brought in john lawton , formerly of lucifer 's friend and the les humphries singers , with whom they turned totally away from fantasy-oriented lyrics and multi-part compositions back towards a more straightforward hard rock sound typical of the era blows ) , '' a new vigour and confidence '' ( according to a record mirror review ) and also the new singer 's abilities : the latter ( according to allmusic ) , although lacking the multi-octave range of david byron , '' …boasted an impressive and emotionally rich hard rock voice that instantly jelled with the uriah heep sound in germany the album sold over a million copies and became uriah heep 's most successful , which coincided with the success of the re-released '' lady in black '' for some time during this period , there were three uriah heep singles sitting together in the german top 20 , these being '' wise man '' ( from firefly ) , '' lady in black '' and '' free me '' in the end of 1978 , fallen angel came out , having completed a hat-trick of studio albums to feature a consistent lineup ( only the second time in their career that they had done so ) '' too poppy '' for mick box 's liking ( but still , '' too eccentric to fit the bill of an aor record , '' according to allmusic ) , it was well received at the time ( sounds gave it 4 stars ) but failed to chart blows writes , '' the combination of constant friction between the two ( resulting in the nearest thing to violence the group had seen ) and the constant presence of lawton 's wife on the road finally led to the vocalist getting the chop , shortly after playing the bilzen festival in belgium in august 1979 '' ex-lone star john sloman was brought in , a younger singer who played keyboards and guitar and was , in the words of box , '' conquest lp was released in february 1980 ( worldwide except the united states , where it was never released ) and received 5 stars from record mirror , but , according to box , '' was a difficult album to record '' and represented '' a confused heep , '' even '' a mess '' ( in the words of trevor bolder ) hensley was very unhappy , primarily with sloman , and he explained why : a meeting at the manager 's office concerning the songwriting dissent was the last straw and , in september 1980 , hensley quit produced by ashley howe , the abominog album ( according to blows ) was , '' …important…in the way it pulled heep out of the seventies and thrust them into the eighties with determination muscle , '' even if sounded a bit too american sounds gave it a five star review , the newly established rock magazine kerrang ! declared it '' the most mature and perhaps best album of their career '' and in retrospect it is still seen as '' one of the most consistent and engaging albums in the group 's lengthy catalog head first ( may 1983 ) , produced again by ashley howe ( who , according to goalby , became '' like the sixth member of the band '' ) , followed much in the same vein , pursuing ( according to allmusic ) '' uriah heep toured the us supporting rush , judas priest and def leppard , whose vocalist joe elliott remembered : '' they were the best band that we 've ever toured with either as a headline or support , because there was no ego , no pretentious kind of stuff '' by this time gerry bron was uriah heep manager no longer ( they were looked after by neil warnock in europe and blue oyster cult 's management team in the us ) and then , finally , bronze records collapsed under the weight of debts , which , according to box , '' american singer steff fontaine , formerly of christian metal band joshua , joined in july 1986 but he was criticised for being totally '' unprofessional '' ( he missed , for some reason , a san francisco gig ) and was sacked in september 1986 after just one american tour the lineup remained unchanged from 1986 until 2007 , being veteran mick box at the helm , trevor bolder on bass , lee kerslake on drums , vocalist bernie shaw and phil lanzon on keyboards in december 1987 they became the first ever western rock band to play in the soviet union , under mikhail gorbachev 's policy of glasnost ( western pop acts boney m , cliff richard , nitty gritty dirt band and elton john had already played shows there in the late 70s during the pre-gorbachev era ) at moscow 's olympic stadium the band played ten consecutive nights to a total of 180,000 people ( following a reception that bernie shaw remembered as being '' something like beatlemania '' ) , which was represented in the international press as not just an achievement for uriah heep but a major breakthrough for western music in general '' the last two years have been the most enjoyable of all my time in heep , '' trevor bolder was quoted to say at the time the band played in the central tv studios in nottingham on 29 november 1989 ( the film was shown as part of the independent tv series bedrock and a few years later it was repeated in the cue music series ) and celebrated its 20th anniversary with a series of compilations and re-issues in late march/early april 1995 , the band 's former singer , john lawton , briefly rejoined uriah heep for two weeks to tour south africa and austria with deep purple , filling in for bernie shaw , who was suffering from voice problems at the time , had '' a grand , epic tone throughout '' that , according to rock critic steve huey , '' does n't always match uriah heep 's journeyman-sounding prog-tinged hard rock , still being a solid entry in its chosen genre '' earlier in 2001 , during the summer , the group embarked on its first us tour in seven years and returned the following year to headline both nights of classic rock productions classic rock festival at the patriots theater at the trenton war memorial in trenton , new jersey on 5 and 6 october 2002 , alongside mostly autumn , asia ,
