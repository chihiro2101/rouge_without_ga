vlf waves can penetrate seawater to a depth of at least 10–40 & nbsp ; meters ( 30–130 & nbsp ; feet ) , depending on the frequency employed and the salinity of the water , so they are used to communicate with submarines due to the narrow bandwidth of the band , audio ( voice ) transmission can not be used , and text transmission is limited to a slow data rate of around 300 & nbsp ; bits per second , or about 35 & nbsp ; eight-bit ascii characters per second : : this is because vlf waves are reflected from the bottom of the ionosphere , while higher frequency shortwave signals are returned to earth from higher layers in the ionosphere , the f1 and f2 layers , by a refraction process , and spend most of their journey in the ionosphere , so they are much more affected by ionization gradients and turbulence due to its long propagation distances and stable phase characteristics , during the 20th & nbsp ; century the vlf band was used for long range hyperbolic radio navigation systems which allowed ships and aircraft to determine their geographical position by comparing the phase of radio waves received from fixed vlf navigation beacon transmitters the earth is surrounded by a conductive layer of electrons and ions in the upper atmosphere at the bottom of the ionosphere called the d layer at 60–90 & nbsp ; km ( 37–56 & nbsp ; miles ) altitude , which reflects vlf radio waves useful received signal strengths are as low as & nbsp ; volts/meter ( electric field ) and & nbsp ; tesla ( magnetic field ) , with signaling rates typically between 1 and 100 & nbsp ; bits per hour the large vlf antennas used for high power transmitters usually have bandwidths of only 50-100 & nbsp ; hertz , and when transmitting frequency shift keying ( fsk ) , the usual mode , the resonant frequency of the antenna must sometimes be dynamically shifted with the modulation , between the two fsk frequencies radiated power from amateur stations is very small , ranging from 1 & nbsp ; μw to 100 & nbsp ; μw for fixed base station antennas , and up to 10 & nbsp ; mw from kite or balloon antennas the simplest and earliest form of radio data transmission , this was used from the beginning of the 20th & nbsp ; century to the 1960s in commercial and military vlf stations for example , a frequency of 9070 & nbsp ; hz might be used to indicate a ' 1 ' and the frequency 9020 & nbsp ; hz , 50 & nbsp ; hz lower , to indicate a ' 0 ' msk can be used at data rates up to 300 & nbsp ; bit/s , or about 35 & nbsp ; ascii characters ( 8 & nbsp ; bits each ) per second , approximately 450 & nbsp ; words per minute ; minimum-shift keying ( msk ) : a continuous phase version of fsk designed specifically for small bandwidths , this was adopted by naval vlf stations in the 1970s to increase the data rate and is now the standard mode used in military vlf transmitters due to their low radiation resistance ( often less than one ohm ) they are inefficient , radiating only 10 % to 50 % of the transmitter power at most , with the rest of the power dissipated in the antenna/ground system resistances in the 1920s the discovery of the skywave ( skip ) radio propagation method allowed lower power transmitters operating at high frequency to communicate at similar distances by reflecting their radio waves off a layer of ionized atoms in the ionosphere , and long distance radio communication stations switched to the shortwave frequencies because of the small bandwidth of the band , and the extremely narrow bandwidth of the antennas used , it is impractical to transmit audio signals ( am or fm radiotelephony ) operations tend to congregate around the frequencies 8.27 & nbsp ; khz , 6.47 & nbsp ; khz , 5.17 & nbsp ; khz , and 2.97 & nbsp ; khz in the usa , the time signal station wwvl began transmitting a 500 & nbsp ; w signal on 20 & nbsp ; khz in august & nbsp ; 1963 vertical antennas must be used because vlf waves propagate in vertical polarization , but a quarter-wave vertical antenna at 30 & nbsp ; khz ( 10 & nbsp ; km wavelength ) would be high the bandwidth of large capacitively loaded vlf antennas is so narrow ( 50–100 & nbsp ; hz ) that even the small frequency shifts of fsk and msk modulation may exceed it , throwing the antenna out of resonance , causing the antenna to reflect some power back down the feedline vlf waves have very low path attenuation , 2–3 & nbsp ; db per 1,000 & nbsp ; km , with little of the '' fading '' experienced at higher frequencies to minimize dielectric losses in the soil , the ground conductors are buried shallowly , only a few inches in the ground , and the ground surface near the antenna is protected by copper ground screens the three types of modulation that have been used in vlf transmitters are : ; continuous wave ( cw ) , interrupted continuous wave ( icw ) , or on-off keying : morse code radiotelegraphy transmission with unmodulated carrier if the two frequencies representing ' 1 ' and ' 0 ' are 50 & nbsp ; hz apart , the standard frequency shift used in military vlf stations , their phases coincide every 20 & nbsp ; ms since it can penetrate seawater vlf is used by the military to communicate with submarines near the surface , while elf frequencies are used for deeply submerged subs the of large vlf antennas is typically over 200 ; this means the antenna stores far more energy ( 200 & nbsp ; times as much ) than is supplied or radiated in any single cycle of the transmitter current because of the high q factor the carrier can not be switched abruptly on and off but requires a long time constant , many cycles , to build up the oscillating energy in the antenna when the carrier turns on , and many cycles to dissipate the stored energy when the carrier turns off because of their long wavelengths , vlf radio waves can diffract around large obstacles and so are not blocked by mountain ranges , and can propagate as ground waves following the curvature of the earth and so are not limited by the horizon
