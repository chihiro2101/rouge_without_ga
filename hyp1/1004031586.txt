james was sent to the royal high school where he had as a friend , jimmy patterson , the son of a local iron founder being already interested in mechanics he spent much of his time at the foundry and there he gradually learned to work and turn in wood , brass , iron , and steel in 1820 he left the high school and again made great use of his father 's workshop where at the age of 17 , he made his first steam engine from 1821 to 1826 , nasmyth regularly attended the edinburgh school of arts ( today heriot-watt university , making him one of the first students of the institution ) nasmyth therefore decided instead to show maudslay examples of his skills and produced a complete working model of a high-pressure steam engine , creating the working drawings and constructing the components himself he moved to patricroft , an area of the town of eccles , lancashire , where in august 1836 , he and his business partner holbrook gaskell opened the bridgewater foundry , where they traded as nasmyth , gaskell and company his connection with the great western railway whose famous steamship ss great western had been so successful in voyages between bristol and new york , led to him being asked to make some machine tools of unusual size and power which were required for the construction of the engines of their next and bigger ship ss great britain in 1837 , the great western steam company was experiencing many problems forging the paddle shaft of the ss great britain ; when even the largest hammer was tilted to its full height its range was so small that if a really large piece of work were placed on the anvil , the hammer had no room to fall , and in 1838 the company 's engineer wrote to nasmyth : '' i find there is not a forge-hammer in england or scotland powerful enough to forge the paddle-shaft of the engine for the great britain ! what am i to do ? ” ( francis humphries , 1838 ) nasmyth thought the matter over and seeing the obvious defects of the trip hammer ( it delivered every blow with the same force ) sketched out his idea for the first steam hammer nasmyth made a sketch of his steam hammer design dated 24 november 1839 , but the immediate need disappeared when the practicality of screw propellers was demonstrated and the great britain was converted to that design the french engineer françois bourdon came up with the similar idea of what he called a '' pilon '' in 1839 and made detailed drawings of his design , which he also showed to all engineers who visited the works at le creusot owned by the brothers adolphe and eugène schneider by 1856 a total of 490 hammers had been produced which were sold across europe to russia , india and even australia , and accounted for 40 % of james nasmyth and company 's revenues apart from the steam hammer , nasmyth created several other important machine tools , including the shaper , an adaptation of the planer which is still used in tool and die making among nasmyth 's other inventions , most of which he never patented , were a means of transmitting rotary motion by means of a flexible shaft made of coiled wire , a machine for cutting key grooves , self-adjusting bearings , and the screw ladle for moving molten metal which could safely and efficiently be handled by two men instead of the six previously required bessemer , however , acknowledged the efforts of nasmyth by offering him a one-third share of the value of his patent for the eponymous bessemer process he settled down near penshurst , kent , where he renamed his retirement home '' hammerfield '' and happily pursued his various hobbies including astronomy he built his own 20-inch nasmyth telescope , in the process inventing the nasmyth focus , and made detailed observations of the moon this book contains an interesting series of '' lunar '' photographs : because photography was not yet advanced enough to take pictures at very high magnification directly of the moon itself , nasmyth built plaster relief scale models based on his visual observations of the moon and then photographed the models under electric illumination , replicating the shadows of the topographic contours he observed on the moon in memory of his renowned contribution to the discipline of mechanical engineering , the department of mechanical engineering building at heriot-watt university , in his birthplace of edinburgh , is called the james nasmyth building
