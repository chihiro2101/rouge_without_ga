some of the surviving live transmissions of the nazi german television station fernsehsender paul nipkow , dating as far back as the 1930s , were recorded by pointing a 35mm camera to a receiver 's screen , although most surviving nazi live television programs such as the 1936 summer olympics ( not to confuse with the cinematic footage made during the same event by leni riefenstahl for her film olympia ) , a number of nuremberg rally , or official state visits ( such as benito mussolini 's ) were shot directly on 35mm instead and transmitted over the air as a television signal , with only a two minutes ' delay from the original event , by means of the so-called zwischenfilmverfahren ( see intermediate film system ) from an early production truck on the site prior to the introduction of videotape in 1956 , kinescopes were the only way to record television broadcasts , or to distribute network television programs that were broadcast live from new york or other originating cities , to stations not connected to the network , or to stations that wished to show a program at a time different than the network broadcast cbs and nbc instituted a '' hot kinescope '' process in 1952 , where shows being performed in new york were transmitted west , filmed on two kinescope machines in 35 & nbsp ; mm negative and 16 & nbsp ; mm reversal film ( the latter for backup protection ) in los angeles , rushed to film processing , and then transmitted from los angeles three hours later for broadcast in the pacific time zone for kinescopes , 16 & nbsp ; mm film was the common choice by most studios because of the lower cost of stock and film processing , but in the larger network markets , it was not uncommon to see 35 & nbsp ; mm kinescopes , particularly for national rebroadcast however , the telerecording process left colour information in the form of chroma dots in the frames of the film ; using a specially designed computer programme , these chroma dots were used to bring out the original colour information , which as then applied to the film , allowing the colour to be restored to the episode a 35 & nbsp ; mm or 16 & nbsp ; mm camera exposes one frame of film for every one frame of television ( 525 lines ) , and moving a new frame of film into place during the time equivalent of one field of television ( 131.25 lines ) the time taken physically to move the film on by one frame and stop it so that the gate can be opened to expose a new frame of film to the two fields of television picture is much longer than the vertical blanking interval between these fields—so the film is still moving when the start of the next field is being displayed on the television screen therefore , in order to maintain successful kinescope photography , a camera must expose one frame of film for exactly 1/30th or 1/25th of a second , the time in which one frame of video is transmitted , and move to another frame of film within the small interval of 1/120 of a second the '' classic 39 '' syndicated episodes of the honeymooners were filmed using electronicam ( as well as the daily five-minute syndicated series les paul & mary ford in 1954–55 ) , but with the introduction of a practical videotape recorder only one year away , the electronicam system never saw widespread use in 1951 , the stars and producers of the hollywood-based television series i love lucy , desi arnaz and lucille ball , decided to film the show directly onto 35 & nbsp ; mm film using the multicamera setup , instead of broadcasting it live the major drawback , apart from the short duration of a 16 & nbsp ; mm film magazine , was that a large opaque frame had to be placed in front of the tv set in order to block out any stray reflections , making it impossible to watch the set normally while filming a development on the suppressed field system was to display the image from one of the fields at a much higher intensity on the television screen during the time when the film gate was closed , and then capture the image as the second field was being displayed although domestic use of telerecording in the uk for repeat broadcasts dropped off sharply after the move to color in the late 1960s , 16 & nbsp ; mm black and white film telerecordings were still being offered for sale by british broadcasters well into the 1970s defects often encountered in photographic recording include relatively poor image resolution ; a compressed brightness range often limited by kinescope display technology to a brightness ratio of about 40:1 ; nonlinearity of recordings , as exemplified by lack of gradation in both the near-white and near-black portions of the reproduced pictures ; and excessive image noise due to film grain and video processing artifacts a bbc executive , cecil madden , later recalled filming a production of the scarlet pimpernel in this way , only for film director alexander korda to order the burning of the negative as he owned the film rights to the book , which he felt had been infringed up until the early 1960s , much of the bbc 's output , and british television in general , was broadcast live , and telerecordings would be used to preserve a programme for repeat showings , which had previously required the entire production being performed live for a second time from the following month , the wedding of princess elizabeth to prince philip also survives , as do various early 1950s productions such as it is midnight , dr schweitzer , the lady from the sea and the opening two episodes of the quatermass experiment , although in varying degrees of quality using this shutter , in 1 second of video ( 60 fields equaling 30 frames ) , 48 television fields ( totaling to 24 frames of video ) would be captured on 24 frames of film , and 12 additional fields would be omitted as the shutter closed and the film advanced a recording of a 1975 episode of australian series this day tonight is listed on the national archives of australia website as a kinescope , while surviving episodes of the 1978 drama series the truckies also exist as kinescopes , indicating that the technology was still being used by abc at that point many recovered programmes , particularly those made by the bbc , have been returned as telerecordings by foreign broadcasters or private film collectors from the 1980s onwards , as the bbc has taken stock of the large gaps in its archive and sought to recover as much of the missing material as possible programs originally shot with film cameras ( as opposed to kinescopes ) were also used in television 's early years , although they were generally considered inferior to the big-production '' live '' programs because of their lower budgets and loss of immediacy the promoters of electronovision ( not to be confused with electronicam ) gave the impression that this was a new system created from scratch , using a high-tech name ( and avoiding the word kinescope ) to distinguish the process from conventional film photography another technique developed by the bbc , known as 'spot wobble ' , involved the addition of an extremely high frequency but low voltage sine wave to the vertical deflection plate of the television screen , which changed the moving 'spot ' - a circular beam of electrons by which the television picture was displayed - into an elongated oval by law , all film supplied to tv stations , both 16 & nbsp ; mm and 35 & nbsp ; mm had to be on a non-flammable , safety film base but as an article in american cinematographer explained , : in the beginning there was a very definite reason for the decision of desilu productions to put i love lucy on film instead of doing it live and having kinescope recordings carry it to affiliate outlets of the network by adjusting the intensity of the first field , it was possible to arrange it so that the luminosity of the phosphor had decayed to exactly match that of the second field , so that the two appeared to be at the same level and the film camera captured both.this method came to be preferred this procedure had the advantage of capturing both fields of the frame on a film , but it was difficult to keep the mirrors running at the right speed and all the equipment adjusted correctly , which often resulted in poor quality output a kinescope must be able to : convert the 30 frame/s image to 24 frame/s , the standard sound speed of film cameras , do so in a way so that the image is clear enough to then re-broadcast by means of a film chain back to 30 frame/s because television is a field- rather than frame-based system , however , not all the information in the picture can be retained on film in the same way as it can on videotape even after the introduction of quadruplex videotape machines in 1956 removed the need for '' hot kines '' , the television networks continued to use kinescopes in the '' double system '' method of videotape editing even after the introduction of videotape , the bbc and the itv companies made black and white kinescopes of selected programs for international sales , and continued to do so until the early 1970s by which time programs were being videotaped in colour in the british 405-line television system , the french 819-line television system and the greater european 576i , television ran at 25 frames—or more correctly , 50 fields—per second , so the film camera would also be run at 25 frames per second rather than the cinematic film standard of 24 frames when reversed , a high-quality television monitor was set up in place of the projection screen , and unexposed film stock is run through at the point where the lamp was illuminating the film an additional problem was that the whole procedure took place in an open room and it was known for insects to settle on the screen which were then permanently present on the film recording of the fine grain stocks , the following were recommended by film manufacturers : ansco : fine grain positive for television purposes , for making direct positive recordings with 16 & nbsp ; mm kinescope cameras the problem of adapting the way the image is either displayed or captured on film , to get around the above , was solved in various different ways as time went on—improving the quality of the image it also prevented moiré patterns appearing when the resulting film was re-broadcast on television , which occurred if the line structure on the film recording did not precisely match the scanning lines of the electronic film scanner although some color telerecordings were made , they were generally in the minority as by the time color programs were widely needed for sale , video standards conversion was easier and higher quality and the price of videotape had become much reduced in the mid-90s , edie adams , wife of ernie kovacs , claimed that so little value was given to the kinescope recordings of the dumont television network that after the network folded in 1956 its entire archive was dumped into upper new york bay thumb kinescopes were intended to be used for immediate rebroadcast , or for an occasional repeat of a prerecorded program ; thus , only a small fraction of kinescope recordings remain today in the era before satellite communications , kinescopes were used to distribute live events such as a royal wedding as quickly as possible to other countries of the commonwealth that had started a television service it is not possible to accelerate the film fast enough to get it there in time without destroying the perforations in the film stock—and the larger the film gauge used , the worse the problem becomes another occasional use of telerecording into the late 1980s was by documentary makers working in 16 & nbsp ; mm film who wished to include a videotape-sourced excerpt in their work , although such use was again rare per his contract , he would receive one copy of each broadcast , which he kept in his vault , and only released them to the public ( on home video ) shortly before his death in 1987 telerecording was still being used internally at the bbc in the 1980s too , to preserve copies for posterity of programs which were not necessarily of the highest importance , but which nonetheless their producers wanted to be preserved before videotape became the exclusive transmission format during the early to mid-1980s , any ( color ) video recordings used in documentaries or filmed program inserts were usually transferred onto film although this episode was originally produced and broadcast in colour , the black & white film was the only surviving copy of the episode following the wiping of the original videotape
