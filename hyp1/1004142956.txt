there are similar compounds in cannabis that do not exhibit psychoactive response but are obligatory for functionality : cannabidiol ( cbd ) , an isomer of thc ; cannabivarin ( cbv ) , an analog of cannabinol ( cbn ) with a different side chain , cannabidivarin ( cbdv ) , an analog of cbd with a different side chain , and cannabinolic acid the thc molecule , and related compounds , are usually detectable in drug tests from 3 days up to 10 days according to redwood laboratories ; long-term users can produce positive tests for two to three months after ceasing cannabis use ( see drug test ) '' hospitals see rare vomiting syndrome in heavy marijuana consumers ) thc , the principal psychoactive constituent of the cannabis plant , has an extremely low toxicity and the amount that can enter the body through the consumption of cannabis plants poses no threat of death it is important though to note that cannabinoids and other molecules present in cannabis can alter the metabolism of other drugs , especially due to competition for clearing metabolic pathways such as cytochromes cyp450 , cannabinoids and cytochrome p450 interactions a 2007 study found that while tobacco and cannabis smoke are quite similar , cannabis smoke contained higher amounts of ammonia , hydrogen cyanide , and nitrogen oxides , but lower levels of carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) however , other studies have found much lower disparities in ammonia and hydrogen cyanide between cannabis and tobacco , and that some other constituents ( such as polonium-210 , lead , arsenic , nicotine , and tobacco-specific nitrosamines ) are either lower or non-existent in cannabis smoke a study by the british lung foundation published in 2012 identifies cannabis smoke as a carcinogen and also finds awareness of the danger is low compared with the high awareness of the dangers of smoking tobacco particularly among younger users other observations include possible increased risk from each cigarette ; lack of research on the effect of cannabis smoke alone ; low rate of addiction compared to tobacco ; and episodic nature of cannabis use compared to steady frequent smoking of tobacco when smoked , the short-term effects of cannabis manifest within seconds and are fully apparent within a few minutes , typically lasting for 1–3 hours , varying by the person and the strain of cannabis this agonist of the cannabinoid receptors results in changes in the levels of various neurotransmitters , especially dopamine and norepinephrine ; neurotransmitters which are closely associated with the acute effects of cannabis ingestion , such as euphoria and anxiety some effects may include a general altered state of consciousness , euphoria , feelings of well-being , relaxation or stress reduction , increased appreciation of the arts , including humor and music ( especially discerning its various components/instruments ) , joviality , metacognition and introspection , enhanced recollection ( episodic memory ) , increased sensuality , increased awareness of sensation , increased libido , and creativity cannabidiol ( cbd ) , another cannabinoid found in cannabis in varying amounts , has been shown to ameliorate the adverse effects of thc , including anxiety , that some consumers experience cannabis produces many other subjective effects , including an increased enjoyment of food taste and aroma , and marked cannabis and time perception ( where experiencing a '' rush '' of ideas can create the subjective impression of much time passing ) some of the short-term physical effects of cannabis use include increased heart rate , dry mouth , reddening of the eyes ( congestion of the conjunctival blood vessels ) , a reduction in intra-ocular pressure , muscle relaxation and a sensation of cold or hot hands and feet and / or flushed face in cannabis and driving : a review of the literature and commentary , the united kingdom 's department for transport reviewed data on cannabis and driving , finding although impaired , '' subjects under cannabis treatment appear to perceive that they are indeed impaired in a review of driving simulator studies , researchers note that '' even in those who learn to compensate for a drug 's impairing effects , substantial impairment in performance can still be observed under conditions of general task performance ( i.e department of transportation 's national highway traffic safety administration , it was found that other '' studies that measure the presence of thc in the drivers ' blood or oral fluid , rather than relying on self-report tend to have much lower ( or no ) elevated crash risk estimates on the other hand , a recent study of journal of transport & health indicated that the numbers of fatal crashes involving marijuana after the recreational marijuana legalization or decriminalization have significantly increased in colorado , washington , and massachusetts researchers reported in the international journal of cardiology , '' marijuana use by older people , particularly those with some degree of coronary artery or cerebrovascular disease , poses greater risks due to the resulting increase in catecholamines , cardiac workload , and carboxyhemoglobin levels , and concurrent episodes of profound postural hypotension such complications demonstrate the need for studies on cannabis that have stronger controls , and investigations into alleged symptoms of cannabis use that may also be caused by tobacco some critics question whether agencies doing the research make an honest effort to present an accurate , unbiased summary of the evidence , or whether they '' cherry-pick '' their data to please funding sources which may include the tobacco industry or governments dependent on cigarette tax revenue ; others caution that the raw data , and not the final conclusions , are what should be examined the feeling of increased appetite following the use of cannabis has been documented for hundreds of years , and is known colloquially as '' the munchies '' in the english-speaking world cannabinoids and feeding : the role of the endogenous cannabinoid system as a trigger for newborn suckling women and cannabis : medicine , science , and sociology , 2002 the haworth press , inc most microorganisms found in cannabis only affect plants and not humans , but some microorganisms , especially those that proliferate when the herb is not correctly dried and stored , can be harmful to humans the fungi aspergillus flavus , aspergillus fumigatus , aspergillus niger , aspergillus parasiticus , aspergillus tamarii , aspergillus sulphureus , aspergillus repens , mucor hiemalis ( not a human pathogen ) , penicillium chrysogenum , penicillium italicum and rhizopus nigricans have been found in moldy cannabis exposure to marijuana may have biologically-based physical , mental , behavioral , and social health consequences and is '' associated with diseases of the liver ( particularly with co-existing hepatitis c ) , lungs , heart , eyesight , and vasculature '' according to a 2013 literature review by gordon and colleagues cannabis dependence is defined in the fifth revision of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders ( dsm-5 ) as a condition requiring treatment cannabis consumption in pregnancy might be associated with restrictions in growth of the fetus , miscarriage , and cognitive deficits in offspring based on animal studies , although there is limited evidence for this in humans at this time a 2012 systematic review found although it was difficult to draw firm conclusions , there was some evidence that prenatal exposure to cannabis was associated with '' deficits in language , attention , areas of cognitive performance , and delinquent behavior in adolescence '' cannabis use and psychosis from national drug and alcohol research centre , australia provision of marijuana and other compounds for scientific research recommendations of the national institute on drug abuse national advisory council scientific american magazine ( december 2004 issue ) the brain 's own marijuana ramström , j ( 2003 ) , adverse health consequences of cannabis use , a survey of scientific studies published up to and including the autumn of 2003 , national institute of public health , sweden , stockholm the national cannabis prevention and information centre ( australia ) eu research paper on the potency of cannabis ( 2004 ) cannabis and mental health information leaflet from mental health charity the royal college of psychiatrists
