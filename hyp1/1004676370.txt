recumbents can be categorized by their wheelbase , wheel sizes , steering system , faired or unfaired , and front-wheel or rear-wheel drive long-wheelbase ( lwb ) models have the pedals located between the front and rear wheels ; short-wheelbase ( swb ) models have the pedals in front of the front wheel ; compact long-wheelbase ( clwb ) models have the pedals either very close to the front wheel or above it the rear wheel of a recumbent is usually behind the rider and may be any size , from around to the 700c ( or 27 '' on some older models , as on upright road bikes of that time ) of an upright racing cycle the front wheel is commonly smaller than the rear , although a number of recumbents feature dual 26-inch ( iso 559 ) , iso 571 ( 650c ) , iso 622 ( 700c ) , or even 29 x 4 '' oversize all-terrain tires given the higher rolling resistance of the smaller front wheel , loss of steering and control are somewhat more likely attempting sharp or quick changes of direction while crossing over patches of loose dirt , sand or pebbles high-racer aficionados also claim that they are more stable , and although it is easier to balance a bicycle with a higher center of mass , the wide variety of recumbent designs makes such generalizations unreliable the small front wheel and large rear wheel combination is used to keep the pedals and front wheel clear of each other , avoiding the problem on a short wheelbase recumbent called '' heel strike '' ( where the rider 's heels catch the wheel in tight turns ) oss/ass is generally direct—the steerer acts on the front fork like a standard bicycle handlebar—but the bars themselves may extend well behind the front wheel ( more like a tiller ) ; alternatively the bars might have long rearward extensions ( sometimes known as superman or kingcycle bars ) most recumbents have the cranks attached to a boom fixed to the frame , with a long drive chain for rear wheel drive however , due to the proximity of the crank to the front wheel , front wheel drive ( fwd ) can be an option , and it allows for a much shorter chain in addition to the much shorter chain , the advantages to pbfwd are use of a larger front wheel for lower rolling resistance without heel strike ( you can pedal while turning ) and use of the upper body when sprinting or climbing because of their longer wheelbase and the manner in which the rider is confined to the seat , recumbents are not as easy to use on tight , curving unpaved singletrack the extreme reclined position , and the fact that the rider is sitting in line with the wheels rather than atop them , makes this type the most aerodynamic of unfaired recumbents this necessitates a higher bottom bracket than on a lowracer so that the rider 's legs are above the front wheel , and this in turn requires a higher seat there are also hybrid recumbent designs such as the hase pino allround that utilize a recumbent stoker in the front , and an upright pilot in the rear recumbent cycles offer the possibility of combined hand and foot power inputs , and thus the potential for a full-body workout , and the option for persons with a weak or missing leg ( s ) to power a cycle in one recumbent tricycle design the user makes the two front wheels change direction by shifting his center of weight , and moves forward by rotating the rear wheel there are also hybrids between a handcycle , a recumbent bike and a tricycle ; these bikes enable cycling by use of legs , despite a spinal cord injury patent applications for a number of recumbent designs exist in the late years of the 19th century , and there were discussions in the cycling press of the relative merits of different layouts the early models of mochet 's 'la bicyclette de l'avenir ' ( the bicycle of the future ) , the 'vélo-vélocar ' , or ' v-v ' as the factory referred to them , used a 40mm steel-tube , single-beam frame and 450 x 55 wheels with handlebars over the rider and steering torque transmitted by bevel gears to demonstrate the speed of his recumbent bicycle , mochet had the design ratified by the uci and uvf and enlisted cyclist francis faure , a category 2 racer , to ride it in races when the union cycliste internationale ( uci ) met in february 1934 , manufacturers of 'upright ' bicycles lobbied to have faure 's one-hour record declared invalid on 1 april 1934 , the uci published a new definition of a racing bicycle that specified how high the bottom bracket could be above the ground , how far it could be in front of the seat and how close it could be to the front wheel charles mochet died a short time after the ban was enacted , still protesting against the uci decision , and the firm continued to make recumbents under his widow and , later , georges mochet until at least 1941 for a limited number of customers in 1938 , faure and mochet 's son , georges , began adding fairings to the velocar in hopes of bettering the world record of one hour for a bicycle with aerodynamic components in 1974 , they also nucleated the international human power speed championship in long beach , california , from which the ihpva grew the european scene was more dominated by competition than was the us , with the result that european bikes are more likely to be low swb machines , while lwb are much more popular in the us ( although there have been some notable european lwb bikes , such as the peer gynt ) a study by bussolari and nadel ( 1989 ) led them to pick a recumbent riding position for the daedalus flight even though the english channel crossing was accomplished in the gossamer albatross with an upright position three of the largest recumbent manufacturers in the us went out of business after the 1990s , including bikee ( august 2002 ) , atp-vision ( early 2004 ) and burley design cooperative ( september 2006 ) a number of records are recognised , the fastest of which is the '' flying 200 m '' , a distance of 200 & nbsp ;
