on tacking , the foresail would be dipped behind the mast to set on the other side , and the halyard ( which was made fast at the gunwale to help support the mast ) and burton ( a moveable stay ) would be shifted to windward and hauled taught again , whilst others would be heaving bags of shingle ballast to the new windward side of the bilge working craft of this type include the later versions of the falmouth quay punt - and interest in this local type were taken by dixon kemp , an authority on yacht racing , in 1875 these companies are known to have existed at the start of the 18th century and yawls operated right through the 19th century , until steam power , efficient tugs and lifeboats put the last of them out of business by the start of the 20th century the size of an individual yawl would vary depending on the size of the ship to which she belonged - though the yawl was usually the smallest of the various boats carried ) british and european racing yachts were rigged as yawls from the second half of the 1870s , with a resurgence in popularity from 1896 , when a change to the handicap rating system gave advantages to yawls ( single handed circumnavigator ) used a mizzen staysail on his yawl lively lady but did not set a mizzen - he felt it was of little value ( and it would interfere with the hasler self-steering gear ) whilst the earlier boats had three lug-rigged masts , in common with other types of british lugger , from the middle of the 19th century the mainmast was usually dispensed with to give a dipping lug foresail and a standing lug mizzen it appears that the norwegian boatbuilders built specific types of craft to meet the needs of the shetland market , as these boats differed somewhat from the ones used in norway if worked under oar , a yawl would have 10 or more oars a side - though the beach companies usually operated a gig in light weather if delivering or collecting a pilot , as they were faster under oars most were operated from a beach or a small harbour , with the boat being hauled out of the water when not in use the number of oars depended on the size of the boat , 8 and 6 being common , with some rowed by just 4 oars , generally , a yawl is a double-ended , clinker built open boat , which can be worked under sail or oar until the 19th century , most of these boats were built in norway and then transported to shetland disassembled , where they were put back together again the mizzen sheeted to an outrigger ( called an '' outligger '' by the crews of these boats )
