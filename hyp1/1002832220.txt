mary 's magnificat , recorded only in luke 's gospel , is one of four hymns , distilled from a collection of early jewish-christian canticles , which complement the promise-fulfillment theme of luke 's nativity of jesus the third stanza again demonstrates parallelism , but in this instance , three contrasting parallels : the proud are reversed by the low estate , the mighty by those of low degree , and the rich by the hungry although there is some scholarly discussion of whether the historical mary herself actually proclaimed this canticle , luke portrays her as the singer of this song of reversals and the interpreter of the contemporary events taking place along with the benedictus , as well as several old testament canticles , the magnificat is included in the book of odes , an ancient liturgical collection found in some manuscripts of the septuagint in a style reminiscent of old testament poetry and song , mary praises the lord in alignment with this structure : mary rejoices that she has the privilege of giving birth to the promised messiah : glory be to the father , and to the son , and to the holy ghost , : as it was in the beginning is now , and ever shall be , world without end : glory to the father , and to the son , and to the holy spirit , : as it was in the beginning , is now , and will be for ever in eastern orthodox worship , the ode of the theotokos is accompanied by the following refrain sung between the verses ( a sticheron ) and a megalynarion , which is the second part of the axion estin hymn : : τὴν τιμιωτέραν τῶν χερουβὶμ καὶ ἐνδοξοτέραν ἀσυγκρίτως τῶν σεραφίμ , τὴν ἀδιαφθόρως θεὸν λόγον τεκοῦσαν , τὴν ὄντως θεοτόκον , σὲ μεγαλύνομεν : ( 'you who are more to be honoured than the cherubim and incomparably more glorious than the seraphim , you who , uncorrupted , gave birth to god the word , in reality the god-bearer , we exalt you the text forms a part of the daily office in the roman catholic vespers service , the lutheran vespers service , and the anglican services of evening prayer , according to both the book of common prayer and common worship in orthodox liturgical practice , the magnificat is always sung during the matins service before the irmos of the ninth ode of the canon as the magnificat is part of the sung vespers , many composers , beginning in the renaissance , set the words to music , for example claudio monteverdi in his vespro della beata vergine ( 1610 ) henri dumont , marc-antoine charpentier , 10 settings ( h.72 , h.73 , h.74 , h.75 , h.76 , h.77 , h.78 , h.79 , h.80 , h.81 ) , vivaldi composed a setting of the latin text for soloists , choir , and orchestra , as did johann sebastian bach in his magnificat ( 1723 , rev the '' mag and nunc '' has been set by many composers – such as thomas tallis , ralph vaughan williams , herbert sumsion , charles wood and john tavener – of anglican church music , often for choir a cappella or choir and organ an eastern orthodox setting of the magnificat ( text in latin and english ) is to be found in the 2011 all-night vigil ( section 11 ) by the english composer clive strutt the oratorio laudato si ' composed in 2016 by peter reulein on a libretto by helmut schlegel includes the full latin text of the magnificat , expanded by writings of clare of assisi , francis of assisi and pope francis
