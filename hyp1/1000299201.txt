the key elements of the hpa axis are : the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus , which contains neuroendocrine neurons which synthesize and secrete vasopressin and corticotropin-releasing hormone ( crh ) acth in turn acts on : the adrenal cortex , which produces glucocorticoid hormones ( mainly cortisol in humans ) in response to stimulation by acth important to the function of the hpa axis are some of the feedback loops : cortisol produced in the adrenal cortex will negatively feedback to inhibit both the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland release of corticotropin-releasing hormone ( crh ) from the hypothalamus is influenced by stress , physical activity , illness , by blood levels of cortisol and by the sleep/wake cycle ( circadian rhythm ) the hpa axis has a central role in regulating many homeostatic systems in the body , including the metabolic system , cardiovascular system , immune system , reproductive system and central nervous system a number of cytokines , such as il-1 , il-6 , il-10 and tnf-alpha can activate the hpa axis , although il-1 is the most potent the hpa axis in turn modulates the immune response , with high levels of cortisol resulting in a suppression of immune and inflammatory reactions the cns is in many ways '' immune privileged '' , but it plays an important role in the immune system and is affected by it in turn when the hpa axis is activated by stressors , such as an immune response , high levels of glucocorticoids are released into the body and suppress immune response by inhibiting the expression of proinflammatory cytokines ( e.g il-4 , il-10 , and il-13 ) in immune cells , such as monocytes and neutrophils the relationship between chronic stress and its concomitant activation of the hpa axis , and dysfunction of the immune system is unclear ; studies have found both immunosuppression and hyperactivation of the immune response the hpa axis is involved in the neurobiology of mood disorders and functional illnesses , including anxiety disorder , bipolar disorder , insomnia , posttraumatic stress disorder , borderline personality disorder , adhd , major depressive disorder , burnout , chronic fatigue syndrome , fibromyalgia , irritable bowel syndrome , and alcoholism particularly in rodents , it has been shown that females may lack the ability to tolerate as well as process stress ( particularly for chronic stress ) due to possible down regulation of gr expression as well as a deficiency of fkbp51 binding protein in the cytosol stressors can be of many different types—in experimental studies in rats , a distinction is often made between '' social stress '' and '' physical stress '' , but both types activate the hpa axis , though via different pathways there is evidence that an increase in oxytocin , resulting for instance from positive social interactions , acts to suppress the hpa axis and thereby counteracts stress , promoting positive health effects such as wound healing serotonin ( 5ht ) appeared to be the active neurotransmitter involved in mediating stress responses , and increases in serotonin are related to increased blood α-msh levels , which causes skin darkening ( a social signal in salmonoid fish ) , activation of the hpa axis , and inhibition of aggression the drug ly354740 ( also known as eglumegad , an agonist of the metabotropic glutamate receptors 2 and 3 ) has been shown to interfere in the hpa axis , with chronic oral administration of this drug leading to markedly reduced baseline cortisol levels in bonnet macaques ( macaca radiata ) ; acute infusion of ly354740 resulted in a marked diminution of yohimbine-induced stress response in those animals studies on people show that the hpa axis is activated in different ways during chronic stress depending on the type of stressor , the person 's response to the stressor and other factors stressors that are uncontrollable , threaten physical integrity , or involve trauma tend to have a high , flat diurnal profile of cortisol release ( with lower-than-normal levels of cortisol in the morning and higher-than-normal levels in the evening ) resulting in a high overall level of daily cortisol release in humans , prolonged maternal stress during gestation is associated with mild impairment of intellectual activity and language development in their children , and with behaviour disorders such as adhd , schizophrenia , anxiety and depression ; self-reported maternal stress is associated with a higher irritability , emotional and attentional problems in one widely replicated experiment , rats subjected to the moderate stress of frequent human handling during the first two weeks of life had reduced hormonal and behavioral hpa-mediated stress responses as adults , whereas rats subjected to the extreme stress of prolonged periods of maternal separation showed heightened physiological and behavioral stress responses as adults there may be a critical period during development during which the level of stress hormones in the bloodstream contribute to the permanent calibration of the hpa axis first , maternal care is crucial in maintaining the normal stress hypo responsive period ( shrp ) , which in rodents , is the first two weeks of life during which the hpa axis is generally non-reactive to stress maintenance of the shrp period may be critical for hpa development , and the extreme stress of maternal separation , which disrupts the shrp , may lead to permanent hpa dysregulation schechter ds , moser da , paoloni-giacobino a , stenz a , gex-fabry m , aue t , adouan w , cordero mi , suardi f , manini a , sancho rossignol a , merminod g , ansermet f , dayer ag , rusconi serpa s ( epub may 29 , 2015 ) a blunted acth response is common in depression , so the authors of this work posit that this pattern is likely to be due to the participant 's depression and not their exposure to early life stress heim and colleagues have proposed that early life stress , such as childhood abuse , can induce a sensitization of the hpa axis , resulting in particular heightened neuronal activity in response to stress-induced crf release the predictive adaptation hypothesis ( 1 ) , the three-hit concept of vulnerability and resilience ( 2 ) and the maternal mediation hypothesis ( 3 ) attempt to elucidate how early life adversity can differentially predict vulnerability or resilience in the face of significant stress in later life ( 1 ) the predictive adaptation hypothesis : this hypothesis is in direct contrast with the diathesis stress model , which posits that the accumulation of stressors across a lifespan can enhance the development of psychopathology once a threshold is crossed the predictability of these epigenetic changes is not definitive , however – depending primarily on the degree to which the individual 's genetic and epigenetically modulated phenotype “ matches ” or “ mismatches ” with his/her environment ( see : hypothesis ( 2 ) ) the hpa axis plays a clear role in the production of corticosteroids , which govern many facets of brain development and responses to ongoing environmental stress fleeing ) , the mobilization of energy , learning ( in the face of novel , dangerous stimuli ) as well as increased appetite for biochemical energy storage
