lift is commonly associated with the wing of an aircraft , although lift is also generated by rotors on rotorcraft ( which are effectively rotating wings , performing the same function without requiring that the aircraft move forward through the air ) essentially an extreme form of ballistic flight , spaceflight is the use of space technology to achieve the flight of spacecraft into and through outer space air propulsion ( except in gliders ) lift , created by the reaction to an airflow drag , created by aerodynamic friction weight , created by gravity buoyancy , for lighter than air flight these forces must be balanced for stable flight to occur in the context of an air flow relative to a flying body , the lift force is the component of the aerodynamic force that is perpendicular to the flow direction aerodynamic lift is created by the motion of an aerodynamic object ( wing ) through the air , which due to its shape and angle deflects the air a spaceflight typically begins with a rocket launch , which provides the initial thrust to overcome the force of gravity and propels the spacecraft from the surface of the earth the largest birds , the ostrich and the emu , are earthbound flightless birds , as were the now-extinct dodos and the phorusrhacids , which were the dominant predators of south america in the cenozoic era air safety is a term encompassing the theory , investigation and categorization of flight failures , and the prevention of such failures through regulation , education and training for a solid object moving through a fluid , the drag is the component of the net aerodynamic or hydrodynamic force acting opposite to the direction of the movement '' it is a dimensionless parameter characteristic of rockets and other jet engines and of vehicles propelled by such engines ( typically space launch vehicles and jet aircraft ) hypersonic flight is very high speed flight where the heat generated by the compression of the air due to the motion through the air causes chemical changes to the air the techniques used for navigation in the air will depend on whether the aircraft is flying under the visual flight rules ( vfr ) or the instrument flight rules ( ifr ) the only groups of flying and gliding animals are birds , insects , and bats , while many groups have evolved gliding 5 r v^2 ) the beginner 's guide to aeronautics - nasa glenn research center lift-to-drag ratios for practical aircraft vary from about 4:1 for vehicles and birds with relatively short wings , up to 60:1 or more for vehicles with very long wings , such as gliders these machines include aircraft such as airplanes , gliders , helicopters , autogyros , airships , balloons , ornithopters as well as spacecraft in aircraft , successful air navigation involves piloting an aircraft from place to place without getting lost , breaking the laws applying to aircraft , or endangering the safety of those on board or on the earth supersonic flight is associated with the formation of shock waves that form a sonic boom that can be heard from the ground , bern , peter the wind resistance caused by the craft moving through the air is called drag and is overcome by air propulsion except in the case of gliding this can be done in several ways including by the spinning blades of a propeller , or a rotating fan pushing air out from the back of a jet engine , or by ejecting hot gases from a rocket engine in an airplane , lift is created by the wings ; the shape of the wings of the airplane are designed specially for the type of flight desired aerodynamic lift results when the wing causes the surrounding air to be deflected - the air then causes a force on the wing in the opposite direction , in accordance with newton 's third law of motion an aerostat is a system that remains aloft primarily through the use of buoyancy to give an aircraft the same overall density as air the beginner 's guide to aeronautics - nasa glenn research center the lift coefficient cl is equal to the lift l divided by the ( density r times half the velocity v squared times the wing area a ) quote : '' thrust-to-weight ratio f/w 0 is a dimensionless parameter that is identical to the acceleration of the rocket propulsion system ( expressed in multiples of g0 ) if it could fly by itself in a gravity free vacuum george cayley studied flight scientifically in the first half of the 19th century , and in the second half of the 19th century otto lilienthal made over 200 gliding flights and was also one of the first to understand flight scientifically by contrast , aerodynes primarily use aerodynamic lift , which requires the lateral movement of at least some part of the aircraft through the surrounding air mass a guidance system is a device or group of devices used in the navigation of a ship , aircraft , missile , rocket , satellite , or other moving object 5 r v^2 ) the lift coefficient is also affected by the compressibility of the air , which is much greater at higher speeds , so velocity v is not a linear function a conventional fixed-wing aircraft flight control system consists of flight control surfaces , the respective cockpit controls , connecting linkages , and the necessary operating mechanisms to control an aircraft 's direction in flight the range that powered flight articles can achieve is ultimately limited by their drag , as well as how much energy they can store on board and how efficiently they can turn that energy into propulsion insect flight makes use of either of two basic aerodynamic models : creating a leading edge vortex , found in most insects , and using clap and fling , found in very small insects such as thrips the three critical flight dynamics parameters are the angles of rotation in three dimensions about the vehicle 's center of mass , known as pitch , roll and yaw ( see tait-bryan rotations for an explanation ) many human cultures have built devices that fly , from the earliest projectiles such as stones and spears , '' archytas of tar entum the beginner 's guide to aeronautics - nasa glenn research center the drag coefficient cd is equal to the drag d divided by the ( density r times half the velocity v squared times the reference area a ) because lift and drag are both aerodynamic forces , the ratio of lift to drag is an indication of the aerodynamic efficiency of the airplane the wings of the flying vertebrate groups are all based on the forelimbs , but differ significantly in structure ; those of insects are hypothesized to be highly modified versions of structures that form gills in most other groups of arthropods
