it is especially found in warmer climates , such as the caribbean , hawaii , japan , and australia , where up to 70 % of individuals in a population have fp fibropapillomatosis is a benign tumour disease of marine turtles , predominantly in the green sea turtle , chelonia mydas , but it has also been reported in the loggerhead sea turtle caretta caretta , olive ridley lepidochelys olivacea , kemp 's ridley lepidochelys kempii , and leatherbacks dermochelys coriacea immunosuppression is strongly correlated with fp , but does seem to be a consequence of the development and growth of fp rather than a prerequisite , which is similar to other virus-induced tumour diseases in other species , such as marek 's disease in poultry an alphaherpesvirus initially called fibropapilloma-associated turtle herpesvirus ( fpthv ) , and now called chelonid alphaherpesvirus 5 , is believed to be the causative agent of the disease fp is most often found externally around the armpits , genitals , neck , eyes , and tails of turtles , but also occur in and around the mouth , and rarely in internal organs or on the carapace even so , observations support the hypothesis that near-shore habitats have a strong correlation with the disease , as newly recruited individuals from the pelagic life phase have never been found with tumours , and when migrating to more shallow ocean zones , such as the neritic zone , individuals still remain free from fp , but when entering lagoon systems , turtles may become infected again , causality has not been concluded , but an association seems to exist between the distribution of especially the dinoflagellates and the occurrence of fp , and as they are found on weeds , they can be ingested by foraging green sea turtles the leech genus ozobranchus is thought to be the mechanical vector of the herpesvirus , transmitting the virus from one turtle to another they have higher phagocytic leucocyte counts ( especially heterophils ) compared to healthy individuals , which seems to be an effect of fp , as it is mostly evident in individuals with severe tumours
