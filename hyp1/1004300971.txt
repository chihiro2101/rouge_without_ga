the falls was an important and sacred site to the mdewakanton sioux and they called the mississippi river , hahawakpa , '' river of the falls '' the falls ( haha ) themselves were given specific names , mnirara '' curling waters '' , owahmenah '' falling waters '' , or owamni , '' whirlpool '' ( mniyomni in the eastern dakota dialect and owamniyomni in the teton dakota ( lakota ) dialect ) the sacred falls also enters into their oral tradition by a story of a warrior 's first wife who killed herself and their two children in anguish and forlorn love for the husband who had assumed a second wife since the cataract had to be portaged , the area became one of the natural resting and trade points along the mississippi between dakota and anishinaabe peoples the anishinaabe language term was recorded as '' kakabikah '' ( gakaabikaa , '' split rock '' or more descriptively , gichi-gakaabikaa , '' the great severed rock '' which referenced the jagged chunks of limestone constantly eroding by the falls ) in 1680 , the falls became known to the western world when they were observed and published in a journal by father louis hennepin , a catholic friar of belgian birth , who also first published about niagara falls to the world 's attention hennepin named them the chutes de saint-antoine or the falls of saint anthony after his patron saint , anthony of padua according to the john carter brown library , '' carver 's purpose was to map the land , to befriend the native americans , and to discover the northwest passage the bridge in the foreground is the third avenue bridge , behind it are the upper st anthony falls to the left and the upper lock and dam to the right , followed by the stone arch bridge further competition over the power of the falls on both banks of the river led to its eventual downfall when it partially collapsed in 1869 and was reinforced and subsequently sealed by a concrete overflow spillway ( or '' apron '' ) thumb the area around the river was added to the national register of historic places as the saint anthony falls historic district in 1971 which includes 8th avenue northeast extending downstream to 6th avenue southeast and approximately two city blocks on both shoreline the national significance of the saint anthony falls historic district is a major reason why the national park service 's mississippi national river and recreation area was established along the mississippi river in the minneapolis â€“ saint paul metropolitan area estimates are that the falls were about high when the river warren falls receded past the confluence of the mississippi river and the glacial river warren anthony , and steele was able to build his dam on the east side of the river above the falls , blocking the east channel by 1854 , 300 squatters occupied the west bank of the river , and in 1855 congress recognized the squatters ' right to purchase the land they had claimed they built a dam diagonally into the river to the north , which , along with steele 's dam created the inverted v-shape , still apparent today millers on the minneapolis side formed a consortium to extract power by diverting upper-level water into waterwheel-equipped vertical shafts ( driven through the limestone bedrock into the soft , underlying sandstone ) and then through horizontal tunnels to the falls ' lower level anthony ( east ) side of the river were less-well organized harnessing the power , and therefore industry developed at a slower pace on that side a report in 1868 found that only eleven hundred feet of the limestone remained upstream , and if it were eroded away , the falls would turn into a rapids that would no longer be useful for waterpower the next year , an engineer from lowell , massachusetts , recommended completing a wooden apron , sealing the tunnel , and building low dams above the falls to avoid exposing the limestone to the weather anthony falls was the head of navigation on the mississippi until two dams and a series of locks were built between 1948 and 1963 by the united states army corps of engineers the locks made commercial navigation possible above minneapolis but , since the locks in minneapolis are smaller than most of the locks on the rest of the river , the practical limit for many commercial tows was still further downriver anthony falls dam , completed in 1956 , is a gravity-type hydro-electric dam in height , consisting of a long concrete spillway with four tainter gates i-35w mississippi river bridge , which collapsed in 2007 and temporarily blocked the lower pool list of contributing properties in the st
