pyrrole is a colorless volatile liquid that darkens readily upon exposure to air , and is usually purified by distillation immediately before use common naturally produced molecules containing pyrroles include vitamin b12 , bile pigments like bilirubin and biliverdin , and the porphyrins of heme , chlorophyll , chlorins , bacteriochlorins , and porphyrinogens the biosynthesis of prodigiosin involves the convergent coupling of three pyrrole type rings ( labeled a , b , and c in figure 1 ) from l-proline , l-serine , l-methionine , pyruvate , and 2-octenal structural analogs of pyrrole include : pyrroline , a partially saturated analog with one double bond pyrrolidine , the saturated hydrogenated analog derivatives of pyrrole include indole , a derivative with a fused benzene ring pyrrole itself is not naturally occurring , but many of its derivatives are found in a variety of cofactors and natural products as a hydrogen bonding lewis acid it is classified as a hsab and the ecw model lists its acid parameters as e a 1.38 and c a 0.68 in the paal–knorr pyrrole synthesis , a 1,4-dicarbonyl compound reacts with ammonia or a primary amine to form a substituted pyrrole this fragment is then able to react with the masked carbanion formed from the plp mediated decarboxylation of l-serine , which cyclizes in a dehydration reaction to yield the second pyrrole ring unlike furan and thiophene , it has a dipole in which the positive end lies on the side of the heteroatom , with a dipole moment of 1.58 & nbsp ; d as is typical for electrophilic additions to pyrroles , halogenation generally occurs at the 2-position , but can also occur at the 3-position by silation of the nitrogen nitrophilic metals , such as mgx , lead to alkylation at c ( mainly c2 ) , due to a higher degree of coordination to the nitrogen atom the hantzsch pyrrole synthesis is the reaction of β-ketoesters ( 1 ) with ammonia ( or primary amines ) and α-haloketones ( 2 ) to give substituted pyrroles ( 3 ) its reactivity is similar to that of benzene and aniline , in that it is easy to alkylate and acylate the method involves the reaction of an α-aminoketone ( 1 ) and a compound containing a methylene group α to ( bonded to the next carbon to ) a carbonyl group ( 2 ) under acidic conditions , pyrroles polymerize easily , and thus many electrophile reagents that are used in benzene chemistry are not applicable to pyrroles for example , birch reduction of pyrrole esters and amides produced pyrrolines , with the regioselectivity depending on the position of the electron-withdrawing group ring a is synthesized from l-proline through the nonribosomal peptide synthase ( nrps ) pathway ( figure 2 ) , wherein the pyrrolidine ring of proline is oxidized twice through fad+ to yield pyrrole ring a the product is a pyrrole with substituents at the 3 and 4 positions this intermediate is then modified by methylation ( which incorporates a methyl group from l-methionine onto the alcohol at the 6 position ) and oxidation of the primary alcohol to the aldehyde to yield the core a-b ring structures due to its aromaticity , pyrrole is difficult to hydrogenate , does not easily react as a diene in diels–alder reactions , and does not undergo usual olefin reactions pyrrole is also weakly acidic at the n–h position , with a pk a of 16.5
