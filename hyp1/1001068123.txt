notably , the financial crisis inquiry commission ( fcic ) , tasked by congress with investigating the causes of the financial crisis , cited moral hazard as a component of the crisis , arguing that many factors , including deregulation in the derivatives market in 2000 , reduced federal oversight , and the potential for government bailout of '' too big to fail '' institutions all played a role in increasing moral hazard in the years leading up to the collapse a party makes a decision about how much risk to take , while another party bears the costs if things go badly , and the party insulated from risk behaves differently from how it would if it were fully exposed to the risk in insurance markets , moral hazard occurs when the behavior of the insured party changes in a way that raises costs for the insurer since the insured party no longer bears the full costs of that behavior in economic theory , moral hazard is a situation in which the behavior of one party may change to the detriment of another after the transaction has taken place rowell and connelly offer a detailed description of the genesis of the term moral hazard , d rowell , lb connelly ( 2012 ) “ a history of the term “ moral hazard ” ” journal of risk and insurance 79 ( 4 ) , 1051–75 by identifying salient changes in economic thought , which are identified within the medieval theological and probability literature thus , there is no one person responsible for verifying that any one particular loan is sound , that the assets securing that one particular loan are worth what they are supposed to be worth , that the borrower responsible for making payments on the loan can read and write the language in which the papers that he/she signed were written , or even that the paperwork exists and is in good order therefore , asset managers may have been in a situation of moral hazard , where they would take on more risk than appropriate for a given client because they did n't bear the cost of failure for example , after purchasing automobile insurance , some may tend to be less careful about locking the automobile or choose to drive more , thereby increasing the risk of theft or an accident for the insurer in the latter case , after the contract has been signed there is a random draw by nature that determines the agent 's type ( such as his valuation for a good or his costs of effort ) a second type of behavior that may change is the reaction to the negative consequences of risk once they have occurred and insurance is provided to cover their costs '' financial bailouts of lending institutions by governments , central banks or other institutions can encourage risky lending in the future if those that take the risks come to believe that they will not have to carry the full burden of potential losses many scholars and journalists have argued that moral hazard played a role in the 2008 financial crisis , since numerous actors in the financial market may have had an incentive to increase their exposure to risk for example , a person with insurance against automobile theft may be less cautious about locking their car because the negative consequences of vehicle theft are now ( partially ) the responsibility of the insurance company insured parties then do not behave in a more risky manner that results in more negative consequences , but they ask an insurer to pay for more of the negative consequences from risk as insurance coverage increases secondly , the agent may be risk-neutral but wealth-constrained and so the agent can not make a payment to the principal and there is a trade-off between providing incentives and minimizing the agent 's limited-liability rent in the former case , after the contract has been signed the agent chooses an action ( such as an effort level ) that can not be observed by the principal in the literature , two reasons have been discussed why moral hazard may imply that the first-best solution ( the solution that would be attained under complete information ) is not achieved for example , in the case of a health insurance company insuring an individual during a specific time period , the final health of the individual can be thought of as the outcome it also arises in banking and finance : if a financial institution knows it is protected by a lender of last resort , it may make riskier investments than it would in the absence of the protection '' too big to fail '' banks may have believed they were essentially invincible to failure , thus putting them in a position of moral hazard : they could take on big risks - thus increasing their expected payoff - thinking that the federal government would bail them out in the event of a major failure economists distinguish moral hazard from adverse selection , another problem that arises in the insurance industry , which is caused by hidden information , rather than hidden actions economists use this term to describe inefficiencies that can occur when risks are displaced or can not be fully evaluated , rather than a description of the ethics or morals of the involved parties if insurance companies could perfectly observe the actions of their clients , they could deny coverage to clients choosing risky actions ( like smoking in bed or not wearing seat belts ) , allowing them to provide thorough protection against risk ( fire or accidents ) without encouraging risky behavior moral hazard has been studied by insurers crosby was one of the founders of the national fire protection association , nfpa.org and academics ; such as in the work of kenneth arrow , tom baker , and john nyman therefore , large banks may have been in a situation of moral hazard , because they did n't bear the costs of a catastrophic collapse in a purely capitalist scenario , the last one holding the risk ( like a game of musical chairs ) is the one who faces the potential losses therefore , mortgage loan originators may have been in a situation of moral hazard , because they did n't bear the costs of the risky mortgages they were underwriting
