a comprehension of infrastructure spans not only these public works facilities , but also the operating procedures , management practices , and development policies that interact together with societal demand and the physical world to facilitate the transport of people and goods , provision of water for drinking and a variety of other uses , safe disposal of society 's waste products , provision of energy where it is needed , and transmission of information within and between communities the word is a combination of the latin prefix '' infra '' , meaning '' below '' , as many of these constructions are underground ( for example , tunnels , water and gas systems , and railways ) , and the french word '' structure '' ( derived from the latin word '' structure '' ) 2017 infrastructure report , 112pp , american society of civil engineers , 2017 they grade 16 categories , namely aviation , bridges , dams , drinking water , energy , hazardous waste , inland waterways , levees , parks and recreation , ports , rail , roads , schools , solid waste , transit and wastewater both rain gardens and bioswales mitigate flood impacts and prevent stormwater from polluting local waterways ; increase the usable water supply by reducing the amount of water needed for outdoor irrigation ; improve air quality by minimizing the amount of water going into treatment facilities , which also reduces energy usage and , as a result , reduces air pollution since less greenhouse gases are emitted green infrastructure has become an increasingly popular strategy in recent years due to its effectiveness in providing ecological , economic , and social benefits -- including positively impacting energy consumption , air quality , and carbon reduction and sequestration one benefit of green roofs is that they reduce stormwater runoff because of its ability to store water in its growing media , reducing the runoff entering the sewer system and waterways , which also decreases the risk of combined sewer overflows masdar city is located in a desert region , meaning that sustainable collection and distribution of water is dependent on the city ’ s ability to utilize water at innovative stages of the water cycle another benefit is that they reduce energy usage since the growing media provides additional insulation , reduces the amount of solar radiation on the roof ’ s surface , and provides evaporative cooling from water in the plants , which reduce the roof surface temperatures and heat influx in a more practical sense , it refers to a decentralized network of stormwater management practices , which includes green roofs , trees , bioretention and infiltration , and permeable pavement some individuals have referred to this planned settlement as “ utopia-like ” , due to the fact that it will feature multiple sustainable infrastructure elements , including energy , water , waste management , and transportation this article will explore many aspects of infrastructure , including classification , applications , related concepts , ownership and financing , the developing world , and its sustainable future the word infrastructure has been used in french since 1875 and in english since 1887 , originally meaning '' the installations that form the basis for any operation or system '' urban resilience is defined by a city ’ s capacity to quickly adapt or recover from infrastructure defects , and infrastructure reliability means that systems must work efficiently while continuing to maximize their output & nbsp ; both specific functional modes – highways , streets , roads , and bridges ; mass transit ; airports and airways ; water supply and water resources ; wastewater management ; solid-waste treatment and disposal ; electric power generation and transmission ; telecommunications ; and hazardous waste – and the combined system these modal elements comprise the army use of the term achieved currency in the united states after the formation of nato in the 1940s , and by 1970 was adopted by urban planning in its modern civilian sense
