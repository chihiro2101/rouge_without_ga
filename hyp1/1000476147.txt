after reentering the pelvis , it accompanies the internal pudendal artery and internal pudendal vein upwards and forwards along the lateral wall of the ischiorectal fossa , being contained in a sheath of the obturator fascia termed the pudendal canal , along with the internal pudendal blood vessels inside the pudendal canal , the nerve divides into branches , first giving off the inferior rectal nerve , then the perineal nerve , before continuing as the dorsal nerve of the penis ( in males ) or the dorsal nerve of the clitoris ( in females ) the pudendal nerve supplies sensation to the penis in males , and to the clitoris in females , which travels through the branches of both the dorsal nerve of the penis and the dorsal nerve of the clitoris by providing sensation to the penis and the clitoris , the pudendal nerve is responsible for the afferent component of penile erection and clitoral erection branches also innervate muscles of the perineum and the pelvic floor ; namely , the bulbospongiosus and the ischiocavernosus muscles respectively , the levator ani muscle ( including the iliococcygeus , pubococcygeus , puborectalis and either pubovaginalis in females or puboprostaticus in males ) the external anal sphincter ( via the inferior anal branch ) , and male or female external urethral sphincter a pudendal anesthesia , also known as a saddle nerve block , is a local anesthesia technique used in an obstetric procedure to anesthetize the perineum during labor the nerve may then be injected with cortisone and local anesthetic to confirm and also treat chronic pain of the external genitalia ( known as vulvodynia in females ) , pelvic and anorectal pain the pudendal canal is also known by the eponymous term '' alcock 's canal '' , after benjamin alcock , an irish anatomist who documented the canal in 1836 alcock documented the existence of the canal and pudendal nerve in a contribution about iliac arteries in robert bentley todd 's '' the cyclopaedia of anatomy and physiology '' file : gray829.png the male pelvis , showing the pudendal nerve ( centre right ) file : grant 1962 214.png schematic showing the structures innervated by the pudendal nerve file : grant 1962 215.png diagram of the course of the pudendal nerve in the male pelvis
