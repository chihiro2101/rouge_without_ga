in contrast , bird-pollinated flowers tend to be red or orange the acacia ant ( pseudomyrmex ferruginea ) is an obligate plant ant that protects at least five species of '' acacia '' ( vachellia ) from preying insects and from other plants competing for sunlight , and the tree provides nourishment and shelter for the ant and its larvae '' at the school of architecture , planning and landscape , newcastle university , a coevolutionary approach to architecture has been defined as a design practice that engages students , volunteers and members of the local community in practical , experimental work aimed at '' establishing dynamic processes of learning between users and designers firstly , flowers communicate with their pollinators by scent ; insects use this scent to determine how far away a flower is , to approach it , and to identify where to land and finally to feed ( 2020 ) reveals a prevailing scarcity in explaining what processes substantially characterize coevolution in these fields , meaning that specific analyses about where this perspective on socio-economic change is , and where it could move toward in the future , are still missing he first mentioned coevolution as a possibility in on the origin of species , and developed the concept further in fertilisation of orchids ( 1862 ) more formally , then , the geographic mosaic of coevolution can be viewed as a genotype by genotype by environment interaction ( gxgxe ) that results in the relentless evolution of interacting species '' valeur later argued that : '' as we become more and more interconnected and interdependent , human development is no longer a matter of the evolution of individual groups of people but rather a matter of the co-evolution of all people both intraspecific competition , with features such as sexual conflict and sexual selection , and interspecific competition , such as between predators , may be able to drive coevolution when detrimental , natural selection will favor evolutionary responses in the host population , resulting in a coevolutionary hotspot of ongoing reciprocal evolutionary changes in the parasite and host populations their eggs are camouflaged as eggs of their hosts , implying that hosts can distinguish their own eggs from those of intruders and are in an evolutionary arms race with the cuckoo between camouflage and recognition by creating a framework for collaboration between academics and professionals representing two distinct cultures , it was hoped that the exchange of knowledge , ideas and experiences would stimulate '' creativity and imagination to set the spark for new visions for sustainable urban development alternatively , an interaction between two or more species may be antagonistic in some environments but mutualistic ( beneficial to both or all species ) in other environments in development betrayed : the end of progress and a coevolutionary revisioning of the future ( 1994 ) richard norgaard proposes a coevolutionary cosmology to explain how social and environmental systems influence and reshape each other the genus ficus is composed of 800 species of vines , shrubs , and trees , including the cultivated fig , defined by their syconiums , the fruit-like vessels that either hold female flowers or pollen on the inside these birds do not make their own nests , but lay their eggs in nests of other species , ejecting or killing the eggs and young of the host and thus having a strong negative impact on the host 's reproductive fitness the exhibition included urban planning projects for the cities of beijing , chongqing , shanghai , and xi'an , which had been developed in collaboration between young professional danish architects and architecture students and professors and students of architecture from the four chinese cities each of the two subfamilies of hummingbirds , the phaethornithinae ( hermits ) and the trochilinae , has evolved in conjunction with a particular set of flowers
