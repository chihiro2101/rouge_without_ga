if used properly , it allowed the stored bits to be pushed down the tape and pop off the end , forming a type of delay line memory , but one where the propagation of the fields was under computer control , as opposed to automatically advancing at a set rate defined by the materials used five significant discoveries took place at bell labs : the controlled two-dimensional motion of single wall domains in permalloy films the application of orthoferrites the discovery of the stable cylindrical domain the invention of the field access mode of operation the discovery of growth-induced uniaxial anisotropy in the garnet system and the realization that garnets would be a practical material the bubble system can not be described by any single invention , but in terms of the above discoveries the next problem was to make them move to the proper location where they could be read back out : twistor was a wire and there was only one place to go , but in a 2d sheet things would not be so easy the bubble system required a '' warm-up '' time of about 85 seconds ( prompted by a timer on the screen when switched on ) before the game was loaded , as bubble memory needs to be heated to around to operate properly one interesting side-effect of the twistor concept was noticed in production ; under certain conditions , passing a current through one of the electrical wires running inside the tape would cause the magnetic fields on the tape to move in the direction of the current in fact , it seemed that bubble memory would soon be the only form of memory used in the vast majority of applications , with the high-performance market being the only one they could not serve the bubble logic would use nanotechnology and has been demonstrated to have access times of 7 & nbsp ; ms , which is faster than the 10 & nbsp ; ms access times that present hard drives have , though it is slower than the access time of traditional ram and of traditional logic circuits , making the proposal not commercially practical at present the memory density of twistor was a function of the size of the wires ; the length of any one wire determined how many bits it held , and many such wires were laid side-by-side to produce a larger memory system by the early 1980s , however , bubble memory technology became a dead end with the introduction of hard disk systems offering higher storage densities , higher access speeds , and lower costs bubble memory found uses in niche markets through the 1980s in systems needing to avoid the higher rates of mechanical failures of disk drives , and in systems operating in high vibration or harsh environments with orthoferrite , if the patch was written and then a magnetic field was applied to the entire material , the patch would shrink down into a tiny circle , which he called a bubble this led to the possibility of making a memory system similar to the moving-domain twistor concept , but using a single block of magnetic material instead of many twistor wires liebmann memorial award by the ieee with the following citation : for the concept and development of single-walled magnetic domains ( magnetic bubbles ) , and for recognition of their importance to memory technology when a small magnetic field was applied , they would become magnetized , and the bubbles would '' stick '' to one end
