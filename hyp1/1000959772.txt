based on the fluctuations of the horizon area , a quantum black hole exhibits deviations from the hawking spectrum that would be observable were x-rays from hawking radiation of evaporating primordial black holes to be observed based on lqg , the theory states that as stars are collapsing into black holes , the energy density reaches the planck energy density , causing a repulsive force that creates a star loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) is a symmetry-reduced model of classical general relativity quantized using methods that mimic those of loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) that predicts a '' quantum bridge '' between contracting and expanding cosmological branches however , the results obtained are subject to the usual restriction that a truncated classical theory , then quantized , might not display the true behaviour of the full theory due to artificial suppression of degrees of freedom that might have large quantum fluctuations in the full theory it has been argued that singularity avoidance in lqc are by mechanisms only available in these restrictive models and that singularity avoidance in the full theory can still be obtained but by a more subtle feature of lqg no spacetime is assumed a priori , but rather it is built up by the states of theory themselves – however scattering amplitudes are derived from n -point functions ( correlation function ) and these , formulated in conventional quantum field theory , are functions of points of a background space-time the relation between the background-independent formalism and the conventional formalism of quantum field theory on a given spacetime is far from obvious , and it is far from obvious how to recover low-energy quantities from the full background-independent theory one would like to derive the n -point functions of the theory from the background-independent formalism , in order to compare them with the standard perturbative expansion of quantum general relativity and therefore check that loop quantum gravity yields the correct low-energy limit a strategy for addressing this problem has been suggested ; the idea is to study the boundary amplitude , namely a path integral over a finite space-time region , seen as a function of the boundary value of the field in conventional quantum field theory , this boundary amplitude is well–defined and codes the physical information of the theory ; it does so in quantum gravity as well , but in a fully background–independent manner a generally covariant definition of n -point functions can then be based on the idea that the distance between physical points –arguments of the n -point function is determined by the state of the gravitational field on the boundary of the spacetime region considered in a 2003 paper '' a dialog on quantum gravity '' , carlo rovelli regards the fact lqg is formulated in 4 dimensions and without supersymmetry as a strength of the theory as it represents the most parsimonious explanation , consistent with current experimental results , over its rival string/m-theory proponents of string theory will often point to the fact that , among other things , it demonstrably reproduces the established theories of general relativity and quantum field theory in the appropriate limits , which loop quantum gravity has struggled to do many of these problems apply to lqg , including : can quantum mechanics and general relativity be realized as a fully consistent theory ( perhaps as a quantum field theory ) ? is spacetime fundamentally continuous or discrete ? would a consistent theory involve a force mediated by a hypothetical graviton , or be a product of a discrete structure of spacetime itself ( as in loop quantum gravity ) ? are there deviations from the predictions of general relativity at very small or very large scales or in other extreme circumstances that flow from a quantum gravity theory ? the theory of lqg is one possible solution to the problem of quantum gravity , as is string theory on the other hand , the consequences of lqg are radical , because they fundamentally change the nature of space and time and provide a tentative but detailed physical and mathematical picture of quantum spacetime other technical problems include finding off-shell closure of the constraint algebra and physical inner product vector space , coupling to matter fields of quantum field theory , fate of the renormalization of the graviton in perturbation theory that lead to ultraviolet divergence beyond 2-loops ( see one-loop feynman diagram in feynman diagram ) while there has been a proposal relating to observation of naked singularity , and doubly special relativity as a part of a program called loop quantum cosmology , there is no experimental observation for which loop quantum gravity makes a prediction not made by the standard model or general relativity ( a problem that plagues all current theories of quantum gravity )
