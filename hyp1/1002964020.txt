they inform the public of the threatened status of endangered species and of those factors which cause the threat , with the hope of creating public interest in stopping and reversing those factors which jeopardize a species ' survival in the first place this technique is similar to a field gene bank in that plants are maintained in the ambient environment , but the collections are typically not as genetically diverse or extensive a potential technique for aiding in reproduction of endangered species is interspecific pregnancy , implanting embryos of an endangered species into the womb of a female of a related species , carrying it to term the target population size is the number of individuals that are required to maintain appropriate levels of genetic diversity , which is generally considered to by 90 % of the current genetic diversity after 100 years minimizing the loss of genetic diversity within the captive population is an important component of ex situ conservation and is critical for successful reintroductions and the long term success of the species , since more diverse populations have higher adaptive potential the loss of genetic diversity due to the founder effect can be minimized by ensuring that the founder population is large enough and genetically representative of the wild population this is often difficult because removing large numbers of individuals from the wild populations may further reduce the genetic diversity of a species that is already of conservation concern minimizing selection on captive populations by creating an environment that is similar to their natural environment is another method of reducing adaptations to captivity , but it is important to find a balance between an environment that minimizes adaptation to captivity and an environment that permits adequate reproduction in large , outcrossing populations , the frequencies of most deleterious alleles are relatively low , but when a population undergoes a bottleneck during the founding of a captive population , previously rare alleles may survive and increase in number in the process of eliminating genetic disorders , it is important to consider that when certain individuals are prevented from breeding , alleles and therefore genetic diversity are removed from the population ; if these alleles are n't present in other individuals , they may be lost completely the wollemi pine is another example of a plant that is being preserved via ex situ conservation , as they are being grown in nurseries to be sold to the general public it is to be used as a last resort , or as a supplement to in situ conservation because it can not recreate the habitat as a whole : the entire genetic variation of a species , its symbiosis counterparts , or those elements which , over time , might help a species adapt to its changing surroundings instead , ex situ conservation removes the species from its natural ecological contexts , preserving it under semi-isolated conditions whereby natural evolution and adaptation processes are either temporarily halted or altered by introducing the specimen to an unnatural habitat the downside to this is that , when re-released , the species may lack the genetic adaptations and mutations which would allow it to thrive in its ever-changing natural habitat furthermore , ex situ conservation techniques are often costly , with cryogenic storage being economically infeasible in most cases since species stored in this manner can not provide a profit but instead slowly drain the financial resources of the government or organization determined to operate them diseases and pests foreign to the species , to which the species has no natural defense , may also cripple crops of protected plants in ex situ plantations and in animals living in ex situ breeding grounds these factors , combined with the specific environmental needs of many species , some of which are nearly impossible to recreate by man , make ex situ conservation impossible for a great number of the world 's endangered flora and fauna african wild dog conservancy animal husbandry artificial insemination asiatic cheetah captive breeding cloning conservation biology convention on biological diversity cryoconservation of animal genetic resources de extinction embryo transfer endangered species intracytoplasmic sperm injection introduced species in vitro fertilisation iucn red list list of animals that have been cloned list of introduced species pleistocene park reintroduction wildlife conservation world conservation union ( iucn ) cloning to revive extinct species , may 28 , 2002 , grant holloway , cnn reproductive technologies and conservation of endangered cats louisiana 's frozen ark online book : '' in situ conservation of livestock and poultry '' , 1992 , food and agriculture organization of the united nations and the united nations environment programme '' the challenges of ex situ orchid conservation '' , orchid conservation coalition botanic gardens conservation international â€“ international organisation supporting ex-situ conservation of priority plant species domestic animal diversity information system implementing the global plan of action for animal genetic resources
