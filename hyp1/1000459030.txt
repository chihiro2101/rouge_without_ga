floaters are from objects in pockets of liquid within the vitreous humour , the thick fluid or gel that fills the eye , or between the vitreous and the retina however , attempting to shift one 's gaze toward them can be difficult because floaters follow the motion of the eye , remaining to the side of the direction of gaze although the blood vessels of the eye also obstruct light , they are invisible under normal circumstances because they are fixed in location relative to the retina , and the brain '' tunes out '' stabilized images through neural adaptation despite the name '' floaters '' , many of these specks have a tendency to sink toward the bottom of the eyeball , in whichever way the eyeball is oriented ; the supine position ( looking up or lying back ) tends to concentrate them near the fovea , which is the center of gaze , while the textureless and evenly lit sky forms an ideal background against which to view them however , floaters are more than a nuisance and a distraction to those with severe cases , especially if the spots seem constantly to drift through the field of vision the shapes are shadows projected onto the retina by tiny structures of protein or other cell debris discarded over the years and trapped in the vitreous humour or between the vitreous and retina it is not , however , only elderly persons who are troubled by floaters ; they can also become a problem to younger people , especially if they are myopia during this detachment , the shrinking vitreous can phosphene , causing the patient to see random flashes across the visual field , sometimes referred to as '' flashers '' , a symptom more formally referred to as photopsia the ultimate release of the vitreous around the optic nerve head sometimes makes a large floater appear , usually in the shape of a ring ( '' weiss ring '' ) posterior vitreous detachment is more common in people who : are nearsighted ; have undergone cataract surgery ; have had nd : yag laser surgery of the eye ; have had inflammation inside the eye patients with retinal tears may experience floaters if red blood cells are released from leaky blood vessels , and those with uveitis or vitritis , as in toxoplasmosis , may experience multiple floaters and decreased vision due to the accumulation of white blood cells in the vitreous humour however , if the floater is near the retina , it may not be visible to the observer even if it appears large to the patient the presence of retinal tears with new onset of floaters was surprisingly high ( 14 % ; 95 % confidence interval , 12–16 % ) as reported in a meta-analysis published as part of the rational clinical examination series in the journal of the american medical association of these small gauge instruments , one is an infusion port to resupply a saline solution and maintain the pressure of the eye , the second is a fiber optic light source , and the third is a vitrector like most invasive surgical procedures , however , vitrectomy carries a risk of complications , including : retinal detachment , anterior vitreous detachment and macular edema – which can threaten vision or worsen existing floaters ( in the case of retinal detachment ) in this procedure an ophthalmic laser ( usually a yttrium aluminium garnet ( yag ) laser ) applies a series of nanosecond pulses of low-energy laser light to evaporate the vitreous opacities and to sever the vitreous strands as a result , they often provide a limited view of the vitreous , which can make it difficult to identify the targeted floaters and membranes
