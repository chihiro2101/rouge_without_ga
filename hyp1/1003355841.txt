million , to be paid for by east riding county council and lindsey county council sir ralph freeman had produced the first ideas in 1927 and in the early 1930s the cost of the project was estimated at £1.725 & nbsp ; million and that the bridge would be unlikely to recoup the construction or maintenance costs the bill would have made amendments to the act of 1959 '' requiring the secretary of state to give directions to members of the humber bridge board regarding healthcare and to review the possibility of facilitating journeys across the humber bridge in relation to healthcare '' even though the bill received cross-party support ( it was co-sponsored by shadow home secretary david davis and supported by all other mps representing north lincolnshire and the east riding of yorkshire ) it ran out of time later that year the aim was to allow patients travelling between the banks for medical treatment to cross without paying the toll and to allow the secretary of state for transport to appoint two members of the board to represent the interests of the nhs in october 2009 , the government approved a £6 & nbsp ; million grant for maintenance costs , which meant that there would be no toll increase before 2011 at the earliest , by which time tolls would have been frozen for five years in the first phase , the toll booths and the toll plaza canopy were replaced and in the second phase writing , testing and setting up the new toll system was completed plans were announced on 26 december 2009 to construct a suicide barrier along the walkways of the bridge ; design constraints were cited as the reason for not installing barriers during the construction of the bridge to reduce heat of hydration in the concrete , which produces calcium silicate hydrate from belite , as much as 60 per cent of the portland cement was replaced with ground granulated blast-furnace slag ( ggbs ) a protest at the bridge on 1 september 2007 was supported by the local cancer patients involvement group , the road haulage association , yorkshire and the humber mep diana wallis and local business and council representatives much of the interest on the debt was suspended and deferred in a refinancing which saw no write off – the balance was to be paid using tolls the government responded to the petition on 14 january 2008 , stating that '' concessions or exemptions from tolls on the humber bridge are a matter for the humber bridge board '' the journey was along straight single-carriageway roads across foggy moors interrupted by bottlenecks for most of the journey to blyth , nottinghamshire , where it met the a1 , and the accident rate was high the southern foundations were completed in september 1975 , with the pier completed in march 1976 and the southern tower was completed by september 1976 ; the bridge had been planned to open in 1976
