the global average and combined land and ocean surface temperature , show a warming of 0.85 0.65 to 1.06 °c , in the period 1880 to 2012 , based on multiple independently produced datasets ipcc ar5 wg1 chapter 2 p193 the ipcc fourth assessment report found that the instrumental temperature record for the past century included urban heat island effects but that these were primarily local , having a negligible influence on global temperature trends ( less than 0.006 & nbsp ; °c per decade over land and zero over the oceans ) in january 2017 , several scientific agencies around the world , including nasa and the noaa in the united states and the met office in the united kingdom , named 2016 the warmest year recorded '' peter stott , acting director of the met office , noted the influence of the el niño event on 2016 temperatures but also stated that '' the main contributor to warming over the last 150 years is human influence on climate from increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere '' tim osborn , director of research at the university of east anglia 's climatic research unit , agreed stating that '' multiple lines of independent evidence confirm that the planet has warmed over the last 150 years : warmer oceans , warmer land , warmer lower atmosphere and melting ice '' based on the noaa dataset ( note that other datasets produce different rankings the following table lists the global combined land and ocean annually averaged temperature rank and anomaly for each of the 10 warmest years on record the earth 's average surface absolute temperature for the 1961–1990 period has been derived by spatial interpolation of average observed near-surface air temperatures from over the land , oceans and sea ice regions , with a best estimate of 14 & nbsp ; °c ( 57.2 & nbsp ; °f ) the temperature data for the record come from measurements from land stations and ships the scientific consensus is reflected , for example , by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ( ipcc ) , an international body which summarizes existing science , and the u.s the methods used to derive the principal estimates of global surface temperature trends—hadcrut3 , noaa and nasa/giss—are largely independent the preliminary results of an assessment carried out by the berkeley earth surface temperature group and made public in october 2011 , found that over the past 50 years the land surface warmed by 0.911 & nbsp ; °c , and their results mirrors those obtained from earlier studies carried out by the noaa , the hadley centre and nasa 's giss ) '' including urban heat island effect , '' poor '' station quality , and the '' issue of data selection bias '' and found that these effects did not bias the results obtained from these earlier studies internal climate variability is a result of complex interactions between components of the climate system , such as the coupling between the atmosphere and ocean edited quote from public-domain source : the area of cooler-than-average sea surface temperatures that defines la niña conditions can push global temperatures downward , if the phenomenon is strong enough temperature trends from 1901 are positive over most of the world 's surface except for atlantic ocean south of greenland , the southeastern united states , and parts of bolivia since 1979 temperature increase is considerably stronger over land while cooling has been observed over some oceanic regions in the pacific ocean and southern hemisphere ; the spatial pattern of ocean temperature trend in those regions is possibly related to the pacific decadal oscillation and antarctic oscillation seasonal temperature trends are positive over most of the globe but weak cooling is observed over the mid latitudes of the southern ocean but also over eastern canada in spring because of strengthening of the north atlantic oscillation warming is stronger over northern europe , china and north america in winter , europe and asia interior in spring , europe and north africa in summer and northern north america , greenland and eastern asia in autumn enhanced warming over north eurasia is partly linked to the arctic oscillation , while in the southern hemisphere the trend toward stronger westerlies over the southern ocean favoured a cooling over much of antarctica with the exception of the antarctic peninsula where strong westerlies decrease cold air outbreaks from the south temperature trends in the lower atmosphere – understanding and reconciling differences the satellite records used to show much smaller warming trends for the troposphere which were considered to disagree with model prediction ; however , following revisions to the satellite records , the trends are now similar the ipcc fifth assessment report concluded '' assessment of the large body of studies comparing various long-term radiosonde and msu products since ar4 is hampered by data set version changes , and inherent data uncertainties brooks investigated historical climate network ( ushcn ) sites in indiana in 2005 , and assigned 16 % of the sites an 'excellent ' rating , 59 % a 'good ' rating , 12.5 % a 'fair ' rating , and 12.5 % 'poor ' rating '' another study that same year documented examples of well and poorly sited monitoring stations in the united states , including ones near buildings , roadways , and air conditioning exhausts another study concluded in 2006 , that existing empirical techniques for validating the local and regional consistency of temperature data are adequate to identify and remove biases from station records , and that such corrections allow information about long-term trends to be preserved national oceanic and atmospheric administration ( noaa ) maintains the global historical climatology network ( ghcn-monthly ) data base containing historical temperature , precipitation , and pressure data for thousands of land stations worldwide also , noaa 's national climatic data center ( ncdc ) ncdc state of the climate global analysis , april 2010 of surface temperature measurements maintains a global temperature record since 1880 trends in global temperatures since january 1979 ( the beginning of the satellite temperature record ) , measured in degrees celsius per decade , at as 31 october 2019 : instrumental record : noaa : +0.171 giss ( nasa ) : +0.185 hadcrut ( uk met office ) : +0.171 berkeley ( air ) : +0.188 berkeley ( water ) : +0.165 jma ( japan ) : +0.138 satellite record : rss : +0.206 uah : +0.130
