when the railway branch line was built , a bridge over the canal was made , and this bridge can still be seen , showing the alignment of the canal at its lower termination the canal ran broadly north , following closely the course of the river itself , for a distance of , terminating at moorswater , in the valley to the west of liskeard the canal ran on the east side of the river , except between a point below plashford bridge to near landreast bridge , the present day railway branch line closely follows the route of the canal when the railway line was built in 1860 , the canal gradually fell into disrepair , and is shown as '' disused '' on 1882 ordnance survey maps , ordnance survey , 25 inch plans , cornwall and the isles of scilly , 1882 although the short southern section to sandplace continued in use for several years priestley , published in 1831 , described the canal : the liskeard and looe canal commences at tarras pill , and proceeds from thence in a northerly direction to the parish of liskeard terminating at moorswater , ] above the level of the sea there was a wharf at sandplace ( sand place ) but it was immediately adjacent to the main line of the canal ; messenger points out that a quay was dug into the river bank at sandplace to serve a kiln , and priestley was misled into thinking that this was a branch of the canal ; actually it was the main river while the coastal shipping element of the journey was straightforward , even main roads were in a primitive condition ; for example : despite its grand title , it would seem that the 'royal cornish way ' ( today 's a30 ) was little better than a muddy cart-track by the beginning of the 18th century to get to liskeard above the navigable river , the means of transport was on the backs of horses : the first wheeled wagon was introduced into the liskeard district in 1790 the idea for a canal to liskeard was first investigated in 1777 when edmund leach and '' a gentleman from liskeard '' proposed a canal which would run between banka mill , west of liskeard , and sandplace , to the north of looe on the east looe river green prepared plans for a bill , and the necessary act of parliament was obtained on 22 june 1825 , but after green 's departure , the proprietors asked robert coad to design the route in detail the act created the liskeard and looe union canal company , with an authorised capital of £13,000 in shares of £25 , and authority to borrow a further £10,000 on mortgage if required it also allowed feed water to be taken from the river looe and the '' crylla rivulet '' ; but there were restrictions on the latter , so '' that no injury may be done to the navigation of the fowey , of which river the crylla is a tributary stream '' there was some internal tension in the committee of management , for there was a motion at the general meeting in february 1826 that a properly qualified civil engineer should be asked to assess the work done so far , and whether the two men should be allowed to proceed without further assistance , but the motion was defeated by 49 votes to 10 , and four of the nine committee members changed at the subsequent election the canal had been planned to run on the west side of the river towards looe , but a landowner , mr eliot , was holding out for excessive compensation for his land , and the construction was transferred to the east side over the affected length , in the lands of john buller , to by-pass eliot 's land the canal vastly increased the facility of bringing lime and sea sand to the agricultural hinterland above liskeard ; in addition coal was brought for lime burning and for domestic use moving the minerals by pack horse was expensive and inconvenient , and the liskeard and caradon railway was promoted to bring the ore to moorswater ; the canal company made room at their terminal for the railway this not only brought about transfer of the transportation from other routes to the benefit of the canal , but it encouraged further exploration and mineral extraction , which then further augmented carrying on the canal there were also concerns about the adequacy of the water supply with the increased use of the locks , and there was considerable friction between the company and millers higher up the east looe valley over use of water at the later date , the canal was working at capacity , and the transshipment at moorswater from rail to canal was costing from 4d to 6d per ton ; because of congestion on the canal , trade was being lost to competing routes via calstock and st germans ; and the twenty-four locks caused the journey to be slow and cumbersome although there was some opposition from buller 's son , also called john , and from the admiralty , who were concerned about navigation on the river , the duchy of cornwall helped the company to obtain its authorising act of parliament , the liskeard and looe railway act , which was granted on 11 may 1858 sandplace continued to be a significant wharf for the canal , due to the activities of john buller , but it appears that the canal above that point , although not actually displaced by the railway construction , was positively allowed to decline although the canal was still officially open , the liskeard water company negotiated the takeover of the crylla leat and its water supply from may 1861 , subsequently agreeing to pay £5 per year for its perpetual use the upper section may have been used by the tenants of the morval estate for the transport of agricultural produce , for which no tolls were chargeable , but residents at duloe complained in 1867 that the canal could no longer be used since the railway had been built the liskeard and caradon railway closed in 1917 but the liskeard and looe railway still operates , with passenger trains on the line being marketed under the brand name '' the looe valley line ''
