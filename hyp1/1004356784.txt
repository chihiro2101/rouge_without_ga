these codified laws may coexist with or contradict other forms of social control , such as religious proscriptions , professional rules and ethics , or the cultural mores and customs of a society the purpose of criminal law is to provide the specific definition of what constitutes a crime and to prescribe punishments for committing such a crime the subject of criminal justice is , of course , primarily concerned with the enforcement of criminal law the criminal-justice system consists of three main parts : law enforcement agencies , usually the police courts and accompanying prosecutor and defence lawyers agencies for detaining and supervising offenders , such as prisons and probation agencies in the criminal justice system , these distinct agencies operate together as the principal means of maintaining the rule of law within society the first contact a defendant has with the criminal justice system is usually with the police ( or law enforcement ) who investigates the suspected wrongdoing and makes an arrest , but if the suspect is dangerous to the whole nation , a national level law enforcement agency is called in when warranted , law enforcement agencies or police officers are empowered to use force and other forms of legal coercion and means to effect public and social order the term is most commonly associated with police departments of a state that are authorized to exercise the police power of that state within a defined legal or territorial area of responsibility the first police force comparable to the present-day police was established in 1667 under king louis xiv in france , although modern police usually trace their origins to the 1800 establishment of the thames river police in london , the glasgow police , and the napoleonic police of paris these include the judge , prosecutor , and the defense attorney the judge , or magistrate , is a person , elected or appointed , who is knowledgeable in the law , and whose function is to objectively administer the legal proceedings and offer a final decision to dispose of a case the case should be decided in favor of the party who offers the most sound and compelling arguments based on the law as applied to the facts of the case although both serve the function of bringing a complaint before the court , the prosecutor is a servant of the state who makes accusations on behalf of the state in criminal proceedings , while the plaintiff is the complaining party in civil proceedings the accused , not the lawyer , has the right to make final decisions regarding a number of fundamental points , including whether to testify , and to accept a plea offer or demand a jury trial in appropriate cases it is the defense attorney 's duty to represent the interests of the client , raise procedural and evidentiary issues , and hold the prosecution to its burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt some nations , such as america , allow plea bargaining in which the accused pleads guilty , nolo contendere or not guilty , and may accept a diversion program or reduced punishment , where the prosecution 's case is weak or in exchange for the cooperation of the accused against other people any prejudice on the part of the lawyers , the judge , or jury members threatens to destroy the court 's credibility '' manipulations of the court system by defense and prosecution attorneys , law enforcement as well as the defendants have occurred and there have been cases where justice was denied early on , when civilizations lacked the resources necessary to construct and maintain prisons , exile and execution were the primary forms of punishment religious institutions also have a presence in many prisons , with the goal of teaching ethics and instilling a sense of morality in the prisoners the functional study of criminal justice is distinct from criminology , which involves the study of crime as a social phenomenon , causes of crime , criminal behavior , and other aspects of crime it emerged as an academic discipline in the 1920s , beginning with berkeley police chief august vollmer who established a criminal justice program at the university of california , berkeley in 1916 until the 1960s , the primary focus of criminal justice in the united states was on policing and police science the warren court ( the supreme court under chief justice earl warren ) , issued a series of rulings which redefined citizen 's rights and substantially altered the powers and responsibilities of police and the courts over time , scholars of criminal justice began to include
