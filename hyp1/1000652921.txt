other pathways including the stress response pathways jak-stat and p38 , nutritional signalling via foxo , and jnk cell death signalling are all involved in key physiological responses to infection the cellular immune response instead refers to the direct activity of blood cells ( hemocytes ) in drosophila , which are analogous to mammalian monocytes/macrophages this core group of genes is associated with gene ontology categories such as antimicrobial response , stress response , secretion , neuron-like , reproduction , and metabolism among others as a result , the fruit fly offers a useful model of innate immunity for disentangling genetic interactions of signalling and effector function , as flies do not have to contend with interference of adaptive immune mechanisms that could confuse results various genetic tools , protocols , and assays make drosophila a classical model for studying the innate immune system , which has even included immune research on the international space station upon infection , pro-spatzle is cleaved by the protease spe ( spatzle processing enzyme ) to become active spatzle , which binds to the toll receptor located on the cell surface of the fat body and dimerizes for activation of downstream nf-κb signaling pathways , including multiple death domain containing proteins and negative regulators such as the ankyrin repeat protein cactus it has been proposed that a second spe-like enzyme similarly acts to activate spatzle , as loss of spe does not completely reduce the activity of toll signalling , however no second spe has yet been identified the imd pathway is orthologous to human tnf receptor superfamily signalling , and is triggered by gram-negative bacteria through recognition by peptidoglycan recognition proteins ( pgrp ) including both soluble receptors and cell surface receptors ( pgrp-le and lc , respectively ) imd signalling culminates in the translocation of the nf-κb transcription factor relish into the nucleus , leading to the upregulation of imd-responsive genes including the amp diptericin jak-stat induction leads to the production of a number of stress response proteins including thioester-containing proteins ( teps ) , turandots , and the putative antimicrobial peptide listericin however drosophila hemocytes do not renew over the adult lifespan , and so the fly has a finite number of hemocytes that decrease over the course of its lifespan work over the following 30 years has shown that these mutations ( and others like them ) affect a group of genes and their products that form a biochemical or circadian rhythm this clock is found in a wide range of fly cells , but the clock-bearing cells that control activity are several dozen neurons in the fly 's central brain since then , benzer and others have used behavioral screens to isolate genes involved in vision , olfaction , audition , learning/memory , courtship , pain , and other processes , such as longevity males distinguish between conspecific males and females and direct persistent courtship preferentially toward females thanks to a female-specific sex pheromone which is mostly produced by the female 's tergites ) were isolated by william '' chip '' quinn while in benzer 's lab , and were eventually shown to encode components of an intracellular signaling pathway involving cyclic amp , protein kinase a , and a transcription factor known as creb male flies sing to the females during courtship using their wings to generate sound , and some of the genetics of sexual behavior have been characterized in particular , the fruitless gene has several different splice forms , and male flies expressing female splice forms have female-like behavior and vice versa '' homosexuality turned on and off in fruit flies '' flies use a modified version of bloom filters to detect novelty of odors , with additional features including similarity of novel odor to that of previously experienced examples , and time elapsed since previous experience of the same odor rna-seq from fly mutants displaying over-aggressive behaviors found more than 50 auditory-related genes ( important for transient receptor potentials , calcium signaling , and mechanoreceptor potentials ) to be upregulated in the ab neurons located in johnston 's organ other than hearing , another sensory modality that regulates aggression is pheromone signaling , which operates through either the olfactory system or the taste depending on the pheromone an example is cva , an anti-aphrodisiac pheromone used by males to mark females after copulation and to deter other males from mating the r7 and r8 cells express a combination of either rh3 or rh4 , which absorb uv light ( 345 & nbsp ; nm and 375 & nbsp ; nm ) , and rh5 or rh6 , which absorb blue ( 437 & nbsp ; nm ) and green ( 508 & nbsp ; nm ) light , respectively however , in vertebrates , the g protein is transducin , while the g protein in invertebrates is gq ( dgq in drosophila ) plcβ hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol ( 4,5 ) -bisphosphate ( pip 2 ) , a phospholipid found in the cell membrane , into soluble inositol triphosphate ( ip 3 ) and diglyceride ( dag ) , which stays in the cell membrane dag or a derivative of dag causes a calcium-selective ion channel known as transient receptor potential ( trp ) to open and calcium and sodium flows into the cell ip 3 is thought to bind to ip 3 receptors in the subrhabdomeric cisternae , an extension of the endoplasmic reticulum , and cause release of calcium , but this process does not seem to be essential for normal vision these proteins interact with other proteins and have been shown to be necessary for shut off of the light response for example , disruption of the interaction between inac , the protein kinase c , and inad results in a delay in inactivation of the light response this means that grooming behaviors that occur at the beginning of the sequence prevent those that come later in the sequence from occurring simultaneously , as the grooming sequence consists of mutually exclusive behaviors at fast walking speeds ( 15–30 & nbsp ; mm/s ) , the walking configuration is mostly tripod ( 3 legs in stance ) , but at low walking speeds ( 0–15 & nbsp ; mm/s ) , flies are more likely to have four or five legs in stance in addition to stability , the robustness of a walking gait is also thought to be important in determining the gait of a fly at a particular walking speed characteristics of drosophila flight may be dominated by the viscosity of the air , rather than the inertia of the fly body , but the opposite case with inertia as the dominant force may occur however , subsequent work showed that while the viscous effects on the insect body during flight may be negligible , the aerodynamic forces on the wings themselves actually cause fruit flies ' turns to be damped viscously the name and behavior of this species of fly has led to the misconception that it is a biological security risk in australia
