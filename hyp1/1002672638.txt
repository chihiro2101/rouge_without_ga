d'israeli was born in cento , near ferrara , then part of the papal states , on 22 september 1730 , the son of isaac israeli although his grandson later wrote of the family 's roots in the republic of venice , it seems the family 's only connection with that city was through these sisters , for the only records of the family in the archives of the venetian ghetto are of venturina 's death there in 1821 and of the death of rachel in the register for 1837 lord beaconsfield , in the memoir of his father , speaks of an elder brother of benjamin , who was a banker in venice and a friend of sir horace mann , but according to wolf ( 1902 ) this must be a mistake , for apart from the absence of any record of this brother , and of any mention of him in the minute and copious correspondence of mann , the fact that rachel and venturina israeli kept a girls ' school in the ghetto makes it very unlikely that they had a banker brother lucien wolf ( 1902 & ndash ; 5 ) , the disraeli family , transactions and miscellanies of the jewish historical society of england , vol 5 , pp.202 & ndash ; 218 of isaac israeli is noteworthy that he bore a name honoured in jewry and that he married into a family of great antiquity and of considerable renown in ferrara it is not unlikely ( according to wolf ) , in view of the rarity of his patronymic , that he was of the family of the famous philosopher and court physician isaac israeli ben solomon of kairouan , who flourished in the tenth century , but this can only be conjectured his wife , rica or eurichetta rossi , was , however , unquestionably of the ancient family of min-haadumin , which traced its origin to one of the jews led into captivity after the siege of jerusalem ( 70 ) by titus and vespasian , and , at a later date , translated its hebrew name into its literal italian equivalent , '' dei rossi '' the min-haadumin were numerous in ferrara , where isaac israeli spent his life , and it was in the capital of the former duchy that the most illustrious of the clan , azaria dei rossi , practised as a physician and wrote his remarkable cyclop√¶dia of bible criticism , meor enayim , in the latter half of the sixteenth century from letters preserved by one of benjamin israeli 's great-grandchildren , it is clear that the attraction which brought him to these shores had much less to do with the stability of the dynasty in great britain , by which lord beaconsfield has characteristically accounted for his migration , than with a humdrum , but entirely creditable , desire to find the best market for his knowledge of the straw hat trade the bride was sarah shiprut de gabay villareal , younger daughter of a prosperous city merchant , isaac syprut , whose mother had been a villareal , and whose wife , esther , was sister-in-law to simon calimani , then chief rabbi of venice he remained a member of the stock exchange until 1803 , when he retired from business ; but to the day of his death he retained an address at tom 's coffee house , and was often seen in cornhill , dabbling in stocks and shares
