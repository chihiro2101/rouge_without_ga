they bought out the dearne and dove canal in 1846 , and acquired the sheffield canal from the manchester , sheffield and lincolnshire railway in 1848 , which , as the sheffield and lincolnshire junction railway , a predecessor and constituent company , had bought it in 1846 today the system is open to navigation throughout the main line , the stainforth and keadby and new junction canals , and is mostly used for leisure boating doncaster lock was extended in 1909 and 1910 , and improvements were made at doncaster , rotherham and tinsley , but trade declined significantly with the onset of the first world war , as many of the steam trawlers which had previously used coal from the waterway were requisitioned by the admiralty , and were fuelled elsewhere the dutch river was difficult to navigate , and in 1793 , the stainforth and keadby canal was authorised , to provide a link from the don at stainforth to the trent at keadby the estimated cost for these improvements was £1,483,426 , but the economic circumstances of the time meant that the government was not prepared to support the scheme , and whereas the neighbouring corporation of nottingham funded improvements to the river trent without government support , sheffield were not prepared to do the same for the don the intent was to rebuild the don and the stainforth and keadby routes to allow 300- or 400-ton barges to be used , and to develop coal-handling facilities at keadby so that it would rival goole on the aire and calder navigation the dearne and dove canal was also authorised in 1793 , from swinton to barnsley , and was again under don navigation control , since most of the shareholders were also shareholders in the don the new company obtained an act of parliament on 26 august 1889 , creating the sheffield and south yorkshire navigation company , which was authorised to raise £1.5 & nbsp ; million and to purchase the four canals either by negotiation , or by compulsory purchase if after nine months negotiations with the railway company had failed to reach an agreement it underwent major changes in the 1620s , when cornelius vermuyden closed the channel which crossed hatfield chase to reach the river trent at adlingfleet , and diverted all of the water northwards to the river aire meanwhile , negotiations had also taken place with the aire and calder , and an agreement had been reached to connect the two systems together by a canal , so that the improved don could use goole for the export of coal , rather than having to develop keadby in addition , the dearne and dove canal would be dredged , so that tom pudding , like those on the aire and calder , could be used for the transport of coal by the 1880s , there was dissatisfaction among the users that the rates for traffic were higher than on the railways , and the canals were failing to modernise , as steam boats were banned , despite them having been in use for 50 years on the neighbouring aire and calder navigation the sheffield and south yorkshire canal company limited was formed in november 1888 , with a capital of £30,000 , to promote this new venture and obtain the necessary act of parliament they were also faced with the prospect of funding their half of the new junction canal , to provide the connection with the aire and calder navigation the estimated cost of this work , which included a new canal from tinsley to sheffield , but did not include buying the canals from the railway company , was put at £1 & nbsp ; million
