sickert was born in munich , germany , on 31 may 1860 , the eldest son of oswald sickert , a danish-german artist , and his wife , eleanor louisa henry , who was an illegitimate daughter of the british astronomer richard sheepshanks though he was the son and grandson of painters , he first sought a career as an actor ; he appeared in small parts in sir henry irving 's company , before taking up the study of art in 1881 in the late 1880s he spent much of his time in france , especially in dieppe , which he first visited in mid-1885 , and where his mistress , and possibly his illegitimate son , lived between 1894 and 1904 sickert made a series of visits to venice , initially focusing on the city 's topography ; it was during his last painting trip in 1903–04 that , forced indoors by inclement weather , he developed a distinctive approach to the multiple-figure tableau that he further explored on his return to britain 47 sickert 's fascination with urban culture accounted for his acquisition of studios in working-class sections of london , first in cumberland market in the 1890s , then in camden town in 1905 for several years sickert had already been painting lugubrious female nudes on beds , and continued to do so , deliberately challenging the conventional approach to life painting— '' the modern flood of representations of vacuous images dignified by the name of 'the nude ' represents an artistic and intellectual bankruptcy '' —giving four of them , which included a male figure , the title the camden town murder , and causing a controversy which ensured attention for his work at the same time sickert founded , with other artists , the camden town group of british painters , named from the district of london in which he lived it was influenced by post-impressionism and expressionism , but concentrated on scenes of often drab suburban life ; sickert himself said he preferred the kitchen to the drawing room as a scene for paintings after the death of his second wife in 1920 , sickert relocated to dieppe , where he painted scenes of casinos and café life until his return to london in 1922 in 1927 , he abandoned his first name in favour of his middle name , and thereafter chose to be known as richard sickert seen by many of his contemporaries as evidence of the artist 's decline , sickert 's late works are also his most forward-looking , and prefigure the practices of chuck close and gerhard richter the two men got along so well that churchill , whose hobby was painting , wrote to his wife that '' he is really giving me a new lease of life as a painter he became a royal academician ( ra ) in march 1934 but resigned from the academy on 9 may 1935 in protest against the president 's refusal to support the preservation of jacob epstein 's sculptural reliefs on the british medical association building in the strand he had been married three times : from 1885 until their divorce in 1899 to ellen cobden , a daughter of richard cobden ; from 1911 until her death in 1920 to christine angus ; and from 1926 until his death to the painter thérèse lessore he subsequently adopted a more deliberate procedure of painting pictures in multiple stages , and '' attached a great deal of importance to what he called the 'cooking ' side of painting '' he experimented tirelessly with the details of his method , always with the goal , according to his biographer wendy baron , of '' painting quickly , in about two sittings , with the maximum economy and minimum of fuss '' for his music hall subjects , sickert often chose complex and ambiguous points of view , so that the spatial relationship between the audience , performer and orchestra becomes confused , as figures gesture into space and others are reflected in mirrors in an article he wrote for the fortnightly review in 1911 , he described his reaction to the paintings of van gogh : '' i execrate his treatment of the instrument i love , these strips of metallic paint that catch the light like so many dyed straws 1906–1909 were painted in heavy impasto and narrow tonal range , as were numerous other obese nudes in the pre-world war i period in which the fleshiness of the figures is connected to the thickness of the paint—a device that was later adapted by lucian freud the influence of these paintings on successive generations of british artists has been noted in the works of freud , david bomberg , francis bacon , frank auerbach , howard hodgkin , and leon kossoff sickert 's late works display his preference for thinly scrubbed veils of paint , described by helen lessore as '' a cool colour rapidly brushed over a warm underpainting ( or vice versa ) on a coarse canvas and in a restricted range allowing the undercoat to 'grin through ' '' sickert insisted on the importance of subject matter in art , saying that '' all the greater draughtsmen tell a story '' , but treated his subjects in a detached manner he made obvious his frequent reliance on snapshots and press photographs , he copied , used and took over the work of other , dead , artists and made extensive use , also , of the services of his assistants who played a large and increasing part in the production of his work sickert took a keen interest in the crimes of jack the ripper and believed he had lodged in a room used by the notorious serial killer although for over 80 years there was no mention of sickert being a suspect in the ripper crimes , in the 1970s authors began to explore the idea that sickert was jack the ripper or his accomplice wendy baron , 'sickert , walter richard ( 1860–1942 ) ’ , oxford dictionary of national biography , oxford university press , september 2004 ;
