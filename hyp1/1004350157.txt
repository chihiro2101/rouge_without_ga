while the r-7 turned out to be impractical as a weapon , it became the basis for a series of soviet expendable launch system , the soyuz ( rocket family ) as of 2018 , in modified versions ( soyuz-u , soyuz-fg , and the soyuz-2 ( including the boosterless soyuz-2.1v ) , the vehicle is still in service , having launched over 1840 times ; 8k71 : the grau designation for the r-7 semyorka missile ( grau 8k : missiles 71 : model number ) ; 8k74 : the grau designation for the r-7a semyorka missile ( grau 8k : missiles 74 : model number ) ; 8k71ps : sputnik 1 launcher note : much developed variants of the r-7 are still active : soyuz-u ( 11a511u ) soyuz-fg ( 11a511u-fg ) soyuz-2.1a ( 14a14a ) soyuz-2.1b ( 14a14b ) the additional development resulted in the 8k74 ( also known as r-7a ) , which was lighter , had better navigation systems , more powerful engines , extended its range to by carrying more fuel , and increased payload to aside from the initial sputnik launches , the 8k71 formed the basis of the 8k72 booster used for the first generation luna probes a modified version of the missile ( 8k71ps ) placed sputnik 1 in orbit from baikonur on 4 october 1957 and sputnik 2 on 3 november 1957 the dummy warhead impacted in the pacific ocean and five days later , tass announced that the soviet union had '' successfully tested a multi-stage intercontinental ballistic missile '' the r-7 was long , in diameter and weighed ; it had two stages , powered by rocket engines using liquid oxygen ( lox ) and kerosene and capable of delivering its payload up to , with an accuracy ( cep ) of around starting from the r-1 , which was a copy of the german v-2 , a free-standing missile was launched from a horizontal pad the next attempt on 11 june ( the same day the united states conducted its first test launch of an icbm ) , an electrical short caused the missile to start rolling uncontrollably and disintegrate 33 seconds after liftoff ; ss-6 sapwood : nato reporting name for all versions of the r-7 , variants identified by suffix letter on the name portion ( e.g the solution was to eliminate the pad and to suspend the entire rocket in the trusses that bear both vertical weight load as well as horizontal wind forces korolev rocket and space corporation energia , a russian rocket and space contractor the r-7 missile , history of its development socio-educational portal « workers of the cosmos » design work began in 1953 at okb-1 in kaliningrad in moscow oblast ( presently korolyov , moscow oblast ) and other divisions with the requirement for a two-stage missile of with a range of and the maximum speed of 20 mach carrying a warhead
