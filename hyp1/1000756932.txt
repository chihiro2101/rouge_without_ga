was adopted as the official irish title of the irish free state when it was established at the end of the irish war of independence , although this free state was not a republic but a form of constitutional monarchy within the british empire after the irish state had changed its name to '' ireland '' , in 1949 the description of the state was declared '' republic of ireland '' , while in irish it was translated as lloyd george asked , '' what is your irish word for republic ? '' after some delay and no reply , lloyd george commented : '' must we not admit that the celts never were republicans and have no native word for such an idea ? '' lord longford gives a different account in peace by ordeal : '' the only doubt in de valera 's mind , as he explained to lloyd george , arose from the current dispute among gaelic purists whether the idea republic was better conveyed by the broader 'saorstát ' or the more abstract 'poblacht ' by this declaration they claimed to establish an independent state called the '' irish republic '' and proclaimed that the leaders of the rebellion would serve as the '' provisional government of the irish republic '' until it became possible to elect a national parliament a compromise was reached at the 1917 ard fheis ( party conference ) , where it was agreed that the party would pursue the establishment of an independent republic in the short term , until the irish people could be given the opportunity to decide on the form of government they preferred in the 1918 general election , candidates of the radical sinn féin party—including many who had participated in the 1916 rebellion—issued a manifesto which included the statement : '' sinn féin aims at securing the establishment of that republic '' on the same day as the declaration of independence was issued , two members of the royal irish constabulary ( ric ) escorting a cartload of gelignite were killed in the tipperary soloheadbeg ambush , carried out by members of the 3rd tipperary brigade of the irish volunteers , led by dan breen and seán treacy this ambush had not been ordered by the dáil , but the course of events soon drove the dáil to recognise the volunteers as the army of the irish republic , and so the soloheadbeg incident became the opening incident of the undeclared anglo-irish war between the volunteers and great britain the decision to establish a republic in 1919 , rather than any other form of government , was significant because it amounted to a complete repudiation of all constitutional ties with great britain , and set the party against any compromise that might involve initial self-government under the home rule act 1914 or continued membership of the british empire one obstacle to this decision—that the unionists of the north-east had long indicated that they would never participate in any form of a republic—was left unresolved , the six north-eastern counties remaining part of the united kingdom under the government of ireland act 1920 , and later the anglo-irish treaty two further general elections called by the lord lieutenant of ireland , under the government of ireland act 1920 , the lord lieutenant of ireland was to be the chief executive of both northern ireland and southern ireland the second dáil comprised members returned in the 1921 elections for the parliaments of northern ireland and southern ireland ; the third dáil was elected at the 1922 general election as the '' provisional parliament '' of '' southern ireland '' , as provided for by the anglo-irish treaty the military branch of the irish republic were the irish volunteers who , in the course of the war of independence , who were formally renamed the '' irish republican army '' to reflect their status as the national army of the declared republic the judicial arm of the irish republic consisted of a network of dáil courts administered by ira officers , which at first operated in parallel with the british judicial system , and gradually came to supersede it as public opinion swung against the british in some parts of the island the irish republic had some of the attributes of a functioning state ; a ministry ( with a head of state in the latter stages ) , a parliament , a courts system , a police force and a constitution the extent to which these functioned fluctuated in different parts of the island , with the success or otherwise of republican institutions depending both on the degree of control of the ira in the region and on the brutality of the black and tans and auxiliaries , active from june 1920 to july 1921 at the height of the irish war of independence , as atrocities committed by the black and tans reached such a scale as to result in the burning of the city of cork ( leading to widespread criticism in the united states and from king george v ) , the republican police and dáil courts reached their zenith , and senior barristers who had qualified within the british courts system also represented defendants in the dáil courts this was in part due to standing down the royal irish constabulary ( ric ) in early 1922 before a new police force was ready to operate ; in the interim the irish republican army ( ira ) , dividing within itself over the treaty , was the only police force of wilson 's 'fourteen points ' outlined in january 1918 did not , however , promise that all colonies would be decolonised on demand at the end of the war , but that a colonial population 's claim for arbitration would have '' equal weight '' with any claim by its government the british view was that the 69 new sinn féin members of parliament had chosen not to take their seats at westminster ( to the relief of the conservative party ) , and that an irish settlement would be arranged after the more important treaties with the former central powers had been signed off , involving sinn féin as the representatives of the majority , whether or not it had proclaimed a republic the proposal was greeted with mild enthusiasm among irish unionists in the new northern ireland , who had never sought their own home rule , but was rejected by a combination of irish republicans , irish nationalists and irish unionists who were not in northern ireland while rejecting the right of the british parliament to legislate for ireland , sinn féin took the opportunity of the two general elections in may 1921 , one in the north and one in the south , to seek a renewed mandate for the republic each side in the 1921 negotiations used sufficiently elastic language to enable the republic 's delegates to suggest that what was taking place was inter-state negotiations , while allowing the british government to suggest that it was an internal united kingdom of great britain and ireland matter it was : passed by dáil éireann , to satisfy the belief in the republic 's supporters that it was a state and its parliament was sovereign ; passed by the united kingdom , to satisfy british constitutional theory that a treaty had been negotiated between his majesty 's government and his majesty 's subjects in ireland ; passed by the house of commons of southern ireland , to reflect the belief in british constitutional law that ireland already possessed a home rule parliament finally , the two structures of government ( the british government 's administration in dublin castle and the republic 's ) began a process of convergence , to cover the year until the coming into force of the new irish free state right by approving the anglo-irish treaty on 7 january 1922 and the constitution of the irish free state in october 1922 the dáil agreed to the replacement of the republic with the system of constitutional monarchy of the irish free state on 6 december 1922 , the constitution of the irish free state came into effect and the institutions of both the irish republic and the provisional government ceased to exist the principle of an all-island republic remains a central aspiration of at least three of the politics in the republic of ireland ( fianna fáil , fine gael and sinn féin ) and of two of the politics of northern ireland ( sinn féin and the sdlp ) when the dáil ratified the treaty its opponents mostly walked out , arguing that the dáil was attempting to 'destroy ' the irish republic , and that its members had no right to do so '' opponents of the treaty refused to recognise either the provisional government or , when it was established , the irish free state , insisting that the irish republic continued to exist as a entity their line of authority included some tds but also the army executive of the ira which decided in early 1922 that it , and no longer the dáil , was the only body loyal to the republic the anti-treaty faction also refused to recognise the third dáil elected in june 1922 , as the second dáil had not met to dissolve itself formally ( though the '' declaration of election '' on 19 may , which gave dates for nominations and the election , was not opposed at the time ) the pira conducted a campaign of bombings and shootings in northern ireland from the late 1960s until 1998 , and its political wing , the modern sinn féin party , used to insist that the irish republic was still legally in existence , with the provisional ira as its national army , and the ira army council ireland 's sole legitimate government
