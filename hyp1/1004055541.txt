in order to distance the new edition from the less commercially and critically successful aspects of the west end game line , and to discourage new players from wasting time and money on what he considered to be inferior products , varney additionally used the designer 's notes to declare many west end products , including the '' fifth edition '' and everything published for the 2nd edition after the people 's glorious revolutionary adventure , to be '' unproducts '' - no longer part of the game 's continuity , and not recommended for use with the new edition in a posting on rpg.net he explained that the point of including the three playstyles in paranoia xp was to counteract the impression that '' zap '' -styled play was the default for paranoia , an impression which had in part been created by the more cartoonish later supplements in the west end games line ( as well as '' fifth edition '' ) within the game , infrared-clearance citizens live dull lives of mindless drudgery and are heavily medicated , while higher clearance characters may be allowed to demote or even summarily execute those of a lower rank and those with ultraviolet clearance are almost completely unrestricted and have a great deal of access to the computer ; they are the only citizens that may ( legally ) access and modify the computer 's programming , and thus ultraviolet citizens are also referred to as '' high programmers '' the designers in turn granted a license to mongoose publishing to produce a new version of the game , with the result that paranoia xp , written by allen varney , aaron allston , paul baldowski , beth fischi , dan curtis johnson and greg costikyan , was published in 2004 in particular , many felt the removal of the computer - and thus the power structure associated with it - and the greater freedom given to player characters effectively wrecked the very premise of the game , which required that player characters had little freedom , had to appease the demands of the computer , and were presented with insane situations that arose from the ludicrous rules of alpha complex society the paranoia rulebook is unusual in a number of ways ; demonstrating any knowledge of the rules is forbidden , and most of the rulebook is written in an easy , conversational tone that often makes fun of the players and their characters , while occasionally taking digs at other notable role-playing games in his introduction to flashbacks , a compilation of paranoia adventures from the west end games era , allen varney fully details the management decisions which led , in the eyes of many , to the decline of the paranoia line , and cites rumours that the line saw a 90 % decline in sales before west end games went into bankruptcy : art director larry catalano left west end in 1986 in june 2009 , mongoose publishing announced that they would be retiring the books in the xp line to clear the way for the 25th anniversary edition line - revealing a new edition of the rulebook as well as two new rulebooks , one casting the players as higher-clearance internal security investigators and one as ultraviolet high programmers since then , various unauthorised automated versions of the story ( a troubleshooter 's assignment to undermine the subversive activity known as christmas ) have been circulating through mainframes and pcs , with machine-independent ports to c , python , go and inform as well as to adventure game toolkit and for applix , cp/m and the cybiko the troubleshooters volume presents a slimmed-down version of the xp rules , the most notable difference being the removal of the service firms and the advanced economy of the xp edition , with the focus firmly on the game 's traditional premise of casting the player characters as red-clearance troubleshooters allen varney , designer of the xp edition , explained in a posting on rpg.net that this decision came about as a result of the xp edition successfully convincing the wider gaming public that '' zap '' was not the default playstyle for the game ; since it was now generally accepted that paranoia could have a variety of playstyles and each gm would interpret it somewhat differently , it was considered no longer necessary to emphasise the different playstyles in the main text in addition to these six published editions , it is known that west end games were working on a '' third edition '' - to replace the poorly received fifth edition - in the late 1990s , but their financial issues would prevent this edition from being published , except for being included in one tournament adventure the actual societies which would be encountered in a game depends on the play style ; some societies are more suited for more light-hearted games ( zap-style , or the lighter end of classic ) , whereas others represent a more serious threat to alpha complex and are therefore more suitable for straight or the more dark sort of classic games paranoia is a humorous role-playing game set in a dystopia similar to nineteen eighty-four , brave new world , logan 's run , and thx 1138 ; however , the tone of the game is rife with black humor , frequently tongue-in-cheek rather than dark and heavy as well as the lighter , sillier atmosphere , fans also disliked the lower production values of the new edition , in which most of the internal art consisted of extremely cartoonish and sketchy illustrations as opposed to the more detailed and thematically-appropriate jim holloway illustrations of previous editions ( the game skipped two editions as a joke , and possibly also as a reference to the two major revisions to the game released during the lifetime of the second edition with the crash course manual and the paranoia sourcebook while they undoubtedly did so , giving roleplayers the opportunity to transcend time and space , play in a post-apocalyptic computerless alpha complex , or play in a post-post-apocalyptic alpha complex in which the computer battled for control with other factions , many fans felt these new settings ran counter to the spirit of the game three of these were published by west end games - the 1st , 2nd , and '' fifth '' editions - whereas the later three editions ( paranoia xp , the 25th anniversary edition and the '' red clearance '' edition ) were published by mongoose publishing primary designer allen varney , in the designer 's notes , explained that his aim with the new edition was to return to the game 's roots whilst updating both the game system and the satirical setting to take account of twenty years of game design progress the full order of clearances from lowest to highest is infrared ( visually represented by black ) , red , orange , yellow , green , blue , indigo , violet , and ultraviolet ( visually represented by white ) ( think roy g biv , but with ultraviolet and infrared ) in september 2004 , both attracted some mainstream attention when the uk edition of pc gamer magazine ran an article about paranoia as one of their '' extra life '' columns and showcased jparanoia and paranoia live ; coincidentally the publicity came right before the site was poised to celebrate the launch of the new paranoia edition from mongoose in an interview in 1999 scott palter of west end expressed hopes that the third edition would be published that summer ; however , he also disclosed that court proceedings had been begun by the original designers in order to reclaim the rights to the game the computer serves as the game 's principal antagonist , and fears a number of threats to its 'perfect ' society , such as the outdoors , mutants , and secret society ( especially communism ) the third game , paranoia : high programmers , casts the player characters as the ultraviolet-clearance elite of alpha complex society and focuses on the political plotting and infighting that dominates the high programmers ' lives , a premise not dissimilar to the violet-level campaign ideas presented in extreme paranoia this edition , while encouraging dark humour in-game , took a fairly serious dystopian tone ; the supplements and adventures released to accompany it emphasised the lighter side , however , establishing the freewheeling mix of slapstick , intra-team backstabbing and satire that is classically associated with a game of paranoia additional writing for the new edition was initially provided by gareth hanrahan , while the first major expansion , acute paranoia , was written by various writers and funded through kickstarter in 2018 for an early 2019 release notable amongst the supplements was extreme paranoia , which provided ideas for scenarios based around characters of security clearances orange to violet , with premises differing greatly from the standard red-clearance troubleshooter concept but remaining thematically appropriate to the game 's setting and atmosphere 150px following the bankruptcy of west end games , the original designers of paranoia banded together and purchased the rights to the game from west end in order to regain control of the line an upshot of this is that much of the poorly received metaplot established late in the west end games line , from the secret society wars to the reboot and beyond , was disposed of most of the game 's humor is derived from the players ' ( usually futile ) attempts to complete their assignment while simultaneously adhering to the computer 's arbitrary , contradictory and often nonsensical security directives the internal security volume casts the player characters as blue-clearance internal security agents , a refinement of the premise of the 1st edition supplement hil sector blues ( reprinted in the xp line as part of extreme paranoia ) 150px 2nd edition - written by greg costikyan , dan gelber , eric goldberg , ken rolston , and paul murphy - published in 1987 by west end games 150px 1st edition - written by greg costikyan , dan gelber , and eric goldberg - published in 1984 by west end games in both the core rulebook and the flashbacks supplement - a reprint of classic adventures originally published by west end games - varney was highly critical of west end games ' handling of the product line in its latter days later , some of the best players and writers from the game and a few other places were formally integrated as the traitor recycling studio to write official paranoia material ; their first credited work was the mission supplement crash priority
