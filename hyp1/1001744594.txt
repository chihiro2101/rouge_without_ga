however , the kâ€“pg extinction event created a window of time with large predators absent that may have allowed the ancestors of ratites to evolve flightlessness an increase in leg size compensates for a reduction in wing length in insular birds that have not lost flight by providing a longer lever to increase force generated during the thrust that initiates takeoff they have no separation of pterylae ( feathered areas ) and apteria ( non-feathered areas ) , for definitions of the two latin words and finally , they have palaeognathous palates some extinct ratites might have had odder lifestyles , such as the narrow-billed diogenornis and palaeotis , compared to the shorebird-like lithornithids , and could imply similar animalivorous diets ratite chicks tend to be more omnivorous or insectivorous ; similarities in adults end with feeding , as they all vary in diet and length of digestive tract , which is indicative of diet one hypothesis suggests that as predation pressure decreases on islands with low raptor species richness and no mammalian predators , the need for large , powerful flight muscles that make for a quick escape decreases moas and elephant birds were the largest native herbivores in their faunas , far larger than contemporary herbivorous mammals in the latter 's case ratites are different from the flying birds in that they needed to adapt or evolve certain features to protect their young ratites in general have many physical characteristics in common , which are often not shared by the family tinamidae , or tinamous ratites and humans have had a long relationship starting with the use of the egg for water containers , jewelry , or other art medium the usda 's food safety and inspection service ( fsis ) began a voluntary , fee-for-service ratite inspection program in 1995 to help the fledgling industry improve the marketability of the meat but energetic efficiency can only help explain the loss of flight when the benefits of flying are not critical to survival
