the concept of '' majestic 12 '' emerged during a period in the 1980s when ufologists believed there had been a cover-up of the roswell ufo incident and speculated some secretive upper tier of the united states government was responsible their suppositions appeared to be confirmed in 1984 when ufologist jaime shandera received an envelope containing film which , when developed , showed images of eight pages of documents that appeared to be briefing papers describing '' operation majestic 12 '' the documents purported to reveal a secret committee of 12 , supposedly authorized by united states president harry s truman in 1952 , and explain how the crash of an alien spacecraft at roswell in july of 1947 had been concealed , how the recovered alien technology could be exploited , and how the united states should engage with extraterrestrial life in the future claiming to be connected to the united states air force office of special investigations , a man named richard doty told filmmaker linda moulton howe that the mj-12 story was true , and showed howe unspecified documents purporting to prove the existence of small , grey humanoid aliens originating from the zeta reticuli star system soon , distrust and suspicion led to disagreements within the ufology community over the authenticity of the mj-12 documents , and moore was accused of taking part in an elaborate hoax , while other ufologists and debunkers such as philip j klass 's investigation of the mj-12 documents found that robert cutler was actually out of the country on the date he supposedly wrote the '' cutler/twining memo '' , and that the truman signature was '' a pasted-on photocopy of a genuine signature — including accidental scratch marks — from a memo that truman wrote to vannevar bush on october 1 , 1947 '' other discrepancies noted by klass included the use of a distinctive date format that matched one used in moore 's personal letters , and a conversation reported by brad sparks in which moore confided that he was contemplating creating and releasing some hoax top secret documents in hopes that such bogus documents would encourage former military and intelligence officials who knew about the government 's ( alleged ) ufo coverup to break their oaths of secrecy he cited ufologist bill moore ’ s suspicion that , rather than a hoax perpetrated by the ufo community , the papers were actually part of a disinformation campaign of the us government meant to deflect attention from secret air force projects
