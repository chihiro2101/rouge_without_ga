unambiguous moss fossils have been recovered from as early as the permian of antarctica and russia , and a case is put forwards for carboniferous mosses the weathered rocks also released a lot of phosphorus and iron which ended up in the oceans , where it caused massive algal blooms , resulting in organic carbon burial , extracting more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere small organisms feeding on the nutrients created large areas without oxygen , which caused a mass extinction of marine species , while the levels of co 2 dropped all over the world , allowing the formation of ice caps on the poles file : mossopolis.jpg dense moss colonies in a cool coastal forest file : mossforest.jpg a cool high altitude/latitude moss forest ; the forest floor is covered in moss , beneath conifers file : route 1 , between vik and kirkjubæjarklaustur - panoramio ( 7 ) file : steinerne rinne bei obererasbach im altmühltal.jpg moss growing along the stream from a karst spring ; travetine deposits from the stream water and the moss overgrows it , forming this ridge , with the stream on top file : winter moss.jpg moss with sporophytes on brick file : mech plonnik mlode sporofity.jpg young sporophytes of the common moss tortula muralis ( wall screw-moss ) file : taiwan 2009 jinguashi historic gold mine moss covered retaining wall frd 8940.jpg retaining wall covered in moss file : michiganmosspatch.jpg a small clump of moss beneath a conifer ( a shady , usually dry place ) file : mossonconcretewall.jpg moss on a concrete wall since moss gametophytes are autotrophic they require enough sunlight to perform photosynthesis in most areas , mosses grow chiefly in moist , shaded areas , such as wooded areas and at the edges of streams , but they can grow anywhere in cool , humid , cloudy climates , and some species are adapted to sunny , seasonally dry areas like alpine rocks or stabilized sand dunes moss species can be classed as growing on : rocks , exposed mineral soil , disturbed soils , acid soil , calcareous soil , cliff seeps and waterfall spray areas , streamsides , shaded humusy soil , downed logs , burnt stumps , tree trunk bases , upper tree trunks , and tree branches or in bogs examples would be rhytidiadelphus squarrosus , a garden weed in vancouver and seattle areas ; bryum argenteum , the cosmopolitan sidewalk moss , and ceratodon purpureus , red roof moss , another cosmopolitan species a few species are wholly aquatic , such as fontinalis antipyretica , common water moss ; and others such as sphagnum inhabit bogs , marshes and very slow-moving waterways it is generally believed that in the northern hemisphere , the north side of trees and rocks will generally have more luxuriant moss growth on average than other sides moss releases the fixed nitrogen , along with other nutrients , into the soil '' upon disturbances like drying-rewetting and fire events , '' making it available throughout the ecosystem however , specific species of moss can be extremely difficult to maintain away from their natural sites with their unique requirements of combinations of light , humidity , substrate chemistry , shelter from wind , etc moss spores fall in a constant rain on exposed surfaces ; those surfaces which are hospitable to a certain species of moss will typically be colonised by that moss within a few years of exposure to wind and rain surfaces can also be prepared with acidic substances , including buttermilk , yogurt , urine , and gently puréed mixtures of moss samples , water and ericaceous compost in the cool , humid , cloudy pacific northwest , moss is sometimes allowed to grow naturally as a moss lawn , one that needs little or no mowing , fertilizing or watering the mossery is typically constructed out of slatted wood , with a flat roof , open to the north side ( maintaining shade ) in containerized nursery operations , coarse mineral materials such as sand , gravel , and rock chips are used as a fast-draining top dressing in plant containers to discourage moss growth traditionally , dried moss was used in some nordic countries and russia as an insulator between logs in log cabins , and tribes of the northeastern united states and southeastern canada used moss to fill chinks in wooden longhouses decaying moss in the genus sphagnum is also the major component of peat , which is '' mined '' for use as a fuel , as a horticulture soil additive , and in smoking malt in the production of scotch whisky the plant underworld , sphagnum and water , australian botanic garden in world war i , sphagnum mosses were used as first-aid dressings on soldiers ' wounds , as these mosses said to absorb liquids three times faster than cotton , retain liquids better , better distribute liquids uniformly throughout themselves , and are cooler , softer , and be less irritating in rural uk , fontinalis antipyretica was traditionally used to extinguish fires as it could be found in substantial quantities in slow-moving rivers and the moss retained large volumes of water which helped extinguish the flames prominent examples are the identification of moss genes with implications for crop improvement or human health ralf reski and wolfgang frank ( 2005 ) : moss ( physcomitrella patens ) functional genomics – gene discovery and tool development with implications for crop plants and human health
