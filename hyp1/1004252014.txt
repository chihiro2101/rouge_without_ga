first the demand for fish consumption is very low in the coastal towns due to limited population densities , and as result of this , a very small number of artisan fishermen are engaged in subsistence type of fishing and use small boats just to feed their families and meet the available market third , large scale of fishing is hampered by absence of constant ice-making and fish storage facilities ; lack of organization and skills in repairing and maintenance services of fishing boats and fishing gear ; high fuel costs ; and above all lack of freezer trucks to transport fish to major urban centers where demand for fish is very high however , since the 1970s , almost all valleys and banks of the dry rivers with running streams were turned into irrigated farms and , in the process , the thick forests were cleared , burned for charcoal and/or used for construction purposes and , consequently , the wild animals hunted , killed or migrated as their habitats completely were devastated by human intrusion besides , zeila is the entry point of people and goods coming from republic djibouti and , as a result of this , there is a customs office where the ministry of finance collects import taxes from goods entering the country moreover , the socialist regime of siyad barre has introduced cooperative farming practices , and , as a result , many common grazing lands and valleys and that were the breeding environment of wildlife , were given to specific people in the name of farming cooperatives despite the sector plays an important role in the economy of the region , it is constrained by , first , absence of financial institutions for financing existing and potential business opportunities there had been a total of 64 of public offices and houses in the region ( 40 in borama , 12 in baki and 12 in lughaya ) with the exception of a few fishers in the coastal towns , most of the people in lughaya and zeila districts are pastoralists that rear camels , sheep and goats in the coastal plains there had been thick forests in the valleys and along banks of the river beds that had been a conducive environment for various wild animals such as lions , kudu , oryx , leopards , cheetah , mountain dik-dik ( ala-kud ) , gazelles and even elephants the two districts of lughaya and zeila are coastal towns in the region and are respectively the capital cities of the two districts in 2011 , a severe long drought had hit the coastal districts lughaya , zeila districts for the last three years and affected the livelihood of pastoralists in these areas even the land surrounding the post office , including its front compound are taken and built by intruders currently , the total employees of the sector in the region are 7 the mandate of the ministry of justice is ensuring that the fundamental rights and freedoms of somalilanders , and , as result , have established an effective legal mechanism that protects the citizens against oppression and abuses as indicated in ndp of somaliland government , there is an urgent need for formulation of sound national environment protection policy and establishment of an effective environmental management mechanism in order to achieve a sustainable national and subnational development '' un ( 1999 ) somaliland : update to sml26165.e of 14 february 1997 on the situation in zeila , including who is controlling it , whether there is fighting in the area , and whether refugees are returning besides , the distance between zeila and borama is about 250 & nbsp ; km and it takes about 8 hours for a truck to travel between the two towns due to the poor condition of the road finally , the sector is constrained by the absence of institutional capacity including ice-making and fish storage facilities in coastal towns the head office of the sector in the region has neither the capacity nor the resources required for the restoration of sector operations according to a regional water officer , the bore wells el-gal , and laanta morohda are in zeila district ; and karure and kalowle are in lughaya district the fishing communities in coastal towns of zeila and lughaya are separated from major towns in the region by sandy coastal plains which stretch more than 60 70 & nbsp ; km from the sea and more than 120 & nbsp ; km from east to west the coastal zone is brutally hot , sometimes more than 45-degree celsius , during the summer , from may to september , and receives lesser rain than other zones in the region in the same year , 45 families of the agro-pastoralist community in west of borama town lost 123 of their cattle which represented 41 % of the total cattle population of the community the purpose the airport was built was to enable the region to have an access to air transport for the movement of goods and people and link the region to the outside world most of the people in this zone are sedentary agro-pastoralists that mix cultivation of cereals crops in rain-fed farms with livestock keeping in small cattle numbers such as cattle , sheep , and goats roland marchal ( 1997 ) states that numerically , the gadabuursi are the predominant inhabitants of the awdal region : '' the gadabuursi 's numerical predominance in awdal virtually ensures that gadabuursi interests drive the politics of the region it is primarily inhabited by the three sub-clans of the gadabursi clan , whose traditional institutions survived the colonial period , somali statehood and the war in good shape , remaining functionally intact and highly relevant to public security there are only 10 staff people in the region including a security guard at the present , and they share two available offices as a result of this , the only reliable water sources in the coastal zones are strategically placed bore wells both for human and livestock consumption borama is grade '' a '' district and is one of the six districts under the provision of joint program for local governance ( jplg ) program besides , availability of fishing gear , spare parts and lack of fishing gear repairs and maintenance skills are major bottlenecks of the fishing industry in the region accordingly , the provision of sufficient and drinkable water supply is very crucial for lives of town people and for the movement of people between somaliland and republic of djibouti he also wrote about the rich vegetation and the presence of wild animals such as elephants , antelopes , lions , leopards , black panthers , and different types of birds it is said that the last elephant in somaliland has died in the 1940s in dibirawein valley , now in baki district , and some of its bones are still sitting there behind sandy coastal plains in the south , transportation in the mountainous zone , with deep gorges , valleys and dry river beds cutting deep in the zone , is very difficult and risky eventually , the borama power station collapsed for mismanagement and distribution infrastructures such as overhead wires and poles are now being used by private electricity companies created right after the collapse of the power station borama is the regional capital of the region and has the largest population in the region '' marleen renders and ulf terlinden ( 2010 ) both state that the gadabuursi almost exclusively inhabit the awdal region : '' awdal in western somaliland is situated between djibouti , ethiopia and the issaq-populated mainland of somaliland manufacturing industries is very limited and mostly depend on imported raw materials according to their capital base , enterprises in the region can roughly be divided into three main categories or levels : low , medium , and upper stones such as emerald , sapphire , and aquamarine are mined in the mountainous part ( golis range ) of the region there had been three such sites in borama , jir-jir , libaaxley , and baki which were reserved for wildlife and livestock grazing fourth , both zeila and lughaya occur on straight coastline without natural shelter , absence of fishing ports ( jetty ) and landing sites together , the sandy coastal plains and mountainous features make market accessibility almost impossible of transporting fish from coastal towns to major urban centers since most of somaliland 's major urban centers are in ogo zone which occurs south of both of coastal and mountainous zones understanding the fragility of the somaliland environment , the colonial administrations introduced parks , reserved grazing lands , and established forestry camps in the region lack of institutional capacities such shortage of trained staff , budgetary restrictions and lack of transport are some of the constraints hampering borama airport operations the mandate of the ministry includes : â€¢ collection and analysis of data and other relevant information in collaboration with the regional offices and other sectors they are a few in numbers and are involved in either service sector such as remittance , merchandising , import-export trading , or run small scale manufacturing industries however , the bore wells have no back ups and if a bore well breaks down , the live of both livestock and the people are at great risk like other regions , charcoal and fire woods are the main fuel sources utilized for household , businesses and other institutions that are involved in food services in the region awdal is primarily inhabited by people from the somali ethnic group , with the gadabuursi subclan of the dir especially well represented and considered the predominant clan of the region a colonial governor from zeila travelled along the coastal zone in 1887and described the rich vegetations and heavy forests along the banks of dry rivers in the coastal plains , some of which with running streams somaliland government carried out all necessary steps of ensuring that an effective and transparent justice system is in place and the rule of law is duly applied with all the necessary court proceedings and investigation processes of civil and criminal cases p.64 because of the topographical features of the region , road transport is an impediment to development of the region the building is very old and made of mud bricks and is one of the few public offices not occupied by squatters there is one privately owned tv station ( rayo tv ) in borama , and is viewed on normal antenna in borama township the regional ministry of ministry of planning ( somaliland ) panning and development 55 '' ministry of national planning and development , somaliland ''
