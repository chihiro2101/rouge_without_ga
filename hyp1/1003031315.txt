in the afternoon of 23 february 1848 the king summoned his minister from the chamber , which was then sitting , and informed him that considering the situation in paris and elsewhere in the country during the banquet agitation for electoral reform , and the alarm and division of opinion in the royal family , led him to doubt whether he could retain guizot as his prime minister in 1831 casimir périer formed a more vigorous and compact administration , terminated in may 1832 by his death ; the summer of that year was marked by a formidable republican rising in paris , and it was not until 11 october 1832 that a stable government was formed , in which marshal soult was first minister , victor , 3rd duc de broglie took the foreign office , adolphe thiers the home department , and guizot the department of public instruction his confidence in himself , and in the majority of the chamber which he had moulded to his will , was unbounded ; and long success and the habit of authority led him to forget that in a country like france there was a people outside the chamber elected by a small constituency , to which the minister and the king himself were held responsible as he himself remarked , he was a stranger to england and a novice in diplomacy ; the embroiled state of the syrian war question , on which the french government had separated itself from the joint policy of europe , and possibly the absence of entire confidence between the ambassador and the minister of foreign affairs , placed him in an embarrassing and even false position madeleine bingham , princess lieven – russian intriguer , hamish hamilton 1982 , p.209 et seq , pen portrait p.211 during the first french empire , guizot , entirely devoted to literary pursuits , published a collection of french synonyms ( 1809 ) , an essay on the fine arts ( 1811 ) , and a translation of edward gibbon 's the history of the decline and fall of the roman empire , with additional notes , in 1812 absent from paris at the moment of the fall of napoleon in 1814 , he was at once selected , on the recommendation of royer-collard , to serve the government of king louis xviii , in the capacity of secretary-general of the ministry of the interior , under the abbé de montesquiou he respected in the church of rome the faith of the majority of his countrymen , and the writings of the great catholic prelates , bossuet and bourdaloue , were as familiar and as dear to him as those of his own persuasion , and were commonly used by him in the daily exercises of family worship , 1873 ) mme de witt , guizot dans sa famille ( 1880 ) jules simon , thiers , guizot et rémusat ( 1885 ) ;

– advice which was ill-received by the king 's confidential advisers his historical works such as histoire générale de la civilisation en europe ( 1828 ) and histoire de la civilisation en france ( 1830 ) were widely admired by such luminaries as john stuart mill ( '' i have dinned into people 's ears that guizot is a great thinker and writer '' ) , johann wolfgang von goethe ( '' guizot is a man after my own heart.he possesses deep knowledge , combined with an enlightened liberality '' ) , charles sainte-beuve ( '' this astonishing man about whom one could say so many things '' ) , and alexis de tocqueville from 1822 to 1830 he published two important collections of historical sources , the memoirs of the history of england in 26 volumes , and the memoirs of the history of france in 31 volumes , a revised translation , of shakespeare , and a volume of essays on the history of france for some weeks europe seemed to be on the brink of war , until the king ended the crisis by refusing his assent to the military preparations of thiers , and by summoning guizot from london to form a ministry and to aid his majesty in what he termed '' ma lutte tenace contre l'anarchie during these years guizot was one of the leaders of the doctrinaires , a small party strongly attached to the charter and the crown , and advocating a policy which has become associated ( especially by émile faguet ) with the name of guizot , that of the juste milieu , a middle path between absolutism and popular government he utterly failed to perceive that a more enlarged view of the liberal destinies of france and a less intense confidence in his own specific theory might have preserved the constitutional monarchy and averted a vast series of calamities , which were in the end fatal to every principle he most cherished in 1820 , when the reaction was at its height after the murder of the duc de berry , and the fall of the ministry of the duc decazes , guizot was deprived of his offices , and in 1822 even his course of lectures were interdicted nothing would have been easier than to strengthen the moderate liberal party by attaching the suffrage to the possession of land in france , but blank resistance was the sole answer of the government to the moderate demands of the opposition personally , guizot was always of opinion that it was a great misfortune for the cause of parliamentary government in france that the infatuation and ineptitude of charles x and prince polignac rendered a change in the hereditary line of succession inevitable by their influence she was urged into a marriage with a despicable offset of the house of bourbon , and her sister was at the same time married to the youngest son of the french king , in direct violation of louis philippe 's promises in this he entirely succeeded by his courage and eloquence as a parliamentary leader , and by the use of all those means of influence which france supplied to a dominant minister , 1830 ) , in january 1830 he was elected by the town of lisieux to the chamber of deputies , and he retained that seat during the whole of his political life he had now joined the ranks of the moderate liberals , and for the next eighteen years was a determined foe of democracy , the unyielding champion of '' a monarchy limited by a limited number of bourgeois the language of lord palmerston and the conduct of sir henry bulwer ( afterwards lord dalling ) at madrid led guizot to believe that this understanding was broken , provoking the affair of the spanish marriages after guizot came to believe that britain intended to place a coburg on the throne of spain he omitted the customary compliment to the all-powerful emperor , in spite of the hints given him by his patron , but the course which followed marks the beginning of the great revival of historical research in france in the 19th century but though he adhered inflexibly to the church of his fathers and combated the rationalist tendencies of the age , which seemed to threaten it with destruction , he retained not a tinge of the intolerance or asperity of the calvinism creed his voice had the greatest weight in the choice of new candidates ; the younger generation of french writers never looked in vain to him for encouragement , and his constant aim was to maintain the dignity and purity of the profession of letters she died in 1833 , leaving two daughters , henriette ( 1829–1908 ) , a co-author with her father and prolific writer herself , and pauline ( 1831–1874 ) and a son , guillaume ( 1833–1892 ) , who attained some reputation as a scholar and writer guizot was called upon by his friends casimir perier , jacques laffitte , villemain and dupin to draw up the protest of the liberal deputies against the royal ordinances of july , while he applied himself with them to control the revolutionary character of the late contest this transaction , although it was hailed at the time as a triumph of the policy of france , was in truth as fatal to the monarch as it was discreditable to the minister of finance he knew nothing ; trade and commerce were strange to him ; military and naval affairs were unfamiliar to him ; all these subjects he dealt with by second hand through his friends , pierre sylvain dumon ( 1797–1870 ) , tanneguy duchâtel ( 1803–1867 ) , or marshal bugeaud molé failed in the attempt to form a government , and between midnight and one in the morning guizot , who had according to his custom retired early to rest , was again sent for to the tuileries some of the old members of this learned body & nbsp ; – talleyrand , sieyès , roederer and lakanal & nbsp ; – again took their seats there , and a host of more recent celebrities were added by election for the free discussion of the great problems of political and social science strange to say , guizot never acknowledged either at the time or to his dying day the nature of this error , and he speaks of himself in his memoirs as the much-enduring champion of liberal government and constitutional law he replied in terms of unmeasured contempt : '' you may raise the pile of calumny as high as you will ; vous n'arriverez jamais a la hauteur de mon dédain !
