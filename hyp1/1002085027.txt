in his history of the peloponnesian war , thucydides ascribes a speech to archidamus ii in which he stresses the importance for sparta of civic education for the spartan virtues of toughness , obedience , cunning , simplicity , and preparedness : and we are wise , because we are educated with too little learning to despise the laws , and with too severe a self-control to disobey them , and are brought up not to be too knowing in useless matters—such as the knowledge which can give a specious criticism of an enemy 's plans in theory , but fails to assail them with equal success in practice—but are taught to consider that the schemes of our enemies are not dissimilar to our own , and that the freaks of chance are not determinable by calculation it is a thing worthy of very great consideration , that in that excellent , and , in truth , for its perfection , prodigious form of civil regimen set down by lycurgus , though so solicitous of the education of children , as a thing of the greatest concern , and even in the very seat of the muses , he should make so little mention of learning ; as if that generous youth , disdaining all other subjection but that of virtue , ought to be supplied , instead of tutors to read to them arts and sciences , with such masters as should only instruct them in valour , prudence , and justice ; an example that plato has followed in his laws aurelius was also taught by his father how to live as a public figure restrained by modesty : that i lived under the government of my lord and father , who would take away from me all pride and vainglory , and reduce me to that conceit and opinion that it was not impossible for a prince to live in the court without a troop of guards and followers , extraordinary apparel , such and such torches and statues , and other like particulars of state and magnificence ; but that a man may reduce and contract himself almost to the state of a private man , and yet for all that not to become the more base and remiss in those public matters and affairs , wherein power and authority is requisite in the euripides tragedy the suppliants , adrastus of argos describes how hippomedon received his civic education for endurance , martial skill , and service to the state : such another was hippomedon , third of all this band ; from his very boyhood he refrained from turning towards the allurements of the muses , to lead life of ease ; his home was in the fields , and gladly would he school his nature to hardships with a view to manliness , aye hasting to the chase , rejoicing in his steeds or straining of his bow , because he would make himself of use unto his state parallel lives , lycurgus.the iren , or under-master , used to stay a little with them after supper , and one of them he bade to sing a song , to another he put a question which required an advised and deliberate answer ; for example , who was the best man in the city ? what he thought of such an action of such a man ? they used them thus early to pass a right judgment upon persons and things , and to inform themselves of the abilities or defects of their countrymen '' essentially , the spartan ideal of civic education was a process whereby the interest of the citizen becomes totally united with the interest of the polity , in a spirit of perfect patriotism : 'to conclude , lycurgus bred up his citizens in such a way that they neither would nor could live by themselves ; they were to make themselves one with the public good , and , clustering like bees around their commander , be by their zeal and public spirit carried all but out of themselves , and devoted wholly to their country that other leading city of greece , lacedaemon , considering that lycurgus their lawgiver was so addicted to elegant learning , as to have been the first that brought out of ionia the scattered works of homer , and sent the poet thales from crete to prepare and mollify the spartan surliness with his smooth songs and odes , the better to plant among them law and civility , it is to be wondered how museless and unbookish they were , minding nought but the feats of war.project gutenberg '' the truth is , he took in their case , also , all the care that was possible ; he ordered the maidens to exercise themselves with wrestling , running , throwing the quoit , and casting the dart , to the end that the fruit they conceived might , in strong and healthy bodies , take firmer root and find better growth , and withal that they , with this greater vigor , might be the more able to undergo the pains of child bearing he also followed the example of his adopted father antoninus pius , who he said kept careful watch of government administration and finances , was open to hearing ideas about how to serve the common good , and cared neither neither for ambition nor pandering to the popular will : again , that secrets he neither had many , nor often , and such only as concerned public matters : his discretion and moderation , in exhibiting of the public sights and shows for the pleasure and pastime of the people : in public buildings neither hath learning an influence and operation only upon civil merit and moral virtue , and the arts or temperature of peace and peaceable government ; but likewise it hath no less power and efficacy in enablement towards martial and military virtue and prowess , as may be notably represented in the examples of alexander the great and cæsar the dictator ( mentioned before , but now in fit place to be resumed ) , of whose virtues and acts in war there needs no note or recital , having been the wonders of time in that kind ; but of their affections towards learning and perfections in learning it is pertinent to say somewhat and by reading of these greek , and latine authors , men from their childhood have gotten a habit ( under a false shew of liberty , ) of favouring tumults , and of licentious controlling the actions of their soveraigns ; and again of controlling those controllers , with the effusion of so much blood ; as i think i may truly say , there was never any thing so deerly bought , as these western parts have bought the learning of the greek and latine tongues for as he that is so bitten , has a continuall torment of thirst , and yet abhorreth water ; and is in such an estate , as if the poyson endeavoured to convert him into a dogge : so when a monarchy is once bitten to the quick , by those democraticall writers , that continually snarle at that estate ; it wanteth nothing more than a strong monarch , which neverthelesse out of a certain tyrannophobia , or feare of being strongly governed , when they have him , they abhorre plutarch relates a comparison made by simonides between spartan education of citizens and horse husbandry : simonides called sparta '' the tamer of men , '' because by early strictness of education , they , more than any nation , trained the citizens to obedience to the laws , and made them tractable and patient of subjection , as horses that are broken in while colts whence it was that , men say , simonides called sparta '' the tamer of men , '' because by early strictness of education , they , more than any nation , trained the citizens to obedience to the laws , and made them tractable and patient of subjection , as horses that are broken in while colts '' here he had the first sight of homer 's works , in the hands , we may suppose , of the posterity of creophylus ; and , having observed that the few loose expressions and actions of ill example which are to be found in his poems were much outweighed by serious lessons of state and rules of morality , he set himself eagerly to transcribe and digest them into order , as thinking they would be of good use in his own country for lycurgus , who ordered , as we saw , that a great piece of money should be but of an inconsiderable value , on the contrary would allow no discourse to be current which did not contain in few words a great deal of useful and curious sense ; children in sparta , by a habit of long silence , came to give just and sententious answers ; for , indeed , as loose and incontinent livers are seldom fathers of many children , so loose and incontinent talkers seldom originate many sensible words but agesilaus , whose good fortune it was to be born a younger brother , was consequently bred to all the arts of obedience , and so the better fitted for the government , when it fell to his share ; hence it was that he proved the most popular-tempered of the spartan kings , his early life having added to his natural kingly and commanding qualities the gentle and humane feelings of a citizen.translated by john dryden if they had not an answer ready to the question who was a good or who an ill-reputed citizen , they were looked upon as of a dull and careless disposition , and to have little or no sense of virtue and honor ; besides this , they were to give a good reason for what they said , and in as few words and as comprehensive as might be ; he that failed of this , or answered not to the purpose , had his thumb bit by his master and their very songs had a life and spirit in them that inflamed and possessed men 's minds with an enthusiasm and ardor for action ; the style of them was plain and without affectation ; the subject always serious and moral ; most usually , it was in praise of such men as had died in defense of their country , or in derision of those that had been cowards ; the former they declared happy and glorified ; the life of the latter they described as most miserable and abject in summe , i can not imagine , how anything can be more prejudiciall to a monarchy , than the allowing of such books to be publikely read , without present applying such correctives of discreet masters , as are fit to take away their venime ; which venime i will not doubt to compare to the biting of a mad dogge , which is a disease the physicians call hydrophobia , or fear of water the very songs which he composed were exhortations to obedience and concord , and the very measure and cadence of the verse , conveying impressions of order and tranquility , had so great an influence on the minds of the listeners , that they were insensibly softened and civilized , insomuch that they renounced their private feuds and animosities , and were reunited in a common admiration of virtue there , when he grew to man 's estate , first , as is the duty of strangers settled in another land , he showed no pique or jealousy against the state , became no quibbler , chiefest source of annoyance citizen or stranger can give , but took his stand amid the host , and fought for argos as he were her own son , glad at heart whenso the city prospered , deeply grieved if e'er reverses came ; many a lover though he had midst men and maids , yet was he careful to avoid offence the old men , too , had an eye upon them , coming often to the grounds to hear and see them contend either in wit or strength with one another , and this as seriously and with as much concern as if they were their fathers , their tutors , or their magistrates ; so that there scarcely was any time or place without someone present to put them in mind of their duty , and punish them if they had neglected it '' amongst the persons there the most renowned for their learning all their wisdom in state matters was one thales , whom lycurgus , by importunities and assurances of friendship , persuaded to go over to lacedaemon ; where , though by his outward appearance and his own profession he seemed to be no other than a lyric poet , in reality he performed the part of one of the ablest lawgivers in the world
