despite the success of his two ballets , delibes was still anxious to write a serious vocal work , and composed a grand scena , la mort d'orphée ( the death of orpheus ) , given at the trocadéro concerts in 1878 during the exposition universelle his biographer hugh macdonald writes that although delibes remained a church organist until 1871 ( he held several posts , the last of them at the church of saint jean-saint françois from 1862 ) , he was '' clearly drawn more to the theatre and found his métier at hervé 's highly successful folies-nouvelles '' in macdonald 's view , delibes ' early compositions are clearly influenced by and in the tradition of boieldieu , hérold and adam , delibes ' composition teacher at the conservatoire , from whom he had the example of '' a sparkling operetta style '' after sylvia , delibes 's only composition for dance was a suite of six dances for the comédie-française production of le roi s'amuse , the dances , in a pastiche of antique style , show a keen ear for the nuances of period character in goodwin 's view the more serious jean de nivelle , one of the works showing the influence of meyerbeer and lalo , is generally weightier in tone , with some lapses into the composer 's lighter style in such pieces as the act iii couplets , '' moi ! j'aime le bruit de bataille '' 7 ; and '' le roi l ' a dit '' , opera news , june 2016 delibes returned to the opéra in 1876 , with a grand mythological ballet , sylvia , which in jullien 's view confirmed delibes ' superiority in dance music in addition to composing , delibes earned a living as a critic ( briefly in 1858 ) ; inspector of school music ; and accompanist and later chorus master at the opéra ( from 1862 or 1863 ) 9 as a boy , delibes had an unusually fine singing voice ; he was a chorister at the church of la madeleine and sang in the première of meyerbeer 's le prophète at the paris opéra in 1849 at the latter he took part in the preparation of most of the operas in the theatre 's repertoire , including classics such as the marriage of figaro and fidelio and new works such as louis clapisson 's la fanchonnette , victor massé 's la reine topaze and gounod 's faust many were written for the bouffes-parisiens , the theatre run by jacques offenbach , including deux vieilles gardes ( '' two old guards '' ) , delibes 's second opera , which enjoyed enormous success , attributable in macdonald 's view to the composer 's gift for '' witty melody and lightness of touch '' 1 ( in french ) he studied first with antoine-jules tariot ( music theory ) , and then with félix le couppey ( piano ) , françois benoist ( organ ) , françois bazin ( harmony ) and , at eighteen , adolphe adam ( composition ) '' in van vechten 's view , delibes revolutionised ballet music by introducing in his scores '' a symphonic element , a wealth of graceful melody , and a richness of harmonic fibre , based , it is safe to hazard , on a healthy distaste for routine '' in 1882 delibes composed incidental music for a revival of victor hugo 's play le roi s'amuse at the comédie-française , consisting of a suite of pastiche medieval dances for orchestra ( '' six airs de danse dans le style ancien '' ) and a song with mandolin accompaniment ( '' quand bourbon vit marseille '' ) 7 macdonald writes : lakmé was quickly taken up by opera houses across europe , and productions followed in london ( 1885 ) and new york ( 1886 ) ; reviews of the american production were highly enthusiastic ; those of the british production were less so , but in both cities it prospered at the box-office coppélius in stiff , dry counterpoint , the canonic device ingeniously applied also to coppélia , the doll he has created ; franz in two themes , each sharing the same melodic shape of the first four notes , but the second having a more sentimental feeling than the sprightly first theme '' lakmé – which grove dictionary of music and musicians ranks as delibes ' masterpiece , even above coppelia and sylvia – shows the influence of bizet , with echoes of carmen and les pêcheurs de perles in the harmonic techniques and subtleties of orchestration tchaikovsky was greatly impressed by it , calling sylvia : carl van vechten shared tchaikovsky 's view that delibes revolutionised ballet composition : '' before he began to compose his ballets , music for dancing , for the most part , consisted of tinkle-tinkle melodies with marked rhythm later , consciously seeking to move from light popular works into a more elevated genre , his works show the influence of meyerbeer and gounod , as well as the slightly younger bizet and lalo some of the songs evoke the period style of the 16th century , such as '' avril '' , '' chanson de l'oiseleur '' and '' myrto '' , the last of which is a pre-echo of mélodies by gabriel fauré the opera is sometimes seen as a vehicle for a star soprano , but macdonald writes that the two principal male characters , nilakantha and gérald , are strongly drawn , and the music is '' melodic , picturesque and theatrically strong '' the pianist and musical scholar graham johnson quotes the musicologist fritz noske 's view that delibes ' songs derive from the chansonnette , '' lighter and more entertaining than the romance , and less susceptible to the german influence of the lied ''
