slayter , games ( 11 november 1933 ) '' method & apparatus for making glass wool '' owens joined with the corning company in 1935 and the method was adapted by owens corning to produce its patented '' fiberglas '' ( spelled with one '' s '' ) in 1936 this reduced the insulation properties to values typical of the plastic , but now for the first time , the composite showed great strength and promise as a structural and building material many glass fiber composites continued to be called '' fiberglass '' ( as a generic name ) and the name was also used for the low-density glass wool product containing gas instead of plastic notable progress – the use of plastics , evening post , wellington , new zealand , volume cxxviii , issue 31 , 5 august 1939 , page 28 the first car to have a fiber-glass body was a 1946 prototype of the stout scarab , but the model did not enter production unlike glass fibers used for insulation , for the final structure to be strong , the fiber 's surfaces must be almost entirely free of defects , as this permits the fibers to reach gigapascal tensile strengths if a bulk piece of glass were defect-free , it would be equally as strong as glass fibers ; however , it is generally impractical to produce and maintain bulk material in a defect-free state outside of laboratory conditions the diameter of the filaments , and the number of filaments in the roving , determine its weight , typically expressed in one of two measurement systems : yield , or yards per pound ( the number of yards of fiber in one pound of material ; thus a smaller number means a heavier roving ) these rovings are then either used directly in a composite application such as pultrusion , filament winding ( pipe ) , gun roving ( where an automated gun chops the glass into short lengths and drops it into a jet of resin , projected onto the surface of a mold ) , or in an intermediary step , to manufacture fabrics such as chopped strand mat ( csm ) ( made of randomly oriented small cut lengths of fiber all bonded together ) , woven fabrics , knit fabrics or unidirectional fabrics ensure proper bonding to the resin matrix , thus allowing for the transfer of shear loads from the glass fibers to the thermoset plastic therefore , if a collection of fibers can be arranged permanently in a preferred direction within a material , and if they can be prevented from buckling in compression , the material will be preferentially strong in that direction with chopped strand mat , this directionality is essentially an entire two-dimensional plane ; with woven fabrics or unidirectional layers , directionality of stiffness and strength can be more precisely controlled within the plane a fiberglass component is typically of a thin '' shell '' construction , sometimes filled on the inside with structural foam , as in the case of surfboards for example , in severe temperature conditions ( over 180 & nbsp ; °c ) , the resin component of the composite may lose its functionality , partially due to bond deterioration of resin and fiber other types of glass used are a-glass ( alkali-lime glass with little or no boron oxide ) , e-cr-glass ( electrical/chemical resistance ; alumino-lime silicate with less than 1 % w/w alkali oxides , with high acid resistance ) , c-glass ( alkali-lime glass with high boron oxide content , used for glass staple fibers and insulation ) , d-glass ( borosilicate glass , named for its low dielectric constant ) , r-glass ( alumino silicate glass without mgo and cao with high mechanical requirements as reinforcement ) , and s-glass ( alumino silicate glass without cao but with high mgo content with high tensile strength ) naming and use : pure silica ( silicon dioxide ) , when cooled as fused quartz into a glass with no true melting point , can be used as a glass fiber for fiberglass but has the drawback that it must be worked at very high temperatures ordinary a-glass ( '' a '' for '' alkali-lime '' ) or soda lime glass , crushed and ready to be remelted , as so-called cullet glass , was the first type of glass used for fiberglass s-glass ( '' s '' for '' stiff '' ) is used when tensile strength ( high modulus ) is important and is thus an important building and aircraft epoxy composite ( it is called r-glass , '' r '' for '' reinforcement '' in europe ) c-glass ( '' c '' for '' chemical resistance '' ) and t-glass ( '' t '' is for '' thermal insulator '' —a north american variant of c-glass ) are resistant to chemical attack ; both are often found in insulation-grades of blown fiberglass in the production of some products , such as aircraft , carbon fiber is now used instead of fiberglass , which is stronger by volume and weight it may also be used to conceal other equipment where no signal permeability is required , such as equipment cabinets and steel support structures , due to the ease with which it can be molded and painted to blend with existing structures and surfaces much more reliable tanks are made using woven mat or filament wound fiber , with the fiber orientation at right angles to the hoop stress imposed in the sidewall by the contents such tanks tend to be used for chemical storage because the plastic liner ( often polypropylene ) is resistant to a wide range of corrosive chemicals glass-reinforced plastics are also used to produce house building components such as roofing laminate , door surrounds , over-door canopies , window canopies and dormers , chimneys , coping systems , and heads with keystones and sills fiberglass rods provide an advantage over steel rods because they stretch more elastically ( lower young 's modulus ) than steel for a given weight , meaning more oil can be lifted from the hydrocarbon reservoir to the surface with each stroke , all while reducing the load on the pumping unit ) traffic lights ship hulls rowing shells and oars waterpipes helicopter rotor blades surfboards , tent poles gliders , kit cars , microcars , karts , bodyshells , kayaks , flat roofs , lorries pods , domes and architectural features where a light weight is necessary auto body parts , and entire auto bodies ( e.g sabre sprint , lotus elan , anadol , reliant , quantum quantum coupé , chevrolet corvette and studebaker avanti , and dmc delorean underbody ) antenna covers and structures , such as radomes , uhf broadcasting antennas , and pipes used in hex beam antennas for amateur radio communications frp tanks and vessels : frp is used extensively to manufacture chemical equipment and tanks and vessels most commercial velomobiles most printed circuit boards consist of alternating layers of copper and fiberglass fr-4 large commercial wind turbine blades rf coils used in mri scanners drum sets sub-sea installation protection covers reinforcement of asphalt pavement , as a fabric or mesh interlayer between lifts helmets and other protective gear used in various sports orthopedic casts frp grating is used for walkways on ships and oil rigs , and in factories fiber-reinforced composite columns water slides sculpture making fish ponds or lining cinder block fish ponds once the mandrel is completely covered to the desired thickness , the resin is cured ; often the mandrel is placed in an oven to achieve this , though sometimes radiant heaters are used with the mandrel still turning in the machine for some products such as gas bottles , the 'mandrel ' is a permanent part of the finished product forming a liner to prevent gas leakage or as a barrier to protect the composite from the fluid to be stored products currently being produced using this technique range from pipes , golf clubs , reverse osmosis membrane housings , oars , bicycle forks , bicycle rims , power and transmission poles , pressure vessels to missile casings , aircraft fuselages and lamp posts and yacht masts in some cases , the work is covered with plastic sheets and vacuum is drawn on the work to remove air bubbles and press the fiberglass to the shape of the mold similarly , california 's office of environmental health hazard assessment ( '' oehha '' ) published a november , 2011 modification to its proposition 65 listing to include only '' glass wool fibers ( inhalable and biopersistent ) the national institute for occupational safety and health ( niosh ) has set a recommended exposure limit ( rel ) of 3 fibers/cm 3 ( less than 3.5 micrometers in diameter and greater than 10 micrometers in length ) as a time-weighted average over an 8-hour workday , and a 5 & nbsp ;
