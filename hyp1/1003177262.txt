brown was granted a number of patents on his discovery : gb300311 — a method of and an apparatus or machine for producing force or motion ( accepted 1928-11-15 ) — electrostatic motor ( 1934-09-25 ) — electrokinetic apparatus ( 1960-08-16 ) — electrokinetic transducer ( 1962-01-23 ) — electrokinetic generator ( 1962-02-20 ) — electrokinetic apparatus ( 1965-06-01 ) — electric generator ( 1965-07-20 ) historically , numerous patents have been granted for various applications of the effect , from electrostatic dust precipitation , to air ionizers , and also for flight it is likely that the reason for this is that at very low pressures , only experiments which used very large voltages produced positive results , as a product of a greater chance of ionization of the extremely limited number of available air molecules , and a greater force from each ion from coulomb 's law ; experiments which used lower voltages have a lower chance of ionization and a lower force per ion brown filed another patent in 1960 that detailed the physics of the biefeld–brown effect , making the following claims : there is a negative correlation between the distance between the plates of the capacitor and the strength of the effect , where the shorter the distance , the greater the effect in 2004 , martin tajmar published a paper that also failed to replicate brown 's work and suggested that brown may have instead observed the effects of a corona wind triggered by insufficient outgassing of the electrode assembly in the vacuum chamber and therefore misinterpreted the corona wind effects as a possible connection between gravitation and electromagnetism alt url at some point this effect also gained the moniker '' biefeld–brown effect '' , probably coined by brown to claim denison university professor of physics and astronomy paul alfred biefeld as his mentor and co-experimenter on 15 april 1927 , he applied for a patent , entitled '' method of producing force or motion , '' that described his invention as an electrical-based method that could control gravity to produce linear force or motion there have been follow-ups on the claims that this force can be produced in a full vacuum , meaning it is an unknown anti-gravity force , and not just the more well known ion wind the reduction in force is also a product of the reducing breakdown voltage of air , as a lower potential must be applied between the electrodes , thereby reducing the force dictated by coulomb 's law the article also mentioned the '' gravitator , '' an invention by brown which produced motion without the use of electromagnetism , gears , propellers , or wheels , but instead using the principles of what he called '' electro-gravitation brown believed that his large , high voltage , high capacity capacitors produced an electric field strong enough to marginally interacted with the earth 's gravitational pull , a phenomenon he labeled electrogravitics charles berlitz devoted an entire chapter of his book the philadelphia experiment to a retelling of brown 's early work with the effect , implying he had discovered a new electrogravity effect and that it was being used by ufos around the same time in 2003 , researchers from the army research laboratory ( arl ) tested the biefeld–brown effect by building four different-sized asymmetric capacitors based on simple designs found on the internet and then applying a high voltage of around 30 kv to them there is a positive correlation between the dielectric strength of the material between the electrodes and the strength of the effect , where the higher the strength , the greater the effect
