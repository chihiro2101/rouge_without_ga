later also ford prefect and arthur dent ) that he open doors , check airlocks and pick up pieces of paper '' suddenly , he is kidnapped by a squad of krikkit war robots , who are after his leg , a fragment of the key that will reopen their imprisoned world and restart the genocidal krikkit war '' every part of his body has been replaced , with the exception of '' all the diodes down his left side '' , which have been giving him severe pain for the whole of his existence the original television costume from the 1981 television series was refurbished for a cameo role in the film , standing in a queue in the vogon office on vogsphere , where the main characters are trying to release tricia , with various other life forms as well as in the group near the end of the film according to his autobiography read in the secondary phase of the radio series , marvin was constructed , much against his own wishes , by the sirius cybernetics corporation to prototype human personality artificial intelligence marvin subsequently saves zaphod 's life by engaging in a battle of wits with a vicious ( yet stupid ) automated tank , and then is abandoned on the planet frogstar b when zaphod is sent to the total perspective vortex the crew leave magrathea on the heart of gold , but are teleported summarily to ursa minor beta , where zaphod 's great grandfather , in an apparent fit of vicious humour , forces marvin to accompany zaphod on his mission of self-discovery the song involves marvin describing his views on life ( '' i 'd feel a little better if they broke me up for spares '' , '' if i had my time again , i 'd rather be a lemming '' ) , to a synthesiser backing it was changed to '' marvin '' partly to avoid causing offence , but also because it was pointed out to adams that on radio the name would sound like '' martial '' , which would have undesirable military connotations during an apparently suicidal confrontation with a pair of trigger-happy cops , the crew are teleported directly from magrathea into the future to the restaurant at the end of the universe to find that , in fact , they have n't travelled an inch the song involves marvin describing his woes ( '' my moving parts are in a solid state '' ) and frustrations ( '' you know what really makes me mad ? they clean me with a brillo pad '' ) , to a synthesiser backing marvin 's origins ( including those of the sirius cybernetics corporation , and the hitchhikers handheld device ) are referenced in the 2008 radio series the long dark tea-time of the soul
