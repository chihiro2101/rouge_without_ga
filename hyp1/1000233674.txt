due to heavy competition from monochrome lcds used in laptops of the era and the high costs of plasma display technology , in 1987 ibm planned to shut down its factory in upstate new york , the largest plasma plant in the world , in favor of manufacturing mainframe computers , which would have left development to japanese companies the following ed resolutions were common prior to the introduction of hd displays , but have long been phased out in favor of hd displays , as well as because the overall pixel count in ed displays is lower than the pixel count on sd pal displays ( 853×480 vs 720×576 , respectively ) lcd : which is right for you ? afterdawn.com – plasma display gizmodo – giz explains : plasma tv basics to produce light , the cells need to be driven at a relatively high voltage ( ~300 volts ) and the pressure of the gases inside the cell needs to be low ( ~500 torr ) plasma displays had a better contrast ratio , viewability angle , and less motion blur than the lcds that were available at the time , and were used until the introduction of active-matrix color lcd displays in 1992 by the end of the decade , orange monochrome plasma displays were used in a number of high-end a/c powered portable computers , such as the compaq portable 386 ( 1987 ) and the ibm p75 ( 1990 ) weber , a university of illinois ece phd ( in plasma display research ) and staff scientist working at cerl ( home of the plato system ) co-founded a startup company plasmaco with stephen globus , as well as james kehoe , who was the ibm plant manager , and bought the plant from ibm for us 50,000 it is important to note that plasma displays were developed for ten more years than crts ; it is almost certain that if crts had been developed for as long as plasma displays were , the contrast on crts would have been far better than contrast on the plasma displays lcds using ips technology have the widest angles , but they do not equal the range of plasma primarily due to '' ips glow '' , a generally whitish haze that appears due to the nature of the ips pixel design plasmatvbuyingguide.com – 1024 x 1024 resolution plasma display monitors vs.853 x 480 resolution plasma display monitors modern hdtv plasma televisions usually have a resolution of 1,024×768 found on many 42 & nbsp ; inch plasma screens , 1280×768 , 1,366×768 found on 50 & nbsp ; in , 60 & nbsp ; in , and 65 & nbsp ; in plasma screens , or 1080p found in plasma screen sizes from 42 & nbsp ; inch to 103 & nbsp ; inch this precharging means the cells can not achieve a true black , whereas an led backlit lcd panel can actually turn off parts of the backlight , in '' spots '' or '' patches '' ( this technique , however , does not prevent the large accumulated passive light of adjacent lamps , and the reflection media , from returning values from within the panel ) plasma displays are bright ( 1,000 & nbsp ; lux or higher for the display module ) , have a wide color gamut , and can be produced in fairly large sizes—up to diagonally in a monochrome plasma panel , the gas is mostly neon , and the color is the characteristic orange of a neon lamp ( or sign ) most screens are set to '' vivid '' mode by default in the factory ( which maximizes the brightness and raises the contrast so the image on the screen looks good under the extremely bright lights that are common in big box stores ) , which draws at least twice the power ( around 500–700 watts ) of a '' home '' setting of less extreme brightness until the early 2000s , plasma displays were the most popular choice for hdtv flat panel display as they had many benefits over lcds due to the bistable nature of the color and intensity generating method , some people will notice that plasma displays have a shimmering or flickering effect with a number of hues , intensities and dither patterns the panaplex display , generically referred to as a gas-discharge or gas-plasma display , uses the same technology as later plasma video displays , but began life as a seven-segment display for use in adding machines this decline has been attributed to the competition from liquid crystal ( lcd ) televisions , whose prices have fallen more rapidly than those of the plasma tvs plasmatvbuyingguide.com - plasma tvs at altitude , 2012 for those who wish to listen to am radio , or are amateur radio operators ( hams ) or shortwave listeners ( swl ) , the radio frequency interference ( rfi ) from these devices can be irritating or disabling just as in the fluorescent lamps over an office desk , when a high voltage is applied across the cell , the gas in the cells forms a plasma lcds may use one or two large fluorescent lamps as a backlight source , but the different colors are controlled by lcd units , which in effect behave as gates that allow or block light through red , green , or blue filters on the front of the lcd panel some of the atoms in the gas of a cell then lose electrons and become ionized , which creates an electrically conducting plasma of atoms , free electrons , and ions in this mode , when a group of pixels are run at high brightness ( when displaying white , for example ) for an extended period , a charge build-up in the pixel structure occurs and a ghost image can be seen plasma panels use pulse-width modulation ( pwm ) to control brightness : by varying the pulses of current flowing through the different cells thousands of times per second , the control system can increase or decrease the intensity of each subpixel color to create billions of different combinations of red , green and blue the largest plasma video display in the world at the 2008 consumer electronics show in las vegas , nevada , was a unit manufactured by matsushita electric industrial ( panasonic ) standing 6 & nbsp ; ft ( 180 & nbsp ; cm ) tall by 11 & nbsp ; ft ( 330 & nbsp ; cm ) wide when the uv photon strikes a phosphor molecule , it momentarily raises the energy level of an outer orbit electron in the phosphor molecule , moving the electron from a stable to an unstable state ; the electron then sheds the excess energy as a photon at a lower energy level than uv light ; the lower energy photons are mostly in the infrared range but about 40 % are in the visible light range in the first quarter of 2008 , a comparison of worldwide tv sales broke down to 22.1 million for direct-view crt , 21.1 million for lcd , 2.8 million for plasma , and 0.1 million for rear projection they became popular for their bright orange luminous look and found nearly ubiquitous use throughout the late 1970s and into the 1990s in cash registers , calculators , pinball machines , aircraft avionics such as radios , navigation , and stormscopes ; test equipment such as frequency counters and multimeters ; and generally anything that previously used nixie tube or numitron displays with a high digit-count more recent lcd panels using led illumination can automatically reduce the backlighting on darker scenes , though this method can not be used in high-contrast scenes , leaving some light showing from black parts of an image with bright parts , such as ( at the extreme ) a solid black screen with one fine intense bright line some displays , using many different technologies , have some '' leakage '' of light , through either optical or electronic means , from lit pixels to adjacent pixels so that dark pixels that are near bright ones appear less dark than they do during a full-off display most have discontinued doing so , but at one time or another all of these companies have produced products containing plasma displays : beko ( known sometimes as grundig ) fujitsu ( only produced panels funai gradiente chunghwa picture tubes ( only produced panels ) formosa plastics ( only produced panels ) hitachi ( produced panels ) jvc lanix lg ( produced panels ) magnavox marantz nec ( only produced panels ) orion panasonic ( produced panels ) philips pioneer ( produced panels ) proscan protron samsung ( produced panels ) sanyo sony bravia ( produced panels ) toshiba ( produced panels ) vestel ( both under vestel name but also under various brands ) panasonic was the biggest plasma display manufacturer until 2013 , when it decided to discontinue plasma production generally , the higher the contrast ratio , the more realistic the image is ( though the '' realism '' of an image depends on many factors including color accuracy , luminance linearity , and spatial linearity ) however , unlike burn-in , this charge build-up is transient and self-corrects after the image condition that caused the effect has been removed and a long enough period has passed ( with the display either off or on ) high strain point glass is normally necessary because plasma displays have to be baked during manufacture to dry the rare-earth phosphors after they are applied to the display some manufacturers have reduced the precharge and the associated background glow , to the point where black levels on modern plasmas are starting to become close to some high-end crts sony and mitsubishi produced ten years before the comparable plasma displays plasma manufacturers have tried various ways of reducing burn-in such as using gray pillarboxes , pixel orbiters and image washing routines , but none to date have eliminated the problem and all plasma manufacturers continue to exclude burn-in from their warranties beyond plasma 's deeper blacks , increased contrast , faster response time , greater color spectrum , and wider viewing angle ; they were also much bigger than lcds , and it was believed that lcds were suited only to smaller sized televisions early plasma televisions were enhanced-definition ( ed ) with a native resolution of 840×480 ( discontinued ) or 853×480 , and down-scaled their incoming high-definition video signals to match their native display resolution doi:10.1889/1.1832431 in late 2006 , analysts noted that lcds had overtaken plasmas , particularly in the 40-inch ( 100 & nbsp ; cm ) and above segment where plasma had previously gained market share
