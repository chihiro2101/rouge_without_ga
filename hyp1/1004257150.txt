māori often call themselves '' tangata whenua '' ( people of the land ) , placing particular importance on a lifestyle connected to land and sea the distinct values , history , and worldview of māori are expressed through traditional arts and skills such as haka , tā moko , waiata , carving , weaving , and poi the concept of tapu ( meaning taboo or sacred ) is also a strong force in māori culture , applied to objects , people , or even mountains however their population began to increase again from the late nineteenth century , and a cultural revival began in the 1960s , sometimes known as the māori renaissance pākehā culture ( usually synonymous with new zealand european culture ) derives mainly from that of the british , particularly english settlers who colonised new zealand in the nineteenth century until about the 1950s many pākehā saw themselves as a british people , and retained strong cultural ties to '' mother england '' part of the problem is that high culture is often mistaken for culture in general , and the lack of recognition historically given to new zealand 's artists , writers and composers is seen as evidence of a lack of culture others argue that belief in the 'absence ' of culture in nz is a symptom of white privilege , allowing members of a dominant group to see their culture as 'normal ' or 'default ' , rather than as a specific position of relative advantage miranda johnson ( 2005 ) , ' '' the land of the wrong white cloud '' : anti-racist organizations and pakeha identity politics in the 1970s ' , new zealand journal of history , 39 , 2 , pp.137–57 there was an interest in '' kiwiana '' —items from new zealand 's heritage that are seen as representing iconic kiwi elements , such as the pohutakawa ( new zealand christmas tree ) , pāua-shell ash-tray , buzzy bee , pineapple lumps , gumboots and jandals from the mid twentieth century on , waves of immigrants have entered the country from different ethnic backgrounds , notable dutch and central europeans during the 1950s , pacific islanders since the 1960s , and northern chinese , indians , and southeast asians since the 1980s various aspects of each culture have added to new zealand culture ; chinese new year is celebrated for example , especially in auckland and dunedin , and south auckland has strong samoan cultural links two of the major ones are polyfest , which showcases performances of the secondary school cultural groups in the auckland region , and pasifika , a festival that celebrates pacific island heritage through traditional food , music , dance , and entertainment the popular music style of urban pasifika also has its origins in the new zealand pacific island community , and has become a major strand in new zealand music culture pacific island heritage is also celebrated in much of new zealand 's fine art , with notable artists such as fatu feu ' u , lily laita , john pule , yuki kihara , and michel tuffery all heavily influenced by their pacific origins from the 1830s many māori nominally converted to christianity and in the process learned to read and write , by the late nineteenth century new zealand when formal schooling finished for most at 12 , māori were as likely to be literate as pākehā similarly māori traditional chants were put to victorian music , or written to european tunes , european designs and metal tools adopted by carvers , altering their style and british fabrics and cloth , such as blanketing adopted to form new dress after the defeat of rebel māori who attempted to establish a renegade state in the king country , the adoption of pākehā culture became less of a free choice as pākehā began to outnumber māori māori traditional culture became less critical in normal everyday life as advanced western technology- electricity , lights telegraphy , roads , mass production radio , aeroplanes and refrigeration made most aspects of māori culture redundant but was still practised at events such as tangihanga ( funerals ) the most famous example of this is the haka of the all blacks , a māori posture dance which is performed before international rugby matches ( there are many non-māori polynesian all blacks , thus making this a multi-ethnic borrowing ) however pākehā artists such as colin mccahon and gordon walters have also incorporated māori motifs into their art , and a number of early pākehā writers used māori themes and topics in an effort to create an authentically new zealand literature walker , ranginui ( 1990 ) , ka whawhai tonu matou : struggle without end , pp.221–5 most pākehā are now more respectful of māori culture and often consult māori before using māori cultural forms in the performance of traditional māori musical instruments richard nunns has earned wide respect , as have the contributions made by many academics , for example , dame anne salmond in the area of traditional rituals of encounter , or mervyn mclean in the analysis of traditional song since the 2000s , dubstep , drum and bass , jungle trance and related subgenres , derived from england , has been further developed by new zealanders into a unique sound , exemplified by salmonella dub , shapeshifter and many others in general , the development of international mass media and mass communication has meant new zealanders have always been aware of developments in other countries ; this lends itself to the adoption of new forms and styles from overseas new zealand english is close to australian english in pronunciation , but has several differences often overlooked by people from outside these countries the most prominent differences between the new zealand english dialect and other english dialects are the shifts in the short front vowels : the short- '' i '' sound ( as in '' kit '' ) has centralised towards the schwa sound ( the '' a '' in '' comma '' and '' about '' ) ; the short- '' e '' sound ( as in '' dress '' ) has moved towards the short- '' i '' sound ; and the short- '' a '' sound ( as in '' trap '' ) has moved to the short- '' e '' sound an eastern polynesian language , te reo māori , is closely related to tahitian and cook islands māori ; slightly less closely to hawaiian and marquesan ; and more distantly to the languages of western polynesia , including samoan , niuean and tongan historically , there were distinct dialects of te reo , most notably a softer version associated with the southern extreme of the country , though these have been almost completely subsumed by a standardised dialect originally found around the waikato area new zealand sign language has its roots in british sign language ( bsl ) , and may be technically considered a dialect of british , australian and new zealand sign language ( banzsl ) as recorded in the 2013 census , samoan is the most widely spoken non-official language ( 2.2 % ) , followed by hindi ( 1.7 % ) , '' northern chinese '' ( including mandarin , 1.3 % ) and french ( 1.2 % ) the haka ( often mistaken as always being a war dance or ritual challenge ) has become part of wider new zealand culture , being performed by the all blacks as a group ritual before international games and by homesick new zealanders of all races who want to express their new zealandness new zealand drama , both on stage and screen , has been plagued during much of its history by cost and lack of popular interest in new zealand culture in recent decades new zealand film has grown dramatically , with the films once were warriors , the piano and heavenly creatures doing well both locally and internationally , and the lord of the rings trilogy director peter jackson becoming one of film 's most successful directors new zealand music has been influenced by blues , jazz , country , rock and roll and hip hop , with many of these genres given a unique new zealand interpretation reggae is also popular within some communities , with bands such as herbs , katchafire , 1814 , house of shem , unity pacific all reflecting their roots , perspectives and cultural pride and heritage through their music a number of popular artists have gone on to achieve international success including lorde , split enz , crowded house , omc , bic runga , kimbra , ladyhawke , the naked and famous , fat freddy 's drop , savage , alien weaponry , flight of the conchords , and brooke fraser the national rugby union team is called the all blacks and has the best winning record of any national team in the world , including being the inaugural winners of the world cup in 1987 some of the earliest european settlers in new zealand were christian missionaries , mostly from the church of england but also from protestant denominations and the catholic church it has also been evidenced that new zealand 's lack of religion correlates with income and income correlates with urban location ; in auckland , for example , the richest suburbs are the least religious newer immigrants are more religious and more diverse than previous groups according to the 2013 census , the number of people who affiliated with a christian denomination ( including māori christian ) decreased to 1,906,398 ( 48.9 % of all people who stated their religious affiliation ) , down from 2,082,942 ( 55.6 % ) in 2006 the evidence for this was the relatively small range of wealth ( that is , the wealthiest did not earn hugely more than the poorest earners ) , lack of deference to authority figures , high levels of class mobility , a high standard of working class living compared to britain , progressive labour laws which protected workers and encouraged unionism , state housing , and a welfare state which was developed in new zealand before most other countries '' does nz still cut down tall poppies ? '' , 18 march 2013 , adrien taylor , 3news.co.nz it has been argued that in new zealand ethnicity takes the place of class , with māori and other polynesians earning less , having a lower standard of living and less education , and working in lower status jobs than pākehā new zealand 's claims to be a classless society were dealt a fatal blow in the 1980s and 1990s by the economic reforms of the fourth labour government and its successor , the fourth national government these reforms led to a dramatic increase in the gap between the richest and poorest new zealanders , and an increase in the numbers living in poverty the length of the visit can range from a few months to the remainder of the visitor 's life ; since many new zealanders have british ancestry or dual citizenship ( sometimes as a result of their parents ' oe ) , the restrictions on working in britain do not apply to a substantial percentage of them because australia is relatively close to new zealand and has no restrictions on new zealanders working there , the new zealanders working in australia are more diverse than those in other countries , with a significantly higher proportion of māori and working-class people since the signing of the trans-tasman travel arrangement in 1973 , new zealanders have had the right to live and work in australia on equal terms with australian citizens changes to british immigration law in this period required new zealanders to obtain visas to work in britain or live there for extended periods , unless they had recent british ancestry such agreements are in place with : argentina , belgium , brazil , canada , chile , czech republic , denmark , finland , france , germany , hong kong , republic of ireland , italy , japan , south korea , malaysia , malta , mexico , netherlands , norway , singapore , spain , sweden , taiwan , thailand , the united kingdom and uruguay the stereotypical new zealand male is essentially a pioneer type : he is perceived to be rural , strong , unemotional , democratic , has little time for high culture , good with animals ( particularly horses ) and machines , and is able to turn his hand to nearly anything this type of man is often presumed to be a unique product of new zealand 's colonial period but he shares many similarities with the stereotypical american frontiersman and australian bushman social reforms pioneered by new zealand include women 's suffrage , the welfare state , and respect for indigenous peoples ( through the treaty of waitangi and the waitangi tribunal ) having led the ( non-communist ) world in economic regulation from the 1930s , in the 1980s and 1990s the reforms of the labour government led the world in economic de-regulation new zealanders , both those of pākehā and māori roots , have been described as an individualistic people , who take intrusion very personally , especially when it occurs onto private land ( but also sometimes in a wider sense ) according to psychologists , this is rooted respectively in the 'frontier ' image of the european settler culture , but also mirrored amongst the māori , for whom land holds a lot of spiritual value in addition to its commercial use the new zealand human rights commission was established by the race relations act in 1971 for the purposes of '' promoting positive race relations and addressing complaints of discrimination on grounds of race , colour , and ethnic or national origin '' , and was merged with the human rights commission in january 2002 following the arrival of british settlers , māori adopted many of their foods , especially pork and potatoes , the latter of which transformed the māori agricultural economy in everyday life the two foods of māori origin are '' the boil up '' ( boiled up left over food meat and vegetable scraps sometimes thickened with flour ) , and the hāngi which is associated with special occasions new zealanders increasingly come from many ethnic backgrounds , and most immigrants to new zealand have tried to reproduce their native cuisines or national dishes in new zealand architecture of new zealand national symbols of new zealand demographics of new zealand history of new zealand public holidays in new zealand culture of australia etiquette in australia and new zealand christmas in new zealand
