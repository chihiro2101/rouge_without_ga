it appears , by a vast number of experiments made at peking , that its colour is owing to no mixture ; on the contrary , all mixtures diminish its beauty , for , when it is rightly managed it looks exactly like silver and were there not a necessity of mixing a little tutenag or such metal to soften it , it would be so much more the extraordinary as this sort of copper is found no where but in china and that only in the province of yunnan '' aside from cupronickel and copper-nickel , several other terms have been used to describe the material : the tradenames alpaka or alpacca , argentan minargent , the registered french term cuivre blanc , and the romanized cantonese term paktong , 白銅 ( the french and cantonese terms both meaning '' white copper '' ) ; cupronickel is also occasionally referred to as hotel silver , plata alemana ( spanish for '' german silver '' ) , german silver , and chinese silver in 1973 , cheng and schwitter in their new analyses suggested that the bactrian alloys ( copper , lead , iron , nickel and cobalt ) were closely similar to the chinese paktong , and of nine known asian nickel deposits , only those in china could provide the identical chemical compositions notwithstanding what is here said , of the colour of the copper being owing to no mixture , it is certain the chinese white copper as brought to us , is a mixt sic : mixed metal ; so that the ore from which it was extracted must consist of various metallic substances ; and from such ore that the natural orichalcum if it ever existed , was made the ore used is noted as solely available from yunnan , according to the story : '' san mao chun were at tanyang during a famine year when many people died , so taking certain chemicals , ying projected them onto silver , turning it into gold , and he also transmuted iron into silver & nbsp ; – thus enabling the lives of many to be saved through purchasing grain through this fake silver and gold thereafter all those who prepared chemical powders by heating and transmuting copper by projection called their methods '' tanyang techniques '' kobelco : copper alloy tubes for heat-exchanger ; shinko metal products , japan ; important marine applications for cupronickel include : shipbuilding and repair : hulls of boats and ships , seawater cooling , bilge and ballast , sanitary , fire fighting , inert gas , hydraulic and pneumatic chiller systems currently , some circulating coins , such as the united states jefferson nickel ( 5¢ ) , the swiss franc , and the south korean 500 and 100 won are made of solid cupronickel ( 75:25 ratio ) it is commonly used for mechanical and electrical equipment , medical equipment , zippers , jewelry items , and both for strings for instruments in the violin family , and for guitar frets the theory of chinese origins of bactrian cupronickel was suggested in 1868 by flight , who found that the coins considered the oldest cupronickel coins yet discovered were of a very similar alloy to chinese paktong '' however , the pha phu tsu and the shen i ching describing a statue in the western provinces as being of silver , tin , lead and tanyang copper & nbsp ; – which looked like gold , and could be forged for plating and inlaying vessels and swords applications for cu–ni alloys have withstood the test of time , as they are still widely used and range from seawater system piping , condensers and heat exchangers in naval vessels , commercial shipping , multiple-stage flash desalination and power stations the successful use of cupronickel in coinage is due to its corrosion resistance , electrical conductivity , durability , malleability , low allergy risk , ease of stamping , antimicrobial properties and recyclability details of fabrication procedures , including general handling , cutting and machining , forming , heat treatment , preparing for welding , weld preparations , tack welding , welding consumables , welding processes , paintina , mechanical properties of welds , and tube and pipe bending are available to use this property to its full potential , the alloy needs to be free of the effects of , or insulated from , any form of cathodic protection appeared from a vast series of experiments made at peking- that it occurred naturally as an ore mined at the region , the most extraordinary copper is pe-tong or white copper : it is white when dug out of the mine and even more white within than without important properties of cupronickel alloys include corrosion resistance , inherent resistance to macrofouling , good tensile strength , excellent ductility when annealed , thermal conductivity and expansion characteristics amenable for heat exchangers and condensers , good thermal conductivity and ductility at cryogenic temperatures and beneficial antimicrobial touch surface properties cryogenic properties of copper-nickel properties of copper and copper alloys properties of copper and copper alloys at low temperatures beginning around the turn of the 20th century , bullet jackets were commonly made from this material cupronickel lacks a copper color due to nickel 's high electronegativity , which causes a loss of one electron in copper 's d-shell ( leaving 9 electrons in the d-shell versus pure copper 's typical 10 electrons ) however , it is first mentioned specifically by name in the thien kung khai wu of circa 1637 : '' when lu kan shih ( zinc carbonate , calamine ) or wo chhein ( zinc metal ) is mixed and combined with chih thung ( copper ) , one gets 'yellow bronze ' ( ordinary brass ) copper-nickel alloys in power generation seawater system components : condenser and heat exchanger tubes , tubesheets , piping , high pressure systems , fittings , pumps , and water boxes copper-nickel alloys copper-nickel-alloys : properties , processing , applications ( source : german copper institute ( dki ) ) ] copper-nickel alloys for seawater corrosion resistance and antifouling - a state of the art review ( c.a but in de natura metallorum in singalarum part 1 , published in 1599 , the same term was applied to '' tin '' from the east indies ( modern-day indonesia and the philippines ) and given the spanish name , tintinaso peat and cookson found that '' the darkest proved to contain 7.7 % nickel and the lightest said to be indistinguishable from silver with a characteristic bell-like resonance when struck and considerable resistance to corrosion , 11.1 % '' in part due to silver hoarding in the civil war , the united states mint first used cupronickel for circulating coinage in three-cent pieces starting in 1865 , and then for five-cent pieces starting in 1866 soon afterwards , a 2 % manganese and 2 % iron alloy now known as alloy c71640 was introduced for a uk power station which needed better erosion resistance because the levels of entrained sand in the seawater a 90–10 alloy first became available in the 1950s , initially for seawater piping , and is now the more widely used alloy
