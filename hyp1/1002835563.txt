his 1759 paper '' an experimental enquiry concerning the natural powers of water and wind to turn mills and other machines depending on circular motion '' addressed the relationship between pressure and velocity for objects moving in air ( smeaton noted that the table doing so was actually contributed by '' my friend mr rouse '' '' an ingenious gentleman of harborough , leicestershire '' and calculated on the basis of rouse 's experiments ) , and his concepts were subsequently developed to devise the 'smeaton coefficient' structure details : chimney mill smeaton 's profile at the bbc john smeaton : the aviation history online museum john smeaton 's model for the foundation of the eddystone lighthouse ( leeds museums and galleries '' secret life of objects '' blog ) john smeaton a narrative of the building and a description of the construction of the edystone lighthouse ( 1791 and 1793 editions ) – linda hall library deciding that he wanted to focus on the lucrative field of civil engineering , he commenced an extensive series of commissions , including : the calder and hebble navigation ( 1758–70 ) coldstream bridge over the river tweed ( 1763–66 ) improvements to the river lee navigation ( 1765–70 ) smeaton 's pier in st ives , cornwall ( 1767–70 ) perth bridge over the river tay in perth ( 1766–71 ) ripon canal ( 1766–1773 ) smeaton 's viaduct , which carries the a616 road ( part of the original great north road ) over the river trent between newark and south muskham in nottinghamshire ( 1768–70 ) the forth and clyde canal from grangemouth to glasgow ( 1768–77 ) langley on tyne smelt mill , with nicholas walton , acting as receivers to the greenwich hospital , london ( 1768 ) '' the greenwich hospital smelt mill at langley , northumberland 1768–1780 '' by f image : smeaton 's lighthouse00.jpg thumb right smeaton 's lighthouse smeaton is important in the history , rediscovery of , and development of modern cement , identifying the compositional requirements needed to obtain '' hydraulicity '' in lime ; work which led ultimately to the invention of portland cement it has the form : : l k v^2 a c_l \ , where : : l is the lift : k is the smeaton coefficient ( see note below ) : v is the velocity : a is the area in square feet : c_l is the lift coefficient ( the lift relative to the drag of a plate of the same area ) the wright brothers determined with wind tunnels that the smeaton coefficient value of 0.005 was incorrect and should have been 0.0033 in his 1759 paper '' an experimental enquiry concerning the natural powers of water and wind to turn mills and other machines depending on circular motion '' smeaton developed the concepts and data which became the basis for the smeaton coefficient , the lift equation used by the wright brothers the society was a forerunner of the institution of civil engineers , established in 1818 , and was renamed the smeatonian society of civil engineers in 1830 he pioneered the use of 'hydraulic lime ' ( a form of mortar that will set under water ) and developed a technique involving dovetailed blocks of granite in the building of the lighthouse employing his skills as a mechanical engineer , he devised a water engine for the royal botanic gardens at kew in 1761 and a watermill at alston , cumbria in 1767 ( he is credited by some with inventing the cast-iron axle shaft for water wheels ) he is mentioned in the song '' i predict a riot '' ( as a symbol of a more dignified and peaceful epoch in leeds history ; and in reference to a junior school house at leeds grammar school , which lead singer ricky wilson attended ) by the indie rock band kaiser chiefs , who are natives of leeds
