in the idealized cubic unit cell of such a compound , the type ' a ' atom sits at cube corner position ( 0 , 0 , 0 ) , the type ' b ' atom sits at the body-center position ( 1/2 , 1/2 , 1/2 ) and oxygen atoms sit at face centered positions ( 1/2 , 1/2 , 0 ) , ( 1/2 , 0 , 1/2 ) and ( 0 , 1/2 , 1/2 ) three general categories of cation-pairing are possible : a 2+ b 4+ x 2− 3 , or 2:4 perovskites ; a 3+ b 3+ x 2− 3 , or 3:3 perovskites ; and a + b 5+ x 2− 3 , or 1:5 perovskites ruddlesden−popper phases have a similar relationship to perovskites in terms of atomic radii of elements with a typically being large ( such as la or sr ) with the b ion being much smaller typically a transition metal ( such as mn , co or ni ) dion−jacobson phase : the intruding layer is composed of an alkali metal ( m ) every n layers , giving the overall formula as ruddlesden-popper phase : the simplest of the phases , the intruding layer occurs between every one ( n 1 ) or two ( n 2 ) layers of the lattice the perovskite structure is adopted at high pressure by bridgmanite , a silicate with the formula ( mg , fe ) sio 3 , which is the most common mineral in the earth 's mantle different forms of intrusions , based on the chemical makeup of the intrusion , are defined as : aurivillius phase : the intruding layer is composed of a 2+ ion , occurring every n layers , leading to an overall chemical formula of - the relative ion size requirements for stability of the cubic structure are quite stringent , so slight buckling and distortion can produce several lower-symmetry distorted versions , in which the coordination numbers of a cations , b cations or both are reduced an even more exotic type of perovskite is represented by the mixed oxide-aurides of cs and rb , such as cs 3 auo , which contain large alkali cations in the traditional '' anion '' sites , bonded to o 2− and au − anions physical properties of interest to materials science among perovskites include superconductivity , magnetoresistance , ionic conductivity , and a multitude of dielectric properties , which are of great importance in microelectronics and telecommunication although the stability of perovskite leds is not yet as good as iii-v or organic leds , there are plenty of ongoing research to solve this problem , such as incorporating organic molecules or potassium dopants in perovskite leds described nanostructured cells using a mixed methylammonium lead halide ( ch 3 nh 3 pbi 3−x cl x ) and demonstrated one amorphous thin-film solar cell with an 11.4 % conversion efficiency , and another that reached 15.4 % using vacuum evaporation at the pressure and temperature conditions of the lower mantle , the second most abundant material is likely the rock-salt structure ( mg , fe ) o oxide , periclase these include tilting of the octahedra , displacements of the cations out of the centers of their coordination polyhedra , and distortions of the octahedra driven by electronic factors ( jahn–teller effect ) at the high pressure conditions of the earth 's lower mantle , the pyroxene enstatite , mgsio 3 , transforms into a denser perovskite-structured polymorph ; this phase may be the most common mineral in the earth in 2014 it was shown that mixed methylammonium lead halide ( ch 3 nh 3 pbi 3−x cl x ) cells fashioned into optically pumped vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers ( vcsels ) convert visible pump light to near-ir laser light with a 70 % efficiency because of the flexibility of bond angles inherent in the perovskite structure there are many different types of distortions which can occur from the ideal structure synthetic perovskites have been identified as possible inexpensive base materials for high-efficiency commercial photovoltaics – they showed a conversion efficiency of up to 25.5 % reported in 2020 by nrel and can be manufactured using the same thin-film manufacturing techniques as that used for thin film silicon solar cells an example of this is laalo 3 grown on srtio 3 , where the interface can exhibit conductivity , even though both laalo 3 and srtio 3 is non-conductive the diagram to the right shows edges for an equivalent unit cell with a in the cube corner position , b at the body center , and o at face-centered positions
