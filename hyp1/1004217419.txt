typical operations performed under conduction anesthesia include : dentistry ( surface anesthesia , infiltration anesthesia or intraligamentary anesthesia during restorative operations such as fillings , crowns , and root canals , or extractions , and regional nerve blocks during extractions and surgeries ) podiatry ( cutaneous , nail avulsions , matricectomy , bunionectomy , hammertoe repair and various other podiatric procedures ) eye surgery ( surface anesthesia with topical anesthetics or retrobulbar block during cataract removal or other ophthalmic procedures ) ent operations , head and neck surgery ( infiltration anesthesia , field blocks , or peripheral nerve blocks , plexus anesthesia ) shoulder and arm surgery ( plexus anesthesia or intravenous regional anesthesia ) heart and lung surgery ( epidural anesthesia combined with general anesthesia ) abdominal surgery ( epidural anesthesia/spinal anesthesia , often combined with general anesthesia during inguinal hernia repair or other abdominal surgery ) gynecological , obstetrical , and urological operations ( spinal/epidural anesthesia ) bone and joint surgery of the pelvis , hip , and leg ( spinal/epidural anesthesia , peripheral nerve blocks , or intravenous regional anesthesia ) surgery of skin and peripheral blood vessels ( topical anesthesia , field blocks , peripheral nerve blocks , or spinal/epidural anesthesia ) examples include : prilocaine hydrochloride and epinephrine ( trade name citanest forte ) lidocaine , bupivacaine , and epinephrine ( recommended final concentrations of 0.5 , 0.25 , and 0.5 % , respectively ) iontocaine , consisting of lidocaine and epinephrine septocaine ( trade name septodont ) , a combination of articaine and epinephrine one combination product of this type is used topically for surface anaesthesia , tac ( 5-12 % tetracaine , 1 / 2000 ( 0.05 % , 500 ppm , Â½ per mille ) adrenaline , 4 or 10 % cocaine ) : lidocaine/prilocaine ( emla , eutectic mixture of local anesthetic ) lidocaine/tetracaine ( rapydan ) tac la solutions for injection are sometimes mixed with vasoconstrictors ( combination drug ) to increase the duration of local anesthesia by constricting the blood vessels , thereby safely concentrating the anesthetic agent for an extended duration , as well as reducing hemorrhage type b fibers ( sympathetic tone ) are the most sensitive followed by type c ( pain ) , type a delta ( temperature ) , type a gamma ( proprioception ) , type a beta ( sensory touch and pressure ) , and type a alpha ( motor ) clinical techniques include : surface anesthesia is the application of an la spray , solution , or cream to the skin or a mucous membrane ; the effect is short lasting and is limited to the area of contact the commonly held belief that la with vasoconstrictor can cause necrosis in extremities such as the nose , ears , fingers , and toes ( due to constriction of end arteries ) , is invalidated , since no case of necrosis has been reported since the introduction of commercial lidocaine with epinephrine in 1948 transincision ( or transwound ) catheter anesthesia uses a multilumen catheter inserted through an insicion or wound and aligned across it on the inside as the incision or wound is closed , providing continuous administration of local anesthetic along the incision or wounds dental-specific techniques include : infiltration anesthesia is infiltration of la into the tissue to be anesthetized ; surface and infiltration anesthesia are collectively topical anesthesia field block is subcutaneous injection of an la in an area bordering on the field to be anesthetized some typical uses of conduction anesthesia for acute pain are : labor pain ( epidural anesthesia , pudendal nerve blocks ) postoperative pain ( peripheral nerve blocks , epidural anesthesia ) trauma ( peripheral nerve blocks , intravenous regional anesthesia , epidural anesthesia ) hence , it is crucial for the medical professional administrating the local anaesthesia , especially in the form of an injection , to ensure that the patient is in a comfortable setting and has any potential fears alleviated in order to avoid these possible complications epidural anesthesia is an la injected into the epidural space , where it acts primarily on the spinal nerve roots ; depending on the site of injection and the volume injected , the anesthetized area varies from limited areas of the abdomen or chest to large regions of the body spinal anesthesia is an la injected into the cerebrospinal fluid , usually at the lumbar spine ( in the lower back ) , where it acts on spinal nerve roots and part of the spinal cord ; the resulting anesthesia usually extends from the legs to the abdomen or chest intravenous regional anesthesia ( bier 's block ) is when blood circulation of a limb is interrupted using a tourniquet ( a device similar to a blood-pressure cuff ) , then a large volume of la is injected into a peripheral vein disadvantages : risk of temporary periodontal tissue damage , likelihood of bacteriemia and endocarditis for at-risk populations , appropriate pressure and correct needle placement are imperative for anesthetic success , short duration of pulpal anesthesia limits the use of ilis for several restorative procedures that require longer duration , postoperative discomfort , and injury on unerupted teeth such as enamel hypoplasia and defects diagnostic tests such as bone marrow aspiration , lumbar puncture ( spinal tap ) and aspiration of cysts or other structures are made to be less painful upon administration of local anesthetic before insertion of larger needles spinal anesthesia was first used in 1885 , but not introduced into clinical practice until 1899 , when august bier subjected himself to a clinical experiment in which he observed the anesthetic effect , but also the typical side effect of postpunctural headache plexus anesthesia is injection of la in the vicinity of a nerve plexus , often inside a tissue compartment that limits the diffusion of the drug away from the intended site of action local anesthetic solutions for injection typically consist of : the local anesthetic agent itself a vehicle , which is usually water-based or just sterile water vasoconstrictor possibly ( see below ) reducing agent ( antioxidant ) , e.g though many other drugs also have membrane-stabilizing properties , not all are used as las ( propranolol , for example , though it has la properties ) las can be applied repeatedly or continuously for prolonged periods to relieve chronic pain , usually in combination with medication such as opioids , nsaids , and anticonvulsants saxitoxin neosaxitoxin tetrodotoxin menthol eugenol cocaine spilanthol most naturally occurring local anesthetics with the exceptions of menthol , eugenol and cocaine are neurotoxins , and have the suffix -toxin in their names the invention of clinical use of local anaesthesia is credited to the vienna school which included sigmund freud ( 1856-1939 ) , carl koller ( 1857-1944 ) and leopold konigstein ( 1850-1942 ) despite this , risks of toxicity may be higher in pregnancy due to an increase in unbound fraction of local anesthetic and physiological changes increase the transfer of local anesthetic into the central nervous system it was also used for slave payment and is thought to play a role in the subsequent destruction of incas culture when spaniards realized the effects of chewing the coca leaves and took advantage of it in peru , the ancient incas are believed to have used the leaves of the coca as a local anaesthetic in addition to its stimulant properties topical anesthesia , in the form of lidocaine/prilocaine ( emla ) is most commonly used to enable relatively painless venipuncture ( blood collection ) and placement of intravenous cannulae surface anesthesia also facilitates some endoscopy procedures such as bronchoscopy ( visualization of the lower airways ) or cystoscopy ( visualization of the inner surface of the bladder ) because the vasoconstrictor temporarily reduces the rate at which the systemic circulation removes the local anesthetic from the area of the injection , the maximum doses of las when combined with a vasoconstrictor is higher compared to the same la without any vasoconstrictor advantages of ili over inab : rapid onset ( within 30 seconds ) , small dosage required ( 0.2-1.0ml ) , limited area of numbness , lower intrinsic risks such as neuropathy , hematoma , trismus/jaw sprain and self-inflicted periodontal tissue injury , nelson pw once inside the cell , the local anesthetic will be in equilibrium , with the formation of the protonated ( ionized ) form , which does not readily pass back out of the cell small and large peripheral nerves can be anesthetized individually ( peripheral nerve block ) or in anatomic nerve bundles ( plexus anesthesia ) the intraligamentary syringe offers mechanical advantage by using a trigger-grasp or click apparatus to employ a gear or lever that improves control and results in increased force to push the anesthetic cartridge 's rubber stopper forward for medication deposition with greater ease local anesthesia is also used during insertion of iv devices , such as pacemakers and implantable defibrillators , ports used for giving chemotherapy medications and hemodialysis access catheters even with proper administration , it is inevitable for some diffusion of agent into the body from the site of application due to unforeseeable anatomical idiosyncrasies of the patient all nerve fibers are sensitive to las , but due to a combination of diameter and myelination , fibers have different sensitivities to la blockade , termed differential blockade since then , several synthetic local anesthetic drugs have been developed and put into clinical use , notably lidocaine in 1943 , bupivacaine in 1957 , and prilocaine in 1959 this theory is compatible with two studies on lipid rescue for clomipramine toxicity in rabbits and with a clinical report on the use of lipid rescue in veterinary medicine to treat a puppy with moxidectin toxicosis peripheral nerve block is injection of la in the vicinity of a peripheral nerve to anesthetize that nerve 's area of innervation evidence indicates intralipid , a commonly available intravenous lipid emulsion , can be effective in treating severe cardiotoxicity secondary to local anesthetic overdose , including human case reports of successful use in this way ( lipid rescue ) thorough evaluation of the disease should be carried out to assess potential risk to the patient as in significant liver dysfunction , the half-life of amide local anaesthetic agents may be drastically increased thus increasing the risk of overdose though it can be easily performed , repeated local anaesthetic blocks in chronic pain conditions are not recommended as there is no evidence of long-term benefits it is mostly used in patients who have limited opening of the mandible or in those that have trismus ; spasm of the muscles of mastication the search for a less toxic and less addictive substitute led to the development of the aminoester local anesthetics stovaine in 1903 and procaine in 1904 intraligamentary infiltration , also known as periodontal ligament injection or intraligamentary injection ( ilis ) , is known as â the most universal of the supplemental injections â this can be a factor in choosing an agent in patients with liver failure , although since cholinesterases are produced in the liver , physiologically ( e.g though most reports to date have used intralipid , a commonly available intravenous lipid emulsion , other emulsions , such as liposyn and medialipid , have also been shown effective
