in the 2017 new zealand election , 27.33 % of voters split their vote ( voted for a local candidate of a different party than their party vote ) compared to 31.64 % in 2014 in each constituency , the representative is chosen using a single winner method , typically first-past-the-post ( that is , the candidate with the most votes , by plurality , wins ) in most jurisdictions , candidates may stand for both a constituency and on a party list ( referred to in new zealand as dual candidacy ) , but in wales are restricted to contend either for a constituency or for a party list , but not both if a candidate is on the party list , but wins a constituency seat , they do not receive two seats ; they are instead crossed off the party list and the party seat goes to the next candidate down a regional open list method was recommended for the united kingdom by the jenkins commission ( where it is known as ams ) and for canada by the law commission of canada ; neither recommendation was ever implemented in baden-württemberg , there are no lists ; they use the '' best near-winner '' method in a four-region model , where the regional members are the local candidates of the under-represented party in that region who received the most votes in their local constituency without being elected in it above the constituency level ) several different calculation methods have been used , but the basic characteristic of the mmp is that the total number of seats in the assembly , including the single-member seats and not only the party-list ones , are allocated to parties proportionally to the number of votes the party received in the party portion of the ballot for example , in the 2008 new zealand general election the māori party won 2.4 % of the party vote , which would entitle them to 0 seats in the house , but won 5 constituency seats , leaving an overhang of 2 seats , which resulted in a 122-member house if a party wins more local seats than its proportion of the total vote justifies , the size of the landtag increases so that the total outcome is fully proportional to the votes , with other parties receiving additional list seats to achieve proportionality the list allocation for those parliaments works like a mixed member majoritarian system , but in using the d'hondt method 's divisors to find the averages for the allocation , the first divisor for each party takes into account the number of constituency seats won by the party ; i.e as in numerous party-list , in order to be eligible for list seats in many mmp models , a party must earn at least a certain percentage of the total party vote , or no candidates will be elected from the party list new zealand adopted the system for its unicameral house of representatives in 1994 following a long electoral reform process , beginning with the royal commission on the electoral system in 1985 and ending with the 1993 referendum on the voting system unlike the other two assemblies that use the system , parties have to pass a threshold of 5 % of the regional votes in order to be eligible for the list seats the amendment increases the number of seats in the council from 152 to 190 ( +38 ) , 80 % of the seats will be filled with first-past-the-post voting and the rest 20 % by proportional voting in 2007 , the citizens ' assembly on electoral reform in ontario , canada , also recommended the use of mmp in future elections to the legislative assembly of ontario , with a ballot similar to new zealand 's , and with the closed province-wide lists used in new zealand but with only 30 % compensatory members in a non-binding plebiscite between 27 october and 7 november 2016 , prince edward islanders voted for mmp over fptp in the final round of counting , 52 % –43 % ; however , the provincial government , despite having set no voter turnout threshold , subsequently claimed that the 36 percent turnout was insufficient to change the electoral system the bill presented by the citizen power now movement and endorsed by the majority of parliamentary groups would create two types of deputies ; 42 elected proportionally by lists presented by the political parties and would be called '' national '' deputies , whilst another 42 deputies would be elected directly by population-based electoral districts on a first pass the post basis parliament 's high level panel report of 2017 , chaired by former president kgalema motlanthe , validated the van zyl slabbert mixed-system and recommended its adoption , stating : '' such a system will serve to limit the power of individual party leaders and encourage mps to vote in accordance with the needs and desires of their constituencies rather than only following party lines '' for example , the german moderate-right free democratic party ( fdp ) has often received votes from voters who preferred the larger christian democratic union ( cdu ) party , because they feared that if the fdp received less than 5 % of the votes , the cdu would have no parliamentary allies and would be unable to form a government on its own in this case the tactic maintained some proportionality by bypassing the 5 % threshold , but is largely disfavoured by the public due to it awarding smaller parties extra list seats while parties with a higher party vote percentage that do n't win an electorate receive no seats ; this occurred in 2008 when act was awarded 5 seats on the back of one electorate seat and 3.7 % of the party vote , while new zealand first with no electorate seats and 4.1 % of the party vote were awarded none in august 2012 , the initial report on a review of the mmp system by the electoral commission recommended abolishing the one electorate seat threshold , meaning a party winning an electorate seat but not crossing the 5 % threshold ( which the same report recommends lowering to 4 % ) is only awarded that electorate seat in other cases , a party may be so certain of winning a large number of constituency seats that it expects no extra seats in the proportional top-up ( list seats ) this tactic is much less effective in mmp models with a relatively large share of list seats ( 50 % in most german states , and 42.5 % in the new zealand house of representatives ) and/or ones which add '' balance seats '' , leading to less opportunities for overhangs and maintaining full proportionality even when a party wins too many constituency seats this tactic was used to such an extent that it totally distorted the working of the model , to the point that the parties that won list seats were almost always different from the parties that won constituency seats in an abusive gambit similar to that used in albania , major parties feeling that they are unlikely to win a large number of list seats because of their advantage at the constituency level might choose to split their party in two , with one subdivision of the party contesting the constituency seats , while the other contests the list seats —assuming this is allowed by electoral law in this case the two leading parties , the lesotho congress for democracy ( lcd ) and the all basotho convention ( abc ) used decoy lists , respectively named the national independent party and the lesotho workers ' party to avoid the compensatory mechanisms of mmp '' in the 2012 election , the voting system was adjusted to link the local and list seats to limit the decoy lists ' effectiveness , resulting in an almost perfectly proportionate election result for the competing parties another interesting case is that of venezuela , which also ended up changing its system , in this case by formally adopting a parallel voting system and legitimizing party efforts to game the mmp approach on september 26 , 2010 , chavez ' party , the united socialist party of venezuela , took 57.4 % of parliamentary seats with only 48.2 % of the vote under the new system ( ignoring the role of small allied parties ) one can see to what extent parallel voting had nonetheless helped to redress the balance towards proportionality somewhat by noting that chavez ' party would have taken an even larger share of assembly seats under a strict single-winner approach ( 71 constituency seats out of 109 , or 65 % ) another example is that of the 2001 italian general election , in which one of the two main coalitions ( the house of freedoms ) , which opposed the scorporo system ( an alternate version of mmp ) , linked many of their constituency candidates to a decoy list ( liste civetta ) in the proportional parts , under the name abolizione scorporo in the case the house of freedoms list faction forza italia , the tactic was so successful that it did not have enough candidates in the proportional part to receive as many seats as it in fact won , missing out on 12 seats ahead of the 2020 south korean legislative election , the electoral system was changed from parallel voting to a hybrid mixed-member proportional system , with 30 seats allocated in a compensatory manner
