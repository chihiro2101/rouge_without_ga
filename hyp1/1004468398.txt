pachelbel 's canon also uses a similar sequence of notes in the bass part : two pieces by j.s.bach are particularly striking for their use of an ostinato bass : the crucifixus from his mass in b minor and the passacaglia in c minor for organ , which has a ground rich in melodic intervals : a performance of the entire piece can be heard here gehard kubik concludes : the harmonic cycle of c–f–g–f i–iv–v–iv prominent in congo/zaire popular music simply can not be defined as a progression from tonic to subdominant to dominant and back to subdominant ( on which it ends ) because in the performer 's appreciation they are of equal status , and not in any hierarchical order as in western music— ( kubik 1999 ) many well known artists primarily build songs with a vamp/riff/ostinato based approach—including john lee hooker ( '' boogie chillen '' , '' house rent boogie '' ) , bo diddley ( '' hey bo diddley '' , '' who do you love ? '' ) , jimmy page ( '' ramble on '' , '' bron yr aur '' ) , nine inch nails ( '' closer '' ) , and beck ( '' loser '' ) the following songs are dominated by vamps : john coltrane , kenny burrell , and grant green 's versions of '' my favorite things '' , herbie hancock 's '' watermelon man '' and '' chameleon '' , wes montgomery 's '' bumpin ' on sunset '' , and larry carlton 's '' room 335 '' that consists of an ostinato shared between viola and cello supporting a melody in octaves in the first and second violins : both the first and third acts of wagner 's final opera parsifal feature a passage accompanying a scene where a band of knights solemnly processes from the depths of forest to the hall of the grail though they are most often found in rock music , heavy metal music , latin , funk and jazz , classical music is also sometimes based on a simple riff , such as ravel 's boléro in the famous english canon '' sumer is icumen in '' , the main vocal lines are underpinned by an ostinato pattern , known as a pes : later in the medieval era , guillaume dufay 's 15th-century chanson resvelons nous features a similarly constructed ostinato pattern , but this time 5 bars long dido 's opening aria '' ah , belinda '' is a further demonstration of purcell 's technical mastery : the phrases of the vocal line do not always coincide with the four-bar ground : '' purcell 's compositions over a ground vary in their working out , and the repetition never becomes a restriction ground bass or basso ostinato ( obstinate bass ) is a type of variation form in which a bass line , or harmonic pattern ( see chaconne ; also common in elizabethan england as grounde ) is repeated as the basis of a piece underneath variations 1970s-era funk music often takes a short one or two bar musical figure based on a single chord one would consider an introduction vamp in jazz or soul music , and then uses this vamp as the basis of the entire song ( '' funky drummer '' by james brown , for example ) the rideout is the transitional music that begins on the downbeat of the last word of the song and is usually two to four bars long , though it may be as short as a sting or as long as a roxy rideout mozart uses an ostinato phrase throughout the big scene that ends act 2 of the marriage of figaro , to convey a sense of suspense as the jealous count almaviva tries in vain to incriminate the countess , his wife , and figaro , his butler , for plotting behind his back classic examples of vamps in jazz include '' a night in tunisia '' , '' take five '' , '' a love supreme '' , '' maiden voyage '' , and '' cantaloupe island '' rikky rooksby states : '' a riff is a short , repeated , memorable musical phrase , often pitched low on the guitar , which focuses much of the energy and excitement of a rock song david brackett ( 1999 ) defines riffs as '' short melodic phrases '' , while richard middleton ( 1999 ) defines them as '' short rhythmic , melodic , or harmonic figures repeated to form a structural framework '' '' take five '' begins with a repeated , syncopated figure in time , which pianist dave brubeck plays throughout the song ( except for joe morello 's drum solo and a variation on the chords in the middle section ) harmonic progressions which move from the tonic to the subdominant ( as they are known in european music ) have been used in traditional sub-saharan african harmony for hundreds of years '' in funk , harmony is often second to the 'lock , ' the linking of contrapuntal parts that are played on guitar , bass , and drums in the repeating vamp the term frequently appeared in the instruction 'vamp till ready ' on sheet music for popular songs in the 1930s and 1940s , indicating the accompanist should repeat the musical phrase until the vocalist was ready his most famous ostinato is the descending chromatic ground bass that underpins the aria '' when i am laid in earth '' ( '' dido 's lament '' ) at the end of his opera dido and aeneas : the equivalent in classical music is an ostinato , in hip hop and electronic music the loop , and in rock music the riff jazz , blues , and rock are almost always based on chord progressions ( a sequence of changing chords ) , and they use the changing harmony to build tension and sustain listener interest traditional sub-saharan african harmony canto ostinato chaconne chanking fill ( music ) folia glossary of musical terminology hook ( music ) imitation ( music ) leitmotif music sequencer o fortuna passacaglia pedal point sequence ( music ) '' here a rigid pattern of ( 3+2+2/4 ) bars is laid over a strictly recurring twenty-three-beat tune ( the bars being marked by a cello ostinato ) , so that their changing relationship is governed primarily by the pre-compositional scheme depending upon the musician , a repeating figure in '' a night in tunisia '' could be called an ostinato , guajeo , riff , or vamp in musical theater , a vamp , or intro , is the few bars , one to eight , of music without lyrics that begin a printed copy of a song a vamp at the beginning of a jazz tune may act as a springboard to the main tune ; a vamp at the end of a song is often called a tag this melodic pattern is set to the number of beats in a rhythmic cycle ( tala or taal ) being performed and may be based on one or a blend of multiple ragas it is essential that the lehara be played with the highest precision in laya ( tempo ) and swara control , which requires years of specialist training ( taalim ) and practice ( riyaaz ) the playing of the lehara is relatively free from the numerous rules and constraints of raga sangeet , which are upheld and honoured in the tradition of indian classical music the guajeo is a seamless afro-euro ostinato hybrid , which has had a major influence upon jazz , r & b , rock ' n ' roll and popular music in general riffs can be as simple as a tenor saxophone honking a simple , catchy rhythmic figure , or as complex as the riff-based variations in the head arrangements played by the count basie orchestra 'roopak ' or 'rupak ' taal , a 7-beat rhythmic cycle , is divided 3–2–2 , further implying that the 1st , 4th , and 6th beats are the prominent beats in that taal in indian classical music , during tabla or pakhawaj solo performances and kathak dance accompaniments , a conceptually similar melodic pattern known as the lehara ( sometimes spelled lehra ) or nagma is played repeatedly throughout the performance examples include the outros to george benson 's '' body talk '' and '' plum '' , and the solo changes to '' breezin ' '' a famous type of ostinato , called the rossini crescendo , owes its name to a crescendo that underlies a persistent musical pattern , which usually culminates in a solo vocal cadenza a famous type of ostinato , called the rossini crescendo , owes its name to a crescendo that underlies a persistent musical pattern , which usually culminates in a solo vocal cadenza over this , the main melodic line moves freely , varying the phrase-lengths , while being '' to some extent predetermined by the repeating pattern of the canon in the lower two voices a particularly fine and complex example is his fantasia upon a ground for three violins and continuo : the intervals in the above pattern are found in many works of the baroque period
