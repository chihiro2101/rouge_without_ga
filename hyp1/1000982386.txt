in this he contends that only the epistle to the galatians , first and second epistle to the corinthians and epistle to the romans are genuinely pauline , and that the paul of the acts of the apostles is a different person from the paul of these genuine epistles , the author being a paulinist who , with an eye to the different parties in the church , is at pains to represent peter as far as possible as a paulinist and paul as far as possible as a petrinist it was assumed that this 4th century opinion represented the christianity of the twelve apostles ; paulinism was originally a heresy , and a schism from the jewish christianity of james and peter and the rest ; marcion was a leader of the pauline sect in its survival in the 2nd century , using only the pauline gospel , st '' the change of view is illustrated clearly in the essay , published in the tübinger zeitschrift for 1831 , on the christ-party in the apollos , die christuspartei in der korinthischen gemeinde , der gegensatz des paulinischen und petrinischen christentums in der ältesten kirche , der apostel petrus in rom , the trend of which is suggested by the title ( in english , 'the christ party in the corinthian community , the opposition of pauline and petrine christianity in the earliest church , the apostle peter in rome ' ) when , a few years after his appointment at blaubeuren , he published his first important work , symbolik und mythologie oder die naturreligion des altertums ( '' symbol and mythology : the natural religion of antiquity '' , 1824–1825 ) , it became evident that he had made a deeper study of philosophy , and had come under the influence of schelling and more particularly of friedrich schleiermacher the value of these works is impaired somewhat by baur 's habit of making the history of dogma conform to the formulae of hegel 's philosophy , a procedure '' which only served to obscure the truth and profundity of his conception of history as a true development of the human mind '' ( pfleiderer ) here he studied for a time under ernst bengel , grandson of the eminent new testament critic , johann albrecht bengel , and at this early stage in his career he seems to have been under the influence of the old tübingen school in this baur attempts to prove that the false teachers mentioned in the second epistle to timothy and epistle to titus are the gnostics , particularly the marcionites , of the 2nd century , and consequently that the pastoral epistles were produced in the middle of the 2nd century in opposition to gnosticism das manichäische religionssystem ( '' the manichaean religious system '' ) appeared in 1831 , apollonius of tyana in 1832 , die christliche gnosis ( '' christian gnosis '' ) in 1835 , and über das christliche im platonismus oder socrates und christus ( '' on christianity in platonism : socrates and christ '' ) in 1837 in his kritische untersuchungen über die kanonischen evangelien , ihr verhältniss zu einander , ihren charakter und ursprung ( 1847 ) he turns his attention to the gospels , and here again finds that the authors were conscious of the conflict of parties ; the gospels reveal a mediating or conciliatory tendency ( tendenz ) on the part of the writers or redactors paul , the apostle of jesus christ , his life and work , his epistles and his doctrine translated by eduard zeller church history of the first three centuries vol 1 1878 english translation church history of the first three centuries vol 2 english a philological introduction to greek and latin for students translated by paul kegen 1879 f.c the fourth gospel is a monument of this reconciliation , in which rome took a leading part , having invented the fiction that both peter and paul were the founders of her church , both having been martyred at rome , and on the same day , in perfect union 2nd century : sixtus senensis ( sixtus of siena ) ( 1520-1569 ) , david blondel ( david blondellus catalaunensis ) ( 1590-1655 ) , jean-baptiste cotelier ( 1629-1686 ) , william cave ( 1637-1713 ) , casimir oudin ( 1638-1717 ) , noël alexandre ( natalis alexander ) ( 1639-1724 ) , denis-nicolas le nourry ( nourri ) ( 1647-1724 ) , johann georg heinsius ( d 1733 ) , ernst friedrich karl rosenmüller ( 1768-1835 ) , christian wilhelm flügge ( 1773-1828 ) , karl gottlieb bretschneider ( 1776-1848 ) , johann georg veit engelhardt ( 1791-1855 ) , johann karl ludwig gieseler ( 1792-1854 ) , friedrich august gottreu tholuck ( 1799-1877 ) , and august friedrich gfrörer ( 1803-1861 ) the kirchengeschichte was published in five volumes during the years 1853-1863 , partly by baur himself , partly by his son , ferdinand baur , and his son-in-law , eduard zeller , from notes and lectures which the author left behind him thus there was some antagonism between the jewish apostles peter , james and john , and paul the '' apostle to the gentiles '' , and this struggle continued down to the middle of the 2nd century the petrine matthew bears the closest relationship to this original gospel ( urevangelium ) ; the pauline luke is later and arose independently ; mark represents a still later development according to baur ; the account in john is idealistic : it '' does not possess historical truth , and can not and does not really lay claim to it the change is noticeable in his epochen der kirchlichen geschichtschreibung ( 1852 ) , das christenthum und die christiche kirche der drei ersten jahrhunderte ( 1853 ) , and die christliche kirche von anfang des vierten bis zum ende das sechsten jahrhunderts ( 1859 ) , works preparatory to his kirchengeschichte , in which the change of view is specially pronounced catholicism under the presidency of rome was the result of the adjustment between the petrine and pauline sections of the church in the second half of the 2nd century paul and the apocalypse were the only documents generally admitted as being of early date ) , and the proofs of the authenticity of the apostolic fathers and of the use of st
