in 1878 kapteyn was inducted as the first professor of astronomy and theoretical mechanics at the university of groningen it was later realized that kapteyn 's data had been the first evidence of the rotation of our galaxy , which ultimately led to the finding of galactic rotation by bertil lindblad and jan oort in 1906 , kapteyn launched a plan for a major study of the distribution of stars in the galaxy , using counts of stars in different directions kapteyn later retired in 1921 at the age of seventy , but on the request of his former student and director of leiden observatory willem de sitter , kapteyn went back to leiden to assist in upgrading the observatory to contemporary astronomical standards ultimately , von seegler was able to determine the rates at which the galaxy was diminishing in multiple different areas of the sky in 1901 , kapteyn employed the proper motions technique and derived a statistical approach that allowed him to estimate the average distance to stars between successive magnitudes , effectively providing a scale for von seegler 's discoveries conclusive results from von seegler and kapteyn estimated the galaxy to be an oblate star system approximately 10 kpc in width and 2 kpc in thickness , the sun being relatively close ( 0.6 kpc ) to the center using the method of star counts , kapteyn was able to confirm his results and dubbed his findings as his first model of the galaxy kapteyn had presented his findings in his life 's work , first attempt at a theory of the arrangement and motion of the sidereal system , which was published in 1922 it was determined that his model of the galaxy was valid at high galactic latitudes but failed in the galactic plane because of the lack of knowledge on interstellar absorption this discovery estimated the size of the galaxy to be about 2.5 times larger than initially was thought , with the sun replaced to a distance of 9.2 kpc from the galactic center awards gold medal of the royal astronomical society ( 1902 ) james craig watson medal ( 1913 ) bruce medal ( 1913 ) named after him kapteyn ( crater ) on the moon asteroid 818 kapteynia kapteyn 's star kapteyn astronomical institute at the university of groningen jacobus kapteyn telescope ( jkt ) at la palma , one of the canary islands kapteyn package , astronomical package for python
