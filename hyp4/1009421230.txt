the term '' late capitalism '' was first used by werner sombart in his magnum opus der moderne kapitalismus , which was published from 1902 through 1927 , and subsequent writings ; sombart divided capitalism into different stages : ( 1 ) proto-capitalist society from the early middle ages up to 1500 ad , ( 2 ) early capitalism in 1500–1800 , ( 3 ) the heyday of capitalism ( hochkapitalismus ) from 1800 to the first world war , and ( 4 ) late capitalism since then sombart 's work was never translated into english , but historians sometimes do refer to late bourgeois society in contrast to early bourgeois society in the 17th and 18th century , or classical bourgeois society in the 19th and early 20th century the communist international stated that with the first world war , a new world epoch of wars and revolutions had opened , and it defined state monopoly capitalism as the highest and final stage of capitalism the term late capitalism began to be used by socialists in continental europe towards the end of the 1930s and in the 1940s , when many economists believed capitalism was doomed at the end of world war ii , many economists , including joseph schumpeter and paul samuelson , believed the end of capitalism could be near , in that the economic problems might be insurmountable the '' end of history '' is discussed by francis fukuyama in the sense that liberal democracy is the ultimate form of society , which can not be surpassed by anything that is superior to it , because there does not and can not exist anything superior in modern usage , late capitalism often refers to a new mix of high-tech advances , the concentration of ( speculative ) financial capital , post-fordism , and a growing income inequality 387 up to the mid-1960s , mandel preferred to use the term '' neo-capitalism '' , which was most often used by intellectuals in belgium and france around that time this term drew attention to new characterististics of capitalism , but at the time ultra-leftist marxists objected to it , because , according to them , it might suggest that capitalism was no longer capitalism , and it might lead to reformist errors rather than the overthrow of capitalism the epoch of late capitalism emerging out of the second world war , which has as its dominant features the multinational corporation , globalization , consumerism , and the space of liquid multinational capital flows 165–166 in the tradition of the orthodox marxists , mandel tried to characterize the nature of the modern epoch as a whole , with reference to the main laws of motion of capitalism specified by marx 216–217 mandel 's aim was to explain the unexpected revival of capitalism after world war ii , contrary to leftist prognostications , and the long economic boom which showed the fastest economic growth ever seen in human history in the modernist era , the dominant ideology was that society could be re-engineered on the basis of scientific and technical knowledge , and on the basis of a popular consensus about the meaning of progress from the second half of the 20th century , however , modernism was gradually eclipsed by postmodernism , which is skeptical about social engineering and features a lack of consensus about the meaning of progress 163 according to a 2017 article in the atlantic , the term '' late capitalism '' is again in vogue to describe modern business culture , although with a semantic change or an ironic twist '' late capitalism '' has become a catch-all term for various phenomena that express capitalism 's distortions of human life , and it is often used in critique and satire
