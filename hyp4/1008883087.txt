a 2020 study mentioned that expedition 364 drilled to a depth of below the sea floor to reach the peak ring , and discovered a massive hydrothermal system filled with magma , which modified ~1.4 × 10 5 km 3 of earth 's crust and lasted for hundreds of thousands of years ; in addition , those hydrothermal system might support the impact origin of life hypothesis for the hadean , when the entire surface of earth was affected by impactors enormously larger than the chicxulub impactor . in 2013 a study compared isotopes in impact glass from the chicxulub impact with the same isotopes in ash from the boundary where the extinction event occurred in the fossil record ; the study concluded that the impact glasses were dated at 66.038 ± 0.049 ma , and the deposits immediately above the discontinuity in the geological and fossil record was dated to 66.019 ± 0.021 ma , the two dates being within 19,000 years of each other , or almost exactly the same within experimental error it had been subjected to immense pressures and forces and had been melted by heat and shocked by pressure from its usual state into its present form in just minutes ; the fact that the peak ring was made of granite was also significant , since granite is not a rock found in sea-floor deposits , originating much deeper in the earth , and had been ejected to the surface by the immense pressures of impact '' evidence correlating this find to the chicxulub impact included tektites bearing '' the unique chemical signature of other tektites associated with the chicxulub event '' found in the gills of fish fossils and embedded in amber , an iridium-rich top layer that is considered another signature of the event , and an atypical lack of scavenging of the dead fish and animals that suggested few other species survived the event to feed off the mass death '' this was borne out by the results of a drilling project in 2016 which found that sulfate-containing rocks found in the area were not found in the peak ring ( the rocks found were from deep within the earth 's crust instead ) , the interpretation being that they had been vaporized by the impact and dispersed into the atmosphere the chicxulub crater lends support to the theory postulated by the late physicist luis alvarez and his son , geologist walter alvarez , that the extinction of numerous animal and plant groups , including non-avian dinosaurs , may have resulted from a bolide impact ( the cretaceous–paleogene extinction event ) lunar and planetary science xlviii ( 2017 ) a program on british television in 2017 the day the dinosaurs died , bbc2 television , july 1 , 2017 , 6 to 7 pm described that the drilling revealed , from top down : thick cenozoic limestone , about ; a graded sediment deposit from the megatsunami , over thick ; the impact melted basement granite from the earth 's midcrust with shocked quartz gypsum , a sulfate-containing rock usually present in the shallow seabed of the region , had been almost entirely removed and likely vaporized to enter the atmosphere , an event immediately followed by a megatsunami sufficient to lay down the largest-known layered bed of sand , around deep and separated by grain size , directly above the peak ring taken together , analyses indicate that the impactor was large enough to create a peak ring , to melt , shock and eject granite from many kilometers within the earth , to create colossal water movements , and to eject an immense quantity of vaporized rock and sulfates into the atmosphere , where they would have persisted over years to decades a team of california researchers including kevin pope , adriana ocampo , and charles duller , surveying regional satellite images in 1996 , found a cenote ( sinkhole ) ring centered on chicxulub that matched the one penfield saw earlier ; the cenotes were thought to be caused by subsidence of bolide-weakened lithostratigraphy around the impact crater wall luis and walter alvarez , at the time both faculty members at the university of california , berkeley , postulated that this enormous extinction event , which was roughly contemporaneous with the postulated date of formation for the chicxulub crater , could have been caused by just such a large impact in a march 2019 article in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences , an international team of twelve scientists revealed the contents of the tanis fossil site discovered near bowman , north dakota that appeared to show the destruction of an ancient lake and its inhabitants at the time of the chicxulub impact in february 2021 , scientists reported studies suggesting the impactor that led to the demise of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago was a fragment from a disrupted comet , rather than an asteroid which has long been the leading candidate among scientists the peak ring itself did not contain the calcium sulfate that the rocks in the area around contain , leading the program makers to conclude that all the calcium sulfate in the crater area had been vaporized into the atmosphere and had become a dense sulfur dioxide veil stopping the sunlight in 1978 , geophysicists glen penfield and antonio camargo were working for the mexican state-owned oil company pemex , or pemex , as part of an airborne magnetic survey of the gulf of mexico north of the yucatán peninsula the age of the rocks marked by the impact shows that this impact structure dates from roughly 66 million years ago , the end of the cretaceous period , and the start of the paleogene period bottke , david vokrouhlický , and david nesvorný , argued that a collision in the asteroid belt 160 million years ago resulted in the baptistina family of asteroids , the largest surviving member of which is 298 baptistina it was hypothesized that the iridium was spread into the atmosphere when the impactor was vaporized and settled across the earth 's surface among other material thrown up by the impact , producing the layer of iridium-enriched clay according to the press release , that '' could have made the impact deadlier in two ways : by altering climate ( sulfate aerosols in the upper atmosphere can have a cooling effect ) and by generating acid rain ( water vapor can help to flush the lower atmosphere of sulfate aerosols , causing acid rain ) for comparison , this is ~100 & nbsp ; million times the energy released by the tsar bomba , a thermonuclear weapon ( '' h-bomb '' ) that remains the most powerful human-made explosive ever detonated , which released 210 & nbsp ; petajoules ( 2.1×10 & nbsp ; joules , or 50 & nbsp ; megatons tnt ) this makes an asteroid from this family highly improbable to be the asteroid that created the chicxulub crater , as typically the process of resonance and collision of an asteroid takes many tens of millions of years the connection between chicxulub and baptistina is supported by the large amount of carbonaceous material present in microscopic fragments of the impactor , suggesting the impactor was a member of an uncommon class of asteroids called carbonaceous chondrites , like baptistina 2 pencil mapping of the offshore magnetic anomalies , the fit was perfect : a shallow , 180-kilometer diameter gravity-magnetic bullseye on the almost non-magnetic , uniform carbonate background of the yucatan platform ! we recognized the crater as the likely cretaceous-paleogene boundary event the main evidence of such an impact , besides the crater itself , is contained in a thin layer of clay present in the k–pg boundary across the world along the edge of the crater are clusters of cenotes or sinkholes , which suggest that there was a water basin inside the feature during the neogene period , after the impact this layer could have resulted from the intense heat and pressure of an earth impact , but at the time of the borings it was dismissed as a lava dome—a feature uncharacteristic of the region 's geology at the same time , in 1980 , geologist walter alvarez and his father , nobel prize–winning scientist luis walter alvarez , put forth their hypothesis that a large extraterrestrial body had struck earth at the time of the cretaceous–paleogene boundary the impact associated with the crater is thus implicated in the cretaceous–paleogene extinction event , including the worldwide extinction of non-avian dinosaurs as additional clues of the resulting megatsunami found in a new jersey , us quarry , a dense marine bone bed was found on the cretaceous–paleogene boundary containing a mixture of dead sea animals with little or no damage from scavengers or predators the findings confirmed that the rock comprising the peak ring had originated deep in the earth , and was ejected to the surface excavated material along with pieces of the impactor , ejected out of the atmosphere by the blast , would have been heated to incandescence upon re-entry , broiling the earth 's surface and possibly igniting wildfires ; meanwhile , colossal shock waves would have triggered global earthquakes and volcanic eruptions in 2010 , another hypothesis was offered which implicated the newly discovered asteroid 354p/linear , a member of the flora family of asteroids , as a possible remnant cohort of the k/pg impactor the chicxulub impactor had an estimated diameter of , and delivered an estimated energy of 21–921 & nbsp ; billion hiroshima a-bombs ( between 1.3×10 and 5.8×10 & nbsp ; joules , or 1.3–58 & nbsp ; yotta- ) '' fossil evidence for an instantaneous die-off of diverse animals was found in a soil layer only thick in new jersey away from the impact site , indicating that death and burial under debris occurred suddenly and quickly over wide distances on land
