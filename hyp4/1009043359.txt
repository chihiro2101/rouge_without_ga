its name had been taken from an older common brittonic place-name , cantium ( '' corner of land '' or '' land on the edge '' ) used in the preceding pre-roman iron age , although the extent of this tribal area is unknown as the closest part of britain to mainland europe , it is likely that kent would have experienced many attacks from seafaring raiders , resulting in the construction of four saxon shore along the kentish coast : regulbium , rutupiae , dubris , and portus lemanis it is also likely that germanic-speaking mercenaries from northern gaul , known as foederati , would have been hired to supplement official roman troops during this period , with land in kent as payment according to the anglo-saxon chronicle , produced in late anglo-saxon england and not considered an accurate record of events in the fifth century , in 418 many romans left britain via kent , taking much of their wealth with them there has been much debate as to the scale of this migration ; some see it as a mass migration in which large numbers of germanic peoples left northern europe to settle in britain , pushing the native british population to western britain or brittany ; others have argued that only a small warrior elite came over , dominating ( or even enslaving ) the romano-british population , who then began using the old english language and material culture of the newcomers 24 however , some of the romano-british population likely remained , as the roman name for the area , cantiaca , influenced the name of the new anglo-saxon kingdom , the cantware ( '' dwellers of kent '' ) the germanic migration to britain is noted in textual sources from the late anglo-saxon period , most notably bede 's ecclesiastical history of the english people and the anglo-saxon chronicle ; both rely on oral history from the fifth century , and were attempts to establish origin myths that would justify the politics of the time according to the anglo-saxon chronicle , a '' king of the britons '' known as vortigern invited two germanic leaders , hengist and horsa ( '' stallion '' and '' horse '' ) , to britain to help defend against pictish raiders among these were the old saxons , the angles , and the jutes ; the latter settled in kent and the isle of wight , establishing the peoples known as the cantware and wihtwara a similar account is provided in bede 's ecclesiastical history : that the people of kent and isle of wight were descended from jutish settlers , and that horsa was killed in battle against the britons , adding that his body was buried in east kent the anglo-saxons made use of pre-existing prehistoric and roman road systems , with 85 % of cemeteries being located within 1.2 & nbsp ; km of a roman road , a navigable river or the coast , and the remaining 15 % being close to ancient trackways there is also archaeological evidence of kentish trade links in hampshire and the isle of wight , and copies or imitations appearing in cemeteries further afield , in areas such as wiltshire and cambridgeshire to the south lay the weald , a dense forest of no value to the kentish elite , leaving the fertile area west of the kingdom attractive for conquest , particularly the river darenth and the dip slopes of the north downs to the west of the medway the anglo-saxon chronicle refers to wars in sixth-century britain , but most were in the west and did not affect kent ; the one exception was a battle between the kentish and west saxons in 568 , during which æthelberht 's forces were pushed back into kent according to bede , the christianization of anglo-saxon england began in kent under æthelberht 's reign when the benedictine monk augustine arrived on the ebbsfleet peninsula in 597 , bringing the gregorian mission with him various seventh and eighth century documents attest to the fact that kent was governed by two kings , a dominant one in the east and a subordinate in the west , likely reflecting the earlier divide in the seventh century , kent 's power waned as that of mercia and northumbria grew , but it remained the fourth wealthiest kingdom in england , according to the tribal hidage with 15,000 hides of land recorded in the seventh or eighth century however the period was tumultuous for the kentish royal family ; kent was ruled by ecgberht from 664 to 673 , but between 664 and 667 two royal cousins , æthelred and æthelberht , were killed at eastry royal hall , perhaps because they were a threat to ecgberht mercia 's control of kent increased in the following decades ; by 689–690 east saxon kings under mercian overlordship were active in west kent , and there are records attesting that æthelred arbitrated on the income of the christian communities at minster-in-thanet and reculver , indicating strong mercian control over the east of the kingdom too in 686 kent was conquered by cædwalla of wessex ; within a year , cædwalla 's brother mul was killed in a kentish revolt , and cædwalla returned to devastate the kingdom again wihtred , famous for the law of wihtred , did a great deal to restore the kingdom after the devastation and tumult of the preceding years , and in 694 he made peace with the wessex by paying compensation for the killing of mul the earliest churches in the region have been termed the '' kentish group '' and reflect both italian and frankish influences in their design ; early examples include st pancras , st mary , and st peter and st paul , all part of st augustine 's abbey in canterbury , as well as st during the eighth and ninth centuries , a number of fortified earthworks , most notably wansdyke and offa 's dyke , were constructed as barriers between the warring kingdoms ; the faestendic passing through the river cray and the routeway that has since become the a25 were likely kentish earthworks of this period designed to protect the kingdom further recorded attacks occurred on sheppey in 835 , through romney marsh in 841 , in rochester in 842 , canterbury ( battle of aclea ) and sandwich ( battle of sandwich ) in 851 , thanet in 853 , and across kent in 865 at this point , canterbury and rochester still had roman walls that could have been refurbished , but they were nevertheless attacked by the vikings : rochester in 842 , canterbury in 851 , and rochester again in 885 , when they laid siege until it was liberated by alfred 's army
