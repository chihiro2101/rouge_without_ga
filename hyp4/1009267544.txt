at the advent of laser cooling techniques , maxwell 's theory of electromagnetism had already led to the quantification of electromagnetic radiation exerting a force ( radiation pressure ) , however it was n't until the turn of the twentieth century when studies by lebedev ( 1901 ) , nichols ( 1901 ) , and hull ( 1903 ) experimentally demonstrated that force doppler cooling , which is usually accompanied by a magnetic trapping force to give a magneto-optical trap , is by far the most common method of laser cooling if the atom , which is now in the excited state , then emits a photon spontaneously , it will be kicked by the same amount of momentum , but in a random direction the major breakthroughs in the 70s and 80s in the use of laser light for cooling led to several improvements to preexisting technology and new discoveries with temperatures just above absolute zero , not pure gain ) , the overall result of the absorption and emission process is to reduce the momentum of the atom , therefore its speed & mdash ; provided its initial speed was larger than the recoil speed from scattering a single photon in 2011 , a team from the california institute of technology and the university of vienna became the first to laser-cool a ( 10 μm x 1 μm ) mechanical object to its quantum ground state , & nbsp ; at lower frequency ) of the transition , the atoms will absorb more photons if they move towards the light source , due to the doppler effect since the temperature of a group of atoms is a measure of the average random internal kinetic energy , this is equivalent to cooling the atoms the cooling processes were utilized to make atomic clocks more accurate and to improve spectroscopic measurements , and led to the observation of a new state of matter at ultracold temperatures in doppler cooling , initially , the frequency of light is tuned slightly below an electronic transition in the atom
