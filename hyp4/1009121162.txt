the product of such hydrography is most often seen on nautical charts published by the national agencies and required by the international maritime organization ( imo ) , imo the safety of life at sea ( solas ) solas chapter v safety of navigation and national regulations to be carried on vessels for safety purposes such surveys commonly are conducted by national organizations or under their supervision or the standards they have approved , particularly when the use is for the purposes of chart making and distribution or the dredging of state-controlled waters commercial entities also conduct large-scale hydrographic and geophysics surveying , particularly in the dredging , marine construction , oil exploration , and drilling industries here , volunteer vessels record position , depth , and time data using their standard navigation instruments , and then the data is post-processed to account for speed of sound , tidal , and other corrections with this approach there is no need for a specific survey vessel , or for professionally qualified surveyors to be on board , as the expertise is in the data processing that occurs once the data is uploaded to the server after the voyage for many centuries , a hydrographic survey required the use of lead lines – ropes or lines with depth markings attached to lead weights to make one end sink to the bottom when lowered over the side of a ship or boat – and sounding poles , which were poles with depth markings which could be thrust over the side until they touched bottom the process was labor-intensive and time-consuming and , although each individual depth measurement could be accurate , even a thorough survey as a practical matter could include only a limited number of sounding measurements relative to the area being surveyed , inevitably leaving gaps in coverage between single soundings this greatly increased the speed of acquiring sounding data over that possible with lead lines and sounding poles by allowing information on depths beneath a vessel to be gathered in a series of lines spaced at a specified distance the location of the '' v '' revealed the position of submerged rocks , wrecks , and other obstructions , while the depth at which the wire was set showed the depth at which the obstruction was encountered coast and geodetic survey , and later the national oceanic and atmospheric administration , fielded a pair of sister ships of identical design specifically to work together on such surveys 1.3 of contract specifications for hydrographic surveys , land information new zealand in a set of contract survey requirements , is a clear indication that the wider hydrographic community is embracing the benefits that can be accrued by employing mbes technology and , in particular , are accepting as a fact that a mbes which provides acoustic backscatter data is a valuable tool of the trade , ( 2019 ) , multispectral acoustic backscatter : how useful is it for marine habitat mapping and management ? , journal of coastal research , 35 ( 5 ) , pp 1062-1079 continues the trajectory of technological innovations providing the hydrographic surveying community with better tools for more rapidly acquiring better data for multiple uses a multispectral multibeam echosounder is the culmination of many progressive advances in hydrography from the early days of acoustic soundings when the primary concern about the strength of returning echoes from the bottom was whether , or not , they would be sufficiently large to be noted ( detected ) eventually it became apparent , that while the operating frequency of the early single vertical beam acoustic sounders had little , or no , bearing on the measured depths when the bottom was hard ( comprised primarily of sand , pebbles , cobbles , boulders , or rock ) , there was a noticeable frequency dependency of the measured depths when the bottom was soft ( comprised primarily of silt , mud or flocculent suspensions ) in the late 1960 's , single beam hydrographic surveys were conducted using widely spaced track lines and the shallow ( peak ) soundings in the bottom data were retained in preference to deeper soundings in the sounding record in fact , important information was deduced about the shape of the bottom and manmade items on the bottom , based on the regions where there were absences of detectable echo amplitudes ( shadows ) fish , j in 1979 , in hopes of a technological solution to the problems of surveying in '' floating mud '' , the director of the national ocean survey ( nos ) established a nos study team to conduct investigations to determine the functional specifications for a replacement shallow water depth sounder ( 1981 ) , a study of future depth recorder requirements , international hydrographic review , lviii ( 2 ) the outcome of the study was a class of vertical-beam depth sounders , which is still widely used , ( 2010 ) , an introduction into underwater acoustics : principles and applications , 2nd ed , isbn-13 : 978-3540784807 , springer subsequent to the early mbes bathymetric surveys and at the time when single frequency side scan sonar had begun to produce high quality images of the seabed that were capable of providing a degree of discrimination between different types of sediments , the potential of the echo amplitudes from a mbes was recognized given that side scan sonar , with its across-track fan-shaped swath of insonification , had successfully exploited the cross-track variation in echo amplitudes , to achieve high quality images of the seabed , it seemed a natural progression that the fan-shaped across-track pattern of insonification associated with the new monotone higher frequency shallow water mbes , might also be exploited for seabed imagery side scan sonar parses the continual echo returns from a receive beam that is perfectly aligned with the insonification beam using time-after-transmit , a technique that is independent of water depth and the cross-track beam opening angle of the sonar receive transducer each of the echo amplitude measurements made within a snippet from a particular beam was assigned a geographical position based on linear interpolation between positions assigned to the soundings measured , on that ping , in the two adjacent cross-track beams the snippet modification to mbes imagery significantly improved the quality of the imagery by increasing the number of echo amplitude measurements available to be rendered as a pixel in the image and also by having a more uniform spatial distribution of the pixels in the image which represented an actual measured echo amplitude at one time different data collection methods and standards were used in collecting hydrographic data for maritime safety and for scientific or engineering bathymetric charts , but increasingly , with the aid of improved collection techniques and computer processing , the data is collected under one standard and extracted for specific use
