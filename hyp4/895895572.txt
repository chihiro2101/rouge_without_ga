tax law professor boris bittker and his co-authors have stated : as construed by the supreme court in the brushaber case , the power of congress to tax income derives from article i , section 8 , clause 1 , of the original constitution rather than from the sixteenth amendment ; the latter simply eliminated the requirement ( article i , section 9 , clause 4 of the us constitution ) that an income tax , to the extent that it is a direct tax , must be apportioned among the states in an 8â€“0 decision ( justice james clark mcreynolds did not participate in the decision ) , the court held , in an opinion written by chief justice edward douglass white , that the sixteenth amendment removes the requirement that income taxes be apportioned among the states according to population ( article i , section 9 , clause 4 of the u.s the sixteenth amendment removed the need imposed by the pollock decision to determine whether an income tax in any particular case was required to be apportioned , as the congress could again ( after 1913 ) tax income from any source without having to apportion the tax according to population if a particular income tax was a direct tax or was treated as a direct tax in the constitutional sense , that tax could be imposed ( after pollock but before the passage of the amendment ) only by apportionment among the states , according to their census populations since the income tax may be imposed on income from whatever source and without regard to any apportionment requirement ( by virtue of the wording of the 16th amendment ) , an income tax can not be treated as a direct tax ( as income taxes on income from property were so treated in the pollock case ) the revenue act of 1913 , imposing income taxes that are not apportioned among the states according to each state 's population , is constitutional , however , the court had overturned longstanding precedent and ruled that while a tax on income from labor was an excise , or indirect tax ( which was not required to be apportioned ) , a tax on income derived from property such as interest , dividends , or rents was or should be treated as a direct tax prior to 1895 , all income taxes had been considered indirect taxes ( not required to be apportioned among the states according to the population of each state ) the court further held that the revenue act does not violate the uniformity clause of article i , section 8 of the u.s there can be no dispute that there was power by virtue of the amendment during that period to levy the tax , without apportionment , and so far as the limitations of the constitution in other respects are concerned , the contention is not open moreover , in addition , the conclusion reached in the pollock case did not in any degree involve holding that income taxes generically and necessarily came within the class of direct taxes on property , but , on the contrary , recognized the fact that taxation on income was in its nature an excise the court stated that incomes taxes are indirect excise taxes by reinforcing the pollock decision : as this conclusion but enforced a regulation as to the mode of exercising power under particular circumstances , it did not in any way dispute the all-embracing taxing authority possessed by congress , including necessarily therein the power to impose income taxes if only they conformed to the constitutional regulations which were applicable to them congress had enacted legislation pursuant to the amendment assessing taxes to the wealthiest of income earners , including the railroad company in this case
