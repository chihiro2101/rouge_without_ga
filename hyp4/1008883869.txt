talleyrand , who was a friend of the family and successor of charles delacroix as minister of foreign affairs , and whom the adult eugène resembled in appearance and character , considered himself as his real father throughout his career as a painter , he was protected by talleyrand , who served successively the restoration and king louis-philippe , and ultimately as ambassador of france in great britain , and later by charles de morny , duke of morny , half-brother of napoleon iii and speaker of the french house of commons it precedes the influence of the more colourful and rich style of the flemish baroque painter peter paul rubens , and fellow french artist théodore géricault , whose works marked an introduction to romanticism in art the impact of géricault 's the raft of the medusa was profound , and stimulated delacroix to produce his first major painting , the barque of dante , which was accepted by the paris salon in 1822 the work caused a sensation , and was largely derided by the public and officialdom , yet was purchased by the state for the musée du luxembourg ; the pattern of widespread opposition to his work , countered by a vigorous , enlightened support , would continue throughout his life image : eugène ferdinand victor delacroix 017.jpg left thumb upright greece on the ruins of missolonghi ( 1826 ) , musée des beaux-arts , bordeaux delacroix produced a second painting in support of the greeks in their war for independence , this time referring to the capture of missolonghi by turkish forces in 1825 with a restraint of palette appropriate to the allegory , greece expiring on the ruins of missolonghi displays a woman in greek costume with her breast bared , arms half-raised in an imploring gesture before the horrible scene : the suicide of the greeks , who chose to kill themselves and destroy their city rather than surrender to the turks it also borrowed from a literary source , this time scott , and depicts a scene from the middle ages , that of the murder of louis de bourbon , bishop of liège amidst an orgy sponsored by his captor , william de la marck in 1855 , a critic described the painting 's vibrant handling as '' less finished than a painting , more finished than a sketch , the murder of the bishop of liège was left by the painter at that supreme moment when one more stroke of the brush would have ruined everything '' image : eugène delacroix - la liberté guidant le peuple.jpg thumb liberty leading the people ( 1830 ) , louvre , paris delacroix 's most influential work came in 1830 with the painting liberty leading the people , which for choice of subject and technique highlights the differences between the romantic approach and the neoclassical style delacroix felt his composition more vividly as a whole , thought of his figures and crowds as types , and dominated them by the symbolic figure of republican liberty which is one of his finest plastic inventions although delacroix was inspired by contemporary events to invoke this romantic image of the spirit of liberty , he seems to be trying to convey the will and character of the people , rather than glorifying the actual event , july revolution against charles x , which did little other than bring a different king , louis-philippe , to power following the revolution of 1848 that saw the end of the reign of king louis philippe , delacroix ' painting , liberty leading the people , was finally put on display by the newly elected president , louis napoleon ( napoleon iii ) he eventually produced over 100 paintings and drawings of scenes from or based on the life of the people of north africa , and added a new and personal chapter to the interest in orientalism he believed that the north africans , in their attire and their attitudes , provided a visual equivalent to the people of classical rome and greece : the greeks and romans are here at my door , in the arabs who wrap themselves in a white blanket and look like cato or brutus '' eugène delacroix was a curious mixture of skepticism , politeness , dandyism , willpower , cleverness , despotism , and finally , a kind of special goodness and tenderness that always accompanies genius '' he managed to sketch some women secretly in algiers , as in the painting women of algiers in their apartment ( 1834 ) , but generally he encountered difficulty in finding muslim women to pose for him because of muslim rules requiring that women be covered delacroix drew inspiration from many sources over his career , such as the literary works of william shakespeare and lord byron , or the artistry of michelangelo but from beginning to end of his life , he was in part characterized by a constant need for music , saying in 1855 , '' nothing can be compared with the emotion caused by music ; that it expresses incomparable shades of feeling it was often in music , in the most melancholy renditions of chopin , or the '' pastoral '' works of beethoven that delacroix was often able to draw the most emotion and inspiration though the painting was quickly purchased by the state , delacroix was disappointed when it was sent to the lille musée des beaux-arts ; he had intended for it to hang at the luxembourg , where it would have joined the barque of dante and scenes from the massacres of chios in that year he began work for the salon du roi in the chambre des députés , palais bourbon , which was not completed until 1837 , and began a lifelong friendship with the female artist madame cavé from 1834 until his death , he was faithfully cared for by his housekeeper , jeanne-marie le guillou , who zealously guarded his privacy , and whose devotion prolonged his life and his ability to continue working in his later years private collection file : eugène ferdinand victor delacroix 021.jpg the combat of the giaour and hassan , 1826 , art institute of chicago file : delacroix , eugène ferdinand victor - woman with a parrot - 1827.jpg woman with a parrot , 1827 , museum of fine arts of lyon file : delacroix , la femme aux bas blancs.jpg woman with white socks , 1825–1830 , louvre file : young tiger playing with its mother.jpg a young tiger playing with its mother , 1830 , louvre file : eugène ferdinand victor delacroix 049.jpg the duke of morny 's apartment , 1831–1833 , louvre file : delacroix portrait desmaisons.jpg portrait of dr frankfurt städel museum file : eugène ferdinand victor delacroix 014.jpg the women of algiers , 1834 , louvre file : battle of taillebourg by delacroix.jpg the battle of taillebourg ( draft ) , 1834 & ndash ;
