to prove that the development of '' faster , better and cheaper '' spacecraft was possible ( with three years for development and a cost under 150 & nbsp ; million for the lander , and 25 million for the rover ) to show that it was possible to send a load of scientific instruments to another planet with a simple system and at one-fifteenth the cost of a viking mission ) to demonstrate nasa 's commitment to low-cost planetary exploration by finishing the mission with a total expenditure of 280 & nbsp ; million , including the launch vehicle and mission operations the lander contained a stereo camera with spatial filters on an expandable pole called imager for mars pathfinder ( imp ) , and the atmospheric structure instrument/meteorology package ( asi/met ) which acts as a mars meteorological station , collecting data about pressure , temperature , and winds the sojourner rover had an alpha proton x-ray spectrometer ( apxs ) , which was used to analyze the components of the rocks and soil these instruments could investigate the geology of the martian surface from just a few millimeters to many hundreds of meters , the geochemistry and evolutionary history of the rocks and surface , the magnetic and mechanics properties of the land , as well as the magnetic properties of the dust , atmosphere and the rotational and orbital dynamics of the planet three navcam were on board the rover : two black and white 0.3-megapixel cameras were located on the front ( 768 horizontal pixels × 484 vertical pixels configured in 4×4+100 pixel blocks ) , coupled with five laser stripe projectors , which enabled stereoscopy images to be taken along with measurements for hazard detection on the rover 's path the pixels of this colour camera were arranged in such a way , that out of the 16 pixel of a 4×4 pixel block , 12 pixel were sensitive to green , 2 pixel to red and 2 pixel were sensitive to infrared as well as blue the landing site was an ancient flood plain in mars 's northern hemisphere called '' ares vallis '' ( '' the valley of ares '' , the ancient greek equivalent of the ancient roman deity mars ) and is among the rockiest parts of mars mars pathfinder directly entered mars atmosphere in a retrograde direction from a hyperbolic trajectory at 6.1 & nbsp ; km/s using an atmospheric entry aeroshell ( capsule ) that was derived from the original viking mars lander design the aeroshell consisted of a back shell and a specially designed ablative heatshield to slow to 370 & nbsp ; m/s ( 830 & nbsp ; mph ) where a supersonic disk-gap-band parachute was inflated to slow its descent through the thin martian atmosphere to 68 & nbsp ; m/s ( about 150 & nbsp ; mph ) the lander 's on-board computer estimated the best time to fire the rockets and cut the bridle so that the lander velocity would be reduced to about 0 & nbsp ; m/s between 15 and 25 & nbsp ; m above the ground as the next sols progressed it approached some rocks , which the scientists named '' barnacle bill '' , '' yogi '' , and '' scooby-doo '' , after famous cartoon characters the rover made measurements of the elements found in those rocks and in the martian soil , while the lander took pictures of the sojourner and the surrounding terrain , in addition to making climate observations by the time that final results of the mission were described in a series of articles in the journal science ( december 5 , 1997 ) , it was believed that the rock yogi contained a coating of dust , but was similar to the rock barnacle bill calculations suggest that the two rocks contain mostly the minerals orthopyroxene ( magnesium-iron silicate ) , feldspars ( aluminum silicates of potassium , sodium , and calcium ) , and quartz ( silicon dioxide ) , with smaller amounts of magnetite , ilmenite , iron sulfide , and calcium phosphate the embedded computer on board the sojourner rover was based around the 2 & nbsp ; mhz intel 80c85 cpu with 512 & nbsp ; kb of ram and 176 & nbsp ; kb of flash memory solid-state storage , running a cyclic executive the computer of the pathfinder lander was a ibm rad6000 single chip ( rad6000 sc ) cpu with 128 & nbsp ; mb of ram and 6 & nbsp ; mb of eeprom and its operating system was vxworks online ( by subscription ) which had been found in preflight testing but was deemed a glitch and therefore given a low priority as it only occurred in certain unanticipated heavy-load conditions , and the focus was on verifying the entry and landing code the problem , which was reproduced and corrected from earth using a laboratory duplicate thanks to the logging and debugging functionality enabled in the flight software , was due to computer resets caused by priority inversion during the extended operation a high-resolution stereo panorama of the surrounding terrain was being made , and the sojourner rover was to visit a distant ridge , but the panorama was only about one-third completed and the ridge visit had not begun when communication failed the name sojourner was chosen for the mars pathfinder rover when 12-year old valerie ambroise , of bridgeport , connecticut , won a year-long , worldwide competition in which students up to 18 years old were invited to select a heroine and submit an essay about her historical accomplishments initiated in march 1994 by the planetary society of pasadena , california , in cooperation with nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory ( jpl ) , the contest got under way with an announcement in the january 1995 issue of the national science teachers association 's magazine science and children , circulated to 20,000 teachers and schools across the nation in 1997 , the sojourner team was awarded a jpl award for technical excellence on october 21 , 1997 , at the geological society of america 's annual meeting in salt lake city , utah , sojourner was awarded honorary membership in the planetary geology division of the society in 2003 , sojourner was inducted into the robot hall of fame the opening title sequence of the television series star trek : enterprise features footage of sojourner on the martian surface , intermixed with various other images representative of humankind 's evolution of air and space flight in the 2000 film red planet , astronauts stranded on mars make a makeshift radio from parts of pathfinder , and use it to communicate with their spaceship in the 2011 novel the martian by andy weir , and its the martian ( film ) , the protagonist , mark watney , who is stranded alone on mars , travels to the long-dead pathfinder site , ( noting the '' twin peaks '' as a landmark in the novel ) , and returns it to his base in an attempt to communicate with earth ( 1997 ) sojourner : an insider 's view of the mars pathfinder mission , by andrew mishkin , senior systems engineer , nasa jet propulsion laboratory super-resolution stereo pairs of '' twin peaks '' mars pathfinder mission profile by nasa 's solar system exploration ted stryk 's mars pathfinder page '' a crawl on mars '' —ted stryk 's sojourner rover page nasa office of space science jpl—mars exploration rover mission authoritative account of mpf reset issue—discussion of the software problems on the pathfinder spacecraft a little rock on mars—children 's story about the pathfinder landing pathfinder landing site as seen from orbit by mars reconnaissance orbiter paper model ( source ) magnetic properties experiment
