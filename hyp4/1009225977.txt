since 1649 and prior to the protectorate , england , ireland and later scotland had been governed as a republic by the council of state and the rump parliament the act declaring england to be a commonwealth , which established england , together with '' all the dominions and territoryes thereunto belonging '' , as a republic , had been passed on 19 may 1649 , following the trial and execution of charles i in january of that year on 20 april 1653 , after learning that parliament was attempting to stay in session despite an agreement to dissolve , and having failed to come up with a working constitution , cromwell , with the backing of the grandees in the army council , marched soldiers into the debating chamber and forcibly ended the rump 's session within a month of the rump 's dismissal , oliver cromwell on the advice of thomas harrison and with the support of other officers in the army , sent a request to congregational churches in every county to nominate those they considered fit to take part in the new government however it proved just as difficult for the grandees to control and was in addition a subject of popular ridicule , so on 8 december 1653 mps who supported cromwell engineered its end by passing a dissolution motion at a time of day when the house usually had few members in attendance the collapse of the radical consensus which had spawned the nominated assembly led to the grandees passing the instrument of government in the council of state which paved the way for the protectorate after the dissolution of barebone 's parliament , john lambert put forward a new constitution known as the instrument of government , closely modelled on the heads of proposals it was this—allied to cromwell 's toleration of private worship of non-puritans—that led to his resettlement of the jews in england , 350 years after their banishment by edward i , in the hope that they would help speed up the recovery of the country after the disruption of the civil wars in 1657 , oliver cromwell was offered the crown by parliament as part of a revised constitutional settlement , presenting him with a dilemma , since he had been instrumental in abolishing the monarchy he summoned a parliament in 1659 , but the republicans engaged in '' endless obstruction and filibustering '' and attacked the 'quasi-monarchal ' aspects of the protectorate , and they '' condemned oliver 's rule as a period of tyranny and economic depression '' three things undermined the protectorate : the '' anxieties of the army , the irresponsibility of the parliament and the rashness of richard cromwell '' ; what ultimately prevented the retention of the protectorate was the opposition of the '' junior officers '' and '' many of the common soldiers '' on 7 may a committee of safety was formed on the authority of the rump parliament , displacing the protector 's council of state , and was in turn replaced by a new council of state on 19 may 1659 after richard cromwell was removed from power by the grandees of the new army , the rump parliament was instated and soon after was replaced by the committee of safety and council of state under the authority of charles fleetwood the committee of safety then ordered general john lambert to meet george monck the commander of english forces in scotland and a royalist sympathizer in order to force monck 's submission or defeat according to derek hirst , outside of politics and religion , the 1640s and 1650s saw a revived economy characterized by growth in manufacturing , the elaboration of financial and credit instruments , and the commercialization of communication
