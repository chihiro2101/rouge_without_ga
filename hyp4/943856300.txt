so if a rectangular hyperbola is drawn through four orthocentric points it will have one fixed center on the common nine-point circle but it will have four perspectors one on each of the orthic axes of the four possible triangles the joining of these three orthogonal points into a triangle generates an orthic triangle that is common to all the four possible triangles formed from the four orthocentric points taken three at a time the one point on the nine-point circle that is the center of this rectangular hyperbola will have four different definitions dependent on which of the four possible triangles is used as the reference triangle it is normal to distinguish one of the orthocentric points from the others , specifically the one that is the incenter of the orthic triangle ; this one is denoted h as the orthocenter of the outer three orthocentric points that are chosen as a reference triangle abc because the nine-point circle is common to all four possible triangles in an orthocentric system it is tangent to 16 circles comprising the incircles and excircles of the four possible triangles in a normalized orthocentric system the orthic inconic that is tangent to the sides of the triangle abc is an inellipse and the orthic inconics of the other three possible triangles are hyperbolas the three orthocentric systems are the incenter and excenters , the reference triangle and its orthocenter and finally the orthocenter of the reference triangle together with the three other intersection points that this cubic has with the circumcircle of the reference triangle the orthic axis associated with a normalized orthocentric system a , b , c , and h , where abc is the reference triangle , is a line that passes through three intersection points formed when each side of the orthic triangle meets each side of the reference triangle consequently the circumcircles of the four triangles abc , abh , ach , bch are all equal and form a set of johnson circles as shown in the diagram adjacent these four lines now represent the euler lines of the four possible triangles where the extended line hn is the euler line of triangle abc and the extended line an is the euler line of triangle bch etc the radius of the common nine-point circle is the distance from the nine-point center to the midpoint of any of the six connectors that join any pair of orthocentric points through which the common nine-point circle passes the six connectors that join any pair of the original four orthocentric points will produce pairs of connectors that are orthogonal to each other such that they satisfy the distance equations : ab^2 + ch^2 ac^2 + bh^2 bc^2 + ah^2 4r^2 where r is the common circumradius of the four possible triangles
