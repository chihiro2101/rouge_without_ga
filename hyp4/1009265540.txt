on friday 20 april 2007 , a private member 's bill aimed at exempting members of parliament from the freedom of information act was '' talked out '' by a collection of mps , led by liberal democrats simon hughes and norman baker who debated for five hours , therefore running out of time for the parliamentary day and '' sending the bill to the bottom of the stack '' in the southern rhodesia legislative assembly , independent member dr ahrn palley staged a similar filibuster against the law and order maintenance bill on 22 november 1960 , although this took the form of moving a long series of amendments to the bill , and therefore consisted of multiple individual speeches interspersed with comments from other members the rajya sabha ( council of states ) – which is the upper house in the bicameral parliament of india – allows for a debate to be brought to a close with a simple majority decision of the house , on a closure motion so introduced by any member on april 4 , exhausted and often sleepy government members inadvertently let one of the ndp amendments pass , and the handful of residents of cafon court in etobicoke were granted the right to a public consultation on the bill , although the government subsequently nullified this with an amendment of its own under current senate rules , any modification or limitation of the filibuster would be a rule change that itself could be filibustered , with two-thirds of those senators present and voting ( as opposed to the normal three-fifths of those sworn ) needing to vote to break the filibuster otto lecher , delegate for brno , spoke continuously for twelve hours before the abgeordnetenhaus ( '' house of delegates '' ) of the reichsrat ( '' imperial council '' ) of austria , to block action on the '' ausgleich '' with hungary , which was due for renewal an unusual example of filibustering occurred in march 2017 , when the governing liberal party of newfoundland and labrador had '' nothing else to do in the house of assembly '' and debated between only themselves about their own interim supply bill , after both the conservative and new democratic parties indicated they intended to vote in favour of the bill in the morning of 17 may 2012 , the president of the legco ( jasper tsang ) terminated the debate , citing article 92 of the rules of procedure of legco : in any matter not provided for in these rules of procedure , the practice and procedure to be followed in the council shall be such as may be decided by the president who may , if he thinks fit , be guided by the practice and procedure of other legislatures rarely used for much of the senate 's first two centuries , it was changed first in 1959 , because of repeated filibusters of civil rights legislation , to reduce the number of votes required from the entire chamber to 2/3 of the senate in 2009 , several parties staged a filibuster of the local government ( auckland reorganisation ) bill in opposition to the government setting up a new auckland council under urgency and without debate or review by select committee , by proposing thousands of wrecking amendments and voting in māori as each amendment had to be voted on and votes in māori translated into english senate rules permit a senator or senators to speak for as long as they wish and on any topic they choose , unless '' three-fifths of the senators duly chosen and sworn '' ( usually 60 out of 100 senators ) vote to bring debate to a close by invoking cloture under senate rule xxii the first one was originally the use of the article 49 paragraph 3 procedure , according to which the law was adopted except if a majority is reached on a non-confidence motion ( a reform of july 2008 resulted in this power being restricted to budgetary measures only , plus one time each ordinary session – i.e although this made it easier to end a filibuster , subsequent to this the majority has preferred to avoid filibusters by moving to other business when a filibuster is threatened and attempts to achieve cloture have usually failed charles stewart parnell , a young irish nationalist member of parliament ( mp ) , who in 1880 became leader of the irish parliamentary party , joined him in this tactic to obstruct the business of the house and force the liberals and conservatives to negotiate with him and his party though the filibuster was criticised by the pro-democracy camp , lau kong-wah of the democratic alliance for the betterment and progress of hong kong ( dab ) defended their actions , saying '' it ( a filibuster ) is totally acceptable in a parliamentary assembly '' in an attempt to prevent the passing of bill c-6 , which would have legislated the imposing of a four-year contract and pay conditions on the locked out canada post workers , the new democratic party ( ndp ) led a filibustering session which lasted for fifty-eight hours on november 21 , 2013 , the then-democratic-controlled senate exercised the nuclear option , in a 52–48 vote , to require only a majority vote to end a filibuster of all executive and judicial nominees , excluding supreme court nominees , rather than the 3/5 of votes previously required the tactic was enormously successful , and parnell and his mps succeeded , for a time , in forcing parliament to take the irish question of return to self-government seriously one such example occurred october 26 , 2006 , when he spoke for almost 120 minutes to prevent the house of commons of canada standing committee on environment and sustainable development from studying a private member 's bill to implement the kyoto accord to prevent this particular tactic from being used again , changes were eventually made to the standing orders to limit the time allocated each day to the introduction of bills to 30 minutes as this bill applied government spending to all departments , almost any topic was relevant to the debate , and henderson used the opportunity to list all of his many criticisms of the unionist government in the parliament of the united kingdom , a bill defeated by a filibustering manoeuvre may be said to have been '' talked out '' a second high-profile and uniquely implemented filibuster in the ontario legislature occurred in april 1997 , where the ontario new democratic party , then in opposition , tried to prevent the governing progressive conservatives ' bill 103 from taking effect as the absence of some pro-beijing camp legislators would mean an inadequate support for the passing of the bill , the pro-establishment camp filibustered along with michael suen , the then-secretary for constitutional affairs , the voting of the bill was delayed to the next day and that the absentees could cast their votes paper for the finance committee meeting on 22 february 2013 : members ' motions that seek to amend the procedures of the finance committee and its two subcommittees , legislative council of hong kong the secretariat estimated that 408 man-months ( each containing 156 working hours ) were needed to vet the facts and accuracy of the motions , and , if all amendments were admitted by the chairman , the voting time would take 23,868 two-hour meetings on the other hand , the lok sabha ( house of the people ) – the lower house – leaves the closure of the debate to the discretion of the speaker , once a motion to end the debate is moved by a member as of march 2 , the filibuster completed with a total of 193 hours , and the passing of the bill he also spoke for about 6 hours on february 5 , 2008 and february 7 , 2008 at the house of commons of canada standing committee on procedure and house affairs meetings to block inquiry into allegations that the conservative party in and out scandal amendments included renaming the council to '' auckland katchafire council '' or '' rodney hide memorial council '' and replacing the phrase '' powers of a regional council '' with '' power and muscle '' in france , member of parlement christine boutin spoke for five hours in the french national assembly in november 1999 in an unsuccessful attempt to prevent or postpone the adoption of pacs , a contractual form of civil union open to homosexual couples , which she opposed roman generals honored with a triumph were not allowed to enter the city prior to the ceremony , but candidates for the consulship were required , by law , to appear in person at the forum however , the suspension of standing orders was not intended to delay or stop the passage of legislation , as with a traditional filibuster the filibuster extends from section l176b of the archive to l176ae ; the cafon court slip-up is in section l176h , stockwell rules on the issue of repetition in l176n , and zorra street is reached in l176s in january 2011 , labour peers , including most notably john prescott , were attempting to delay the passage of the parliamentary voting system and constituencies bill 2010 until after 16 february , the deadline given by the electoral commission to allow the referendum on the alternative vote to take place on 5 may to protest the tory government 's legislation that would amalgamate the municipalities of metro toronto into the '' megacity '' of toronto , the small ndp caucus introduced 11,500 amendments to the megacity bill , created on computers with mail merge functionality on february 7 , 2018 , minority leader nancy pelosi set a record for the longest speech on the house floor , speaking for eight hours and seven minutes in support of deferred action for childhood arrivals : she took advantage of the fact that the minority leader is allowed to speak indefinitely without interruption intermediate links may be english freebooter ( 1598 ) , a calque of the dutch equivalent , and flibutor ( 1587 ) : with an -r- altered in an -l- that may have been the result of dissimilation , typical for liquid consonants his filibuster lasted several meetings the last of which he spoke for over 8 hours and was done to support his own motion to hold cross country hearings on the bill so mps could hear what the canadian public thought of the bill on april 6 , with the alphabetical list of streets barely into the es , speaker chris stockwell ruled that there was no need for the 220 words identical in each amendment to be read aloud each time , only the street name in 2014 , irish justice minister alan shatter performed a filibuster ; he was perceived to '' drone on and on '' and hence this was termed a '' drone attack ''
