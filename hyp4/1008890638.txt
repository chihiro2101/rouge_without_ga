species of the genus hippoglossus atlantic halibut , hippoglossus hippoglossus – lives in the north atlantic pacific halibut , hippoglossus stenolepis – lives in the north pacific ocean in july 2014 , a pacific halibut was caught in glacier bay , alaska ; this is , however , discounted from records because the halibut was shot and harpooned before being hauled aboard this color scheme disguises halibut from above ( blending with the ocean floor ) and from below ( blending into the light from the sky ) and is known as countershading animals found in their stomachs include sand lance , octopus , crab , salmon , hermit crabs , lamprey , sculpin , cod , pollock , herring , and flounder , as well as other halibut halibut live at depths ranging from a few meters to hundreds of meters , and although they spend most of their time near the bottom , halibut may move up in the water column to feed in most ecosystems , the halibut is near the top of the marine food chain in canadian and us waters , long-line fishing predominates , using chunks of octopus ( '' devilfish '' ) or other bait on circle hook attached at regular intervals to a weighted line that can extend for several miles across the bottom the effects of long-line gear on habitats are poorly understood , but could include disturbance of sediments , benthic structures , and other structures international management is thought to be necessary , because the species occupies waters of the united states , canada , russia , and possibly japan ( where the species is known to the japanese as ohyo ) , and matures slowly critics of the program suggest , since holders can sell their quota and the fish are a public resource , the ifq system gave a public resource to the private sector a significant sport fishing in alaska and british columbia has emerged , where halibut are prized game and food fish in a reference amount , raw halibut contains rich content ( 20 % of more of the daily value , dv ) of protein , selenium ( 65 % dv ) , phosphorus ( 34 % dv ) , vitamin d ( 32 % dv ) , and several b vitamins : niacin , vitamin b6 , and vitamin b12 ( 42-46 % dv ) cooked halibut meat – presumably through the resulting dehydration – has relatively increased protein content and reduced b vitamin content ( per 100 grams ) , while magnesium , phosphorus , and selenium are rich in content
