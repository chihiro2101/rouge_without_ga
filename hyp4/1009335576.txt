marrano in this context means '' swine '' or '' pig '' , from the ritual prohibition against eating pork , practiced by both jews and muslims however , as applied to crypto-jews , the term marrano may also derive from the spanish verb '' marrar '' ( of germanic rather than arabic origin ) meaning '' to deviate '' or '' to err '' , in the sense that they deviated from their newly adopted faith by secretly continuing to practice judaism a third origin has been cited from galician-portuguese , where marrar means '' to force '' and marrano means '' forced one '' , indicating the compulsory nature of the religious conversions under state pressure in the late 14th and early 15th century , over half of jews in the iberian peninsula converted to christianity , thus avoiding the decree of expulsion which affected spain 's remaining openly jewish population in 1492 a phylogeography study in 2008 of 1,150 volunteer y-chromosome dna haplogroups appeared to support the idea that the number of forced conversions has been significantly underestimated , as 20 % of the tested iberian population had haplogroups consistent with sephardi ancestry martinez gave speeches that led to violence against the jews , and this influence culminated in the sack of the jewish quarter of seville on june 4 , 1391 on march 14 , 1473 , during a dedication procession , a girl accidentally threw dirty water from the window of the house of one of the wealthiest conversos ( the customary way to dispose of it tens of thousands of jews were baptised in the three months before the deadline for expulsion , some 40,000 if one accepts the totals given by kamen : most of these undoubtedly to avoid expulsion , rather than as a sincere change of faith '' later the resistance to the inquisitors was so strong that its

discovered in quintanar de la orden in 1588 ; and there was a rise in denunciations of conversos in the last decade of the sixteenth century at the beginning of the seventeenth century , some conversos who had fled to portugal began to return to spain , fleeing the persecution of the portuguese inquisition , founded in 1536 they instructed the marranos in the tenets and ceremonies of the jewish religion ; held meetings in which they taught them what they must believe and observe according to the mosaic law ; and enabled them to circumcise themselves and their children they furnished them with prayer-books ; explained the fast-days ; read with them the history of their people and their law ; announced to them the coming of the passover ; procured unleavened bread for them for that festival , as well as kosher meat throughout the year ; encouraged them to live in conformity with the law of moses , and persuaded them that there was no law and no truth except the jewish religion although the vast majority of spain 's 250,000 conversos had abandoned judaism and been assimilated into spain 's dominant catholic culture , many of those continuing to secretly practice their former religion felt threatened and persecuted by the inquisition which continued to actively persecute heresy many migrated to italy , attracted by the climate , which resembled that of the iberian peninsula , and by the kindred language a thoroughly researched history of these migrations is also contained in the book about one of their leaders called , '' the woman who defied kings '' , by the historian and journalist andree aelion brooks they were soon so numerous that fernando de goes loureiro , an abbot from oporto , filled an entire book with the names of conversos who had drawn large sums from portugal and had openly avowed judaism in italy two years later , pope paul iv issued orders to have all the conversos in italy be thrown into the prisons of the inquisition which he had instituted sixty of them , who acknowledged the catholic faith as penitents , were transported to the island of malta ; twenty-four , who adhered to judaism , were publicly burned ( may 1556 ) guidobaldo had hoped to have the jews and conversos of turkey select pesaro as a commercial center ; when that did not happen , he expelled the new christians from pesaro and other districts in 1558 ( ib during the 16th and 17th centuries , some conversos migrated to americas , often the castilian territories of the vice-royalties of new spain and peru however , after a short while – if only to compensate partially for the loss of revenues caused by the departure of the jews – the king imposed a special tax , referred to as '' the tax of the neophytes in the '' marrano factory : the portuguese inquisition and its new christians 1536-1765 '' , professor antonio jose saraiva of the university of lisbon , writes '' king manuel theoretically abolished discrimination between old and new christians by the law of march 1 , 1507 which permitted the departure of new christians to any part of the christian world , declaring that they “ be considered , favored and treated like the old christians and not distinct and separated from them in any matter ” nevertheless , in apparent contradiction to that law , in a letter dated almeirim , february 18 , 1519 , king manuel promoted legislation henceforth prohibiting the naming of new christians to the position of judge , town councilor or municipal registrar in goa , stipulating , however , that those already appointed were not to be dismissed '' some new christians sought to re-join jewish populations in india ( particularly through the jewish community in cochin ) , while others went on to be extremely influential in the spice trade , and the gems trade between portugal , and india during this period , the first bishop of goa , gaspar jorge de leão pereira wrote his anti-semitic work '' contra os judeos '' ( tracts against jews ) , and called for the establishment of the goa inquisition ( which was established in 1560 ) there was no significant wave of emigration of conversos from spain , the majority of sephardic communities , such as that of salonika having been formed as a result of the alhambra decree in 1492 conversos from flanders , and others direct from the iberian peninsula , went under the guise of catholics to hamburg and altona about 1580 , where they established a community and held commercial relations with their former homes the vast majority of spain 's conversos , however , remained in spain and portugal and were suspected of '' marranism '' by the spanish inquisition in his luminous book the '' marrano factory : the portuguese inquisition and its new christians 1536-1765 '' , professor antonio jose saraiva of the university of lisbon , writes that '' after august 1531 , when the establishment of the inquisition in portugal was in the offing and especially after june 14 , 1532 when new christian emigration from portugal became a capital offense , anti-new christian sentiment surged on all sides the new christians were panic-stricken and emigrants ,
