many early texas rangers , who had to be expert horse riders and later went on to become ranchers , learned and adapted hispanic techniques and traditions to ranches in the united states melody groves ( 2006 ) , ropes , reins , and rawhide , , although steer riding contests existed into the 1920s , the sport did not gain popularity until bulls were returned to the arena and replaced steers as the mount of choice a pivotal moment for modern bull riding , and rodeo in general , came with the founding of the rodeo cowboy association ( rca ) in 1936 , which later became the professional rodeo cowboys association ( prca ) in addition to the prca , which has prca prorodeo with bull riding and the xtreme bulls events for bull riding only , there is the professional bull riders ( pbr ) , which stages a large number of events in the united states , canada , mexico , brazil , and australia , since 1994 the pbr 's major league tour , currently titled the unleash the beast series , is televised on cbs sports network , with the primary broadcast network televising selected bonus rounds ( known as 15/15 bucking battles ) image : bull-riding-szmurlo.jpg thumb left bull riding at the calgary stampede ; the '' bullfighter '' or '' rodeo clown '' is standing just to the right of the bull the rider and bull are matched randomly before the competition , although starting in 2008 , some ranked riders are allowed to choose their own bulls from a bull draft for selected rounds in pbr events the rider must attempt to stay on the bull for at least eight seconds , while only touching the bull with their riding hand the total points scored by the end of the event are recorded , and after the first or first two go-rounds , the top 20 riders are given a chance to ride one more bull there are many other organizations , and each has their own particular rules on how they score , but most follow rules similar to the prca in the regular season , there are four judges , two judges scoring the bull 's effort from 0–25 points , and two judges scoring the rider 's performance from 0-25 points four judges award a score of up to 25 points each for the rider 's performance , and four judges award up to 25 points each for the bull 's effort for points actually to be awarded , the rider must stay mounted for a minimum of 8 seconds , and they are scored only for actions during those 8 seconds a rider is disqualified for touching the bull , the rope , or themself with their free arm one move particular to bulls is a belly roll ( '' sunfishing '' ) , in which the bull is completely off the ground and kicks either his hind feet or all four feet to the side in a twisting , rolling motion bulls also are more likely than horses to spin in tight , quick circles , and are less likely to run or to jump extremely high ( '' break in two '' ) in some pbr events that use an elimination style bracket , if both riders in a bracket fail to reach eight seconds , the rider who lasts longer advances to the next round the other side of the rope ( the tail ) is a flat braid and is usually coated with rosin to keep it from sliding through the rider 's hand in addition to the sound the bell produces , it also gives the rope some weight , allowing it to fall off the bull once a rider has dismounted the vest ’ s creator , cody lambert , debuted it at the california rodeo salinas in the summer of 1993 , and for several months , he was the only bull rider using one the number of bull riders with vests grew over the months , and by the fall of that year , the vast majority of riders were using them however , starting in the early 1990s , a small number of them were riding either with a protective face mask underneath their hat or with a modified , full ice hockey helmet in 2004 , at the 1st international rodeo research and clinical care conference in calgary , alberta , canada , the licensed rodeo and bull riding medical personnel and clinicians recommended to the rodeo and bull riding associations mentioned in the agreement the mandatory use of helmets to all youth bull riders and the recommendation of helmets to all adult bull riders this rope is to encourage the bull to use his hind legs more in a bucking motion , as this is a true test of a rider 's skill in maintaining the ride common to all arenas is a large , open area that gives the bulls , bull riders , and bull fighters plenty of room to maneuver in the united states and canada , most professional bull riders start out riding in nhsra or other junior associations from there , riders may go on the college rodeo circuit or to one of several national or regional semi-professional associations including the sebra ( sebra ) , the national federation of professional bull riders ( nfpb ) , the international bull riders association ( ibr ) , the professional championship bull riders tour ( pcb ) , the american bull riders tour ( abt ) , bull riders canada ( brc ) , the international professional rodeo association ( ipra ) , the cowboys professional rodeo association ( cpra ) , the united professional rodeo association ( upra ) , the southern rodeo association ( sra ) , the professional western rodeo association ( pwra ) , the canadian cowboys association ( cca ) , among others the latter of which is mexico 's top organization that includes all of american rodeo 's standard events , including bull riding bull riders can win in excess of 100,000 a year while competing in either of these organizations , and it is not uncommon for riders to compete in both of them

professional bull riders from the united states and 25 of australia 's best bull riders contesting the event further , particularly in the case of bulls , an animal that is sick and in pain usually will not want to move at all , will not buck as well , and may even lie down in the chute or ring rather than buck critics also claim that electric cattle prods ( '' hot shots '' ) are used to injure and torture bulls , while supporters of bull riding claim that the cattle prod simply gets the bull out of the chute quickly and is only a moderate irritation due to the thickness of the animal 's hide spurs are also a source of controversy , though modern rodeo rules place strict regulations on the type and use of spurs and participants point out that they are a tool commonly used in other
