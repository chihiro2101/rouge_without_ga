cohen , michael warner , and lauren berlant , argue that they are oppressive , stigmatizing , marginalizing of perceived deviant forms of sexuality and gender , and make self-expression more challenging when that expression does not conform to the norm 5 may 2008 heteronormativity describes how social institutions and policies reinforce the presumption that people are heterosexual and that gender and sex are natural binaries heteronormative culture privileges heterosexuality as normal and natural and fosters a climate where lgbt individuals are discriminated against in marriage , tax codes , and employment the hierarchy places reproductive , monogamous sex between committed heterosexuals as '' good '' and places any sexual acts and individuals who fall short of this standard lower until they fall into '' bad sex '' patrick mccreery , lecturer at new york university , views this hierarchy as partially explanatory for the stigmatization of gay people for socially '' deviant '' sexual practices that are often practiced by straight people as well , such as consumption of pornography or sex in public places mccreery states that this heteronormative hierarchy carries over to the workplace , where gay , lesbian and bisexual individuals face discrimination such as anti-homosexual hiring policies or workplace discrimination that often leaves '' lowest hierarchy '' individuals such as transsexual people vulnerable to the most overt discrimination and unable to find work applicants and current employees can be legally passed over or fired for being non-heterosexual or perceived as non-heterosexual in many countries , such as the case with chain restaurant cracker barrel , which cracker barrel lgbt policies after they fired an employee for being openly lesbian , citing their policy that employees with '' sexual preferences that fail to demonstrate normal heterosexual values were inconsistent with traditional american values analysing the interconnectivity of heteronormativity and sexual employment discrimination , mustafa bilgehan ozturk traces the impact of patriarchal practices and institutions on the workplace experiences of lesbian , gay and bisexual employees in a variety of contexts in turkey , demonstrating further the specific historicities and localised power/knowledge formations that give rise to physical , professional and psycho-emotive acts of prejudice against sexual minorities according to sociology professors samuel perry and kara snawder from university of oklahoma , multiple research studies in the past have shown that there can be and often is a link between the religious beliefs of americans and homophobic behavior june 7 , 2001 nontraditional families ( which diverge from '' a middle-class family with a bread-winning father and a stay-at-home mother , married to each other and raising their biological children '' ) constitute the majority of families in the united states today the concept of heteronormative temporality extends beyond heterosexual marriage to include a pervasive system where heterosexuality is seen as a standard , and anything outside of that realm is not tolerated the child is then usually raised and enculturated as a cisgender heterosexual member of the assigned sex , which may or may not match their emergent gender identity throughout life or some remaining sex characteristics ( for example , chromosomes , genes or internal sex organs ) stroud district council '' gender equality scheme and action plan 2007 '' , defines the state of being transgender as '' non-identification with , or non-presentation as , the sex ( and assumed gender ) one was assigned at birth '' '' usi lgbt campaign – transgender campaign '' ( retrieved 11 january 2012 ) defines transgender people as '' people who were assigned a sex , usually at birth and based on their genitals , but who feel that this is a false or incomplete description of themselves '' transgender is also an umbrella term because , in addition to including trans men and trans women whose gender binary identity is the opposite of their assigned sex ( and who are sometimes specifically termed transsexual if they desire medical assistance to transition ) , it may include genderqueer people ( whose identities are not exclusively masculine or feminine , but may , for example , be bigender , pangender , genderfluid , or agender ) other definitions include third-gender people as transgender or conceptualize transgender people as a third gender , susan stryker , stephen whittle , the transgender studies reader , page 666 : '' the authors note that , increasingly , in social science literature , the term “ third gender ” is being replaced by or conflated with the newer term “ transgender mccreary , handbook of gender research in psychology , volume 1 ( 2010 , , page 486 : '' transgender is a broad term characterized by a challenge of traditional gender roles and gender identity in some cases , gay or lesbian people were forced to undergo sex change treatments to '' fix '' their sex or gender : in some europe during the 20th century , the unkindest cut the science and ethics of castration turing , alan ( 1912–1954 ) and in south africa in the 1970s and 1980s in medical communities with these restrictions , patients have the option of either suppressing transsexual behavior and conforming to the norms of their birth sex ( which may be necessary to avoid social stigma or even violence ) or by adhering strictly to the norms of their '' new '' sex in order to qualify for sex reassignment surgery and hormonal treatments sometimes sex reassignment surgery is a requirement for an official gender change , and often '' male '' and '' female '' are the only choices available , even for intersex and transgender people homonormativity is a term which can refer to the privileging of homosexuality or the assimilation of heteronormative ideals and constructs into lgbtq culture and individual identity although transgender studies scholar susan stryker , in her article '' transgender history , homonormativity , and disciplinary '' , noted that it was also used by transgender activists in the 1990s in reference to the imposition of gay/lesbian norms over the concerns of transgender people in addition , homonormativity can be used today to cover or erase the radical politics of the queer community during the gay liberation , by not only replacing these politics with more conservative goals like marriage equality and adoption rights , but also commercializing and mainstreaming queer subcultures according to penny griffin , politics and international relations lecturer at the university of new south wales , homonormativity upholds neoliberalism rather than critiquing monogamy , procreation , and gender binary as inherently heterosexist and racist duggan asserts that homonormativity fragments lgbt communities into hierarchies of worthiness , and that lgbt people that come the closest to mimicking heteronormative standards of gender identity are deemed most worthy of receiving rights bisexual people , transgender , genderqueer , people of non-western genders , intersex people , queers of color , queer sex workers ) are seen as an impediment to this class of homonormative individuals receiving their rights there are many stereotypes that come with this , as it can be seen in advertising , newspapers , radio , and television for example , mainstream media promote the idea that gay men are more likely to be attracted to advertisements that sell expensive , flamboyant , and possibly feminine products because of their assumed attitudes and way of life
