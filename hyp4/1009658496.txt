hypothesized routes for the earliest migrations have been from hispaniola to the caicos islands , from hispaniola or eastern cuba to great inagua island , and from central cuba to long island ( in the central bahamas ) the settlement sites in the caicos islands differ from those found elsewhere in the bahamas , resembling sites in hispaniola associated with the classic taino settlements that arose after 1200 great inagua is closer to both hispaniola and cuba than any other island in the bahamas , and sites on great inagua contain large quantities of sand-tempered pottery imported from cuba and/or hispaniola , while sites on other islands in the bahamas contain more shell-tempered pottery ( '' palmetto ware '' ) , which developed in the bahamas while trade ( in dugout canoes ) between cuba and long island was reported by columbus , this involved a voyage of at least over open water , although much of that was on the very shallow waters of the great bahama bank moreover , the tainos probably did not settle in central cuba until after 1000 , and there is no particular evidence that this was the route of the initial settlement of the bahamas population density at the time of first european contact was highest in the south central area of the bahamas , declining towards the north , reflecting the progressively shorter time of occupation of the northern islands from cat island the expansion proceeded to eleuthera , from which new providence and andros to the west and great and little abaco islands and grand bahama to the north were reached there are also village sites on east , middle and north caicos and on providenciales , in the caicos islands , at least some of which keegan attributes to a later settlement wave from hispaniola population density in the southernmost bahamas remained lower , probably due to the drier climate there ( less than of rain a year on great inagua island and the turks and caicos islands and only slightly higher on acklins and crooked islands and mayaguana ) keegan:25 , 54–58 , 86 , 170–173 based on lucayan names for the islands , granberry and vescelius argue for two origins of settlement ; one from hispaniola to the turks and caicos islands through mayaguana and acklins and crooked islands to long island and the great and little exuma islands , and another from cuba through great inagua island , little inagua island and ragged island to long island and the exumas granberry & vescelius also state that around 1200 the turks and caicos islands were resettled from hispaniola and were thereafter part of the classical taino culture and language area , and no longer lucayan the lucayans , along with the tainos in jamaica , most of cuba and parts of western hispaniola have been classified as part of a sub-taino , western taino or ciboney taino cultural and language group the lucayans lived in smaller political units ( simple chiefdoms , compared to the more elaborate political structures in hispaniola ) , and their language and culture showed differences , but they remained tainos , although a '' hinterland '' of the wider taino world columbus reported seeing scars on the bodies of some of the men , which were explained to him as resulting from attempts by people from other islands to capture them descriptions of lucayan houses by the spanish match those of houses used by tainos in hispaniola and cuba : shaped like a round tent , tall , made of poles and thatch , with an opening at the top to let smoke out there are no surviving reports of the size of lucayan houses , but estimates of about 20 people per house in taino communities in pre-contact cuba are cited by keegan as a reasonable estimate for lucayan houses on the other hand , lucayan villages were linear , along the coast , often on the leeward side of an island , but also found on the windward side wherever tidal creeks provided some protected shoreline the spanish reported that the tainos also grew sweet potatoes , cocoyams , arrowroot , leren , yampee , peanuts , beans and cucurbits , and the lucayans probably took most , if not all , of those crops with them to the bahamas some ( usually less than one percent of collected shards in most of the bahamas , about ten percent in the caicos islands ) sand-tempered pottery was imported from cuba and/or haiti keegan suggests that the confusion of spellings was due to grammatically differing forms of the name for the chief and for the village or island , or was simply due to columbus 's difficulty with the lucayan language keegan interprets this description to fit the acklins/crooked islands group , with a ship in the west side being able to see the western shore of acklins island across the very shallow waters of the bight of acklins , where there was a village that stretched about along the shore european artifacts of the period have been found on san salvador , the caicos islands , long island , little exuma , acklins island , conception island and samaná cay after columbus 's death , ferdinand ii of aragon ordered in 1509 that indians be imported from nearby islands to make up the population losses in hispaniola , and the spanish began capturing lucayans in the bahamas for use as laborers in hispaniola at first the lucayans sold for no more than four doubloon in hispaniola , but when it was realized that the lucayans were practiced at diving for conches , the price rose to 100 to 150 gold pesos and the lucayans were sent to the isle of cubagua as pearl diving
