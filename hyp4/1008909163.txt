in 2007 he was awarded the majorana prize from the electronic journal of theoretical physics , and in 2009 the klopsteg memorial award from the american association of physics teachers ( aapt ) for '' extraordinary accomplishments in communicating the excitement of physics to the general public , '' he is a fellow of the royal society of canada and the american physical society as a case study , the trouble with physics focused on the issue of the falsifiability of string theory due to the proposals that the anthropic principle be used to explain the properties of our universe in the context of the string landscape lqg is an approach to the unification of quantum mechanics with general relativity which utilizes a reformulation of general relativity in the language of gauge theory , which allows the use of techniques from particle physics , particularly the expression of fields in terms of the dynamics of loops a partial list of smolin 's published work a debate of the merits of string theory between smolin and brian greene , from national public radio ( 2006 ) '' the unique universe '' : smolin explains his skepticism re the multiverse ( 2009 ) closer to the truth : series of interviews by smolin on fundamental issues in physics : smolin 's presentation at the royal society of arts ( 2013 ) he held postdoctoral research positions at the institute for advanced study in princeton , new jersey , the kavli institute for theoretical physics in santa barbara and the university of chicago , before becoming a faculty member at yale , syracuse and pennsylvania state universities he called for a diversity of approaches to quantum gravity , and argued that more attention should be paid to loop quantum gravity , an approach smolin has devised the trouble with physics , on the other hand , was strongly critical of the prominence of string theory in contemporary theoretical physics , which he believes has suppressed research in other promising approaches since 2006 , he has collaborated with the brazilian philosopher and harvard law school professor roberto mangabeira unger on the issues of the reality of time and the evolution of laws ; in 2014 they published a book , its two parts being written separately in the same year that the trouble with physics was published , peter woit published a book for nonspecialists whose conclusion was similar to smolin 's , namely that string theory was a fundamentally flawed research program in his earlier book three roads to quantum gravity ( 2002 ) , smolin stated that loop quantum gravity and string theory were essentially the same concept seen from different perspectives in recent years , he has pioneered two new approaches to the interpretation of quantum mechanics suggested by his work on the reality of time , called the real ensemble interpretation and the principle of precedence when smolin published the theory in 1992 , he proposed as a prediction of his theory that no neutron star should exist with a mass of more than 1.6 times the mass of the sun he was a visiting scholar at the institute for advanced study in 1995 and a visiting professor at imperial college london ( 1999-2001 ) before becoming one of the founding faculty members at the perimeter institute in 2001 , ( 2014 ) , the singular universe and the reality of time : a proposal in natural philosophy , cambridge university press , a book length exposition of smolin 's philosophical views appeared in april 2013 finally , the trouble with physics is also broadly concerned with the role of controversy and the value of diverse approaches in the ethics and process of science '' a possible solution for the problem of time in quantum cosmology '' on edge ( april 7 , 1997 ) the trouble with physics was named by newsweek magazine as number 17 on a list of 50 '' books for our time '' , june 27 , 2009 smolin has contributed to the philosophy of physics through a series of papers and books that advocate the relational , or leibnizian , view of space and time in fecund theory a collapsing black hole causes the emergence of a new universe on the '' other side '' , whose fundamental constant parameters ( masses of elementary particles , planck constant , elementary charge , and so forth ) may differ slightly from those of the universe where the black hole collapsed '' scientific alternatives to the anthropic principle , july 2004 he also advocates '' principles for an open future '' which he claims underlie the work of both healthy scientific communities and democratic societies : '' ( 1 ) when rational argument from public evidence suffices to decide a question , it must be considered to be so decided smolin contributed to the theory of loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) in collaborative work with ted jacobson , carlo rovelli , louis crane , abhay ashtekar and others
