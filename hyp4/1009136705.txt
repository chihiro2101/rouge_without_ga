it then flows in a generally west-southwesterly direction , passing through the towns and villages of rugby , wolston , ( bordering leamington spa ) , warwick , stratford-upon-avon , welford-on-avon , bidford-on-avon , evesham and pershore , before it joins the river severn at tewkesbury the waters were thus trapped : on the north , east and west by the glacier , and by the cotswolds to the south , resulting in the formation of a large glacial lake , which has been called lake harrison from alveston weir , which is upstream of stratford-upon-avon , downstream to tewkesbury and the river severn , the river has been rendered navigable by the construction of locks and weirs overnight moorings are available at stratford-upon-avon , luddington , welford-on-avon , barton , bidford-on-avon , harvington , offenham , evesham , craycombe , wyre , pershore , defford , comberton , birlingham , eckington , strensham and tewkesbury from tewkesbury it follows the course of the river severn , the worcester and birmingham canal and the stratford-upon-avon canal to arrive back at the avon at stratford-upon-avon the navigation works on the avon were originally authorised by an order in council and letters patent of charles i in 1635 , which named william sandys as the grantee , with powers to improve both this river and the river teme the lower avon navigation between evesham and the river severn was leased by george perrott in 1758 , who spent over £4,000 upgrading the locks and weirs to enable 40-ton barges to navigate the river perrott then intended to sell the navigation , but when the stratford canal was being promoted , he had a clause inserted into the bill to force the worcester and birmingham canal to make payments to him in view of the expected drop in tolls that the navigation would experience once the stratford canal was completed , there was fierce competition between the upper and lower avon companies , with coal from the worcester and birmingham coming up-river to evesham , and coal coming down-river from stratford because of the sinuous course of the upper river , it was never really considered as a through navigation , except for a brief period when william james thought it could become a through route he bought all of the shares in the upper avon company in 1813 , and persuaded the stratford canal shareholders that there should be a junction between their canal and the river at stratford , which was opened on 24 june 1816 the navigation was taken over by seven men , all connected with the stratford canal , who turned lucy 's lock at stratford into a two-rise staircase lock , constructed three new locks , and improved the river by dredging by may 1952 , despite being in a period of great austerity , lant had raised over £4,000 towards the work , and the involvement of the royal engineers , who helped with the reconstruction of chadbury lock as a training exercise , increased public awareness , and enabled further public appeals for funds to be made by 1962 , lant had raised over £50,000 , the 7 locks from tewkesbury to evesham were restored to working order , re-opening the lower avon , and plans were already being made to rebuild evesham town lock and press on towards stratford the other waterway to stratford , the stratford-upon-avon canal , had been restored by the national trust and was opened by elizabeth bowes-lyon exactly a month later , and her involvement caught the public 's imagination the estimated cost for the complete restoration was £250,000 , all of which was raised by public subscriptions , with the exception of a grant for £25,000 from the department of the environment , which was made at the time of the phase 1 opening the project , which involved the construction of nine new locks , reopening a navigation which had been derelict for over 100 years , was completed on 1 june 1974 , when queen elizabeth the queen mother returned to stratford to declare it open there have been proposals to extend the navigation upstream from alveston to a link with the grand union canal at either warwick or leamington spa
