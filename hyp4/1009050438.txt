members of isna held the first ever north american demonstration about intersex issues : a 1996 demonstration by morgan holmes , max beck and others as hermaphrodites with attitude outside the annual meeting of the american academy of pediatrics in boston it was ( and to some extent still is ) a common belief that a child 's genitals needed to conform to average genitals of a male or female , so in the first 24 hours after birth , doctors could perform '' extensive reconstructive surgery in order to avoid damage to the child 's mental health '' ( 56 ) in a significant shift from publishing a regular journal titled hermaphrodites with attitude and demonstrating using the same name , the last stated goal of the organization was to eradicate what the organization deemed as '' misleading language '' according to the isna , it made three ground-breaking changes that advocated a patient-centered model , a cautious approach to surgery , and an attempt to get rid of misleading language , all of which were backed by the isna the isna decided its best course of action was to '' support a new organization with a mission to promote integrated , comprehensive approaches to care that enhance the overall health and well-being of persons who are intersex and their families this push was to move away from a model that teaches both that '' intersex is a rare anatomical abnormality '' and that there needs to be immediate surgery to normalize the child 's abnormal genitals , and moved toward the idea that '' intersex is a relatively common anatomical variation from the 'standard ' male and female types '' the suggested solution put forth by the isna was to restructure the system of intersex taxonomy and nomenclature to not include the words 'hermaphrodite ' , 'hermaphroditism ' , 'sex reversal ' , or other similar terms the first issue appeared in winter 1994 , containing six pages of articles , analysis and case studies , including articles by people with lived experience , activists , doctors and academics this means that both intersex people and family members who feel burdened in any way should seek both the help of counselors trained in sex and gender issues and the support from a community of peers experiencing the same situation intersex awareness day intersex civil society organizations intersex human rights intersex rights by country intersex rights in the united states timeline of intersex history
