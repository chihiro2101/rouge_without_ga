the steam generated pressurized the container , but the inner pipe , immersed at the bottom by liquid , and lacking an airtight seal at top , remained at a lower pressure ; expanding steam forced the water at the bottom of the container into and up the pipe to spurt out of a nozzle on top century of inventions one was for a steam-powered pump to supply water to fountains ; the device alternately used a partial vacuum and steam pressure papin describes first pouring a small quantity of water into the bottom of a vertical cylinder , inserting a piston on a rod and after first evacuating the air below the piston , placing a fire beneath the cylinder to boil the water away and create enough steam pressure to raise the piston to the top end of the cylinder the fire was then removed , allowing the cylinder to cool , which condensed steam back into water , thus creating a vacuum beneath the piston upon releasing the catch , the piston was sharply drawn down to the bottom of the cylinder by the pressure differential between the atmosphere and the created vacuum ; enough force was thus generated to raise a weight the way forward was to provide , as savery had , a boiler capable of ensuring the continuity of the supply of steam to the cylinder , providing the vacuum power stroke by condensing the steam , and disposing of the water once it had been condensed unlike savery 's device , pumping was entirely mechanical , the work of the steam engine being to lift a weighted rod slung from the opposite extremity of the rocking beam the earliest examples for which reliable records exist were two engines in the black country , of which the more famous was that erected in 1712 at the conygree coalworks in bloomfield road tipton now the site of '' the angle ring angle ring company limited '' , tipton although its first use was in coal-mining areas , newcomen 's engine was also used for pumping water out of the metal mines in his native west country , such as the tin mines of cornwall the action of the engine was transmitted through a rocking beam engine , the lever e of which rested on the very solid end-gable wall of the purpose-built engine house with the pump side projecting outside of the building , the engine being located in-house from the in-house arch-head d was suspended a piston p working in a cylinder b , the top end of which was open to the atmosphere above the piston and the bottom end closed , apart from the short admission pipe connecting the cylinder to the boiler ; early cylinders were made of cast brass , but cast iron was soon found more effective and much cheaper to produce the piston was surrounded by a seal in the form of a leather ring , but as the cylinder bore was finished by hand and not absolutely true , a layer of water had to be constantly maintained on top of the piston the header tank supplied cold water under pressure via a stand-pipe for condensing the steam in the cylinder with a small branch supplying the cylinder-sealing water ; at each top stroke of the piston excess warm sealing water overflowed down two pipes , one to the in-house well and the other to feed the boiler by gravity the pump equipment was heavier than the steam piston , so that the position of the beam at rest was pump-side down/engine-side up , which was called '' out of the house '' as the low pressure steam from the boiler flowed into the cylinder , the weight of the pump and gear returned the beam to its initial position whilst at the same time driving the water up from the mine on the 1712 engine , the water feed pump was attached to the bottom of the plug tree , but later engines had the pump outside suspended from a separate small arch-head there is a common legend that in 1713 a cock boy named humphrey potter , dionysius lardner , the steam engine familiarly explained and illustrated whose duty it was to open and shut the valves of an engine he attended , made the engine self-acting by causing the beam itself to open and close the valves by suitable cords and catches ( known as the '' potter cord '' ) ; however the plug tree device ( the first form of valve gear ) was very likely established practice before 1715 , and is clearly depicted in the earliest known images of newcomen engines by henry beighton ( 1717 ) ( believed by hulse to depict the 1714 griff colliery engine ) and by thomas barney ( 1719 ) ( depicting the 1712 dudley castle engine ) because of the very heavy steam demands , the engine had to be periodically stopped and restarted , but even this process was automated by means of a buoy rising and falling in a vertical stand pipe fixed to the boiler ( the first pressure gauge ? ) current opinion is that at least on the early engines , dead-weight force pumps were used , the work of the engine being solely to lift the pump side ready for the next downwards pump stroke although the principle of the crank had long been known , pickard managed to obtain a 12-year patent in 1780 for the specific application of the crank to steam engines ; this was a setback to boulton and watt who got round the patent by applying the sun and planet motion to their advanced double-acting rotative engine of 1782 use of the newcomen engine was extended in some places to pump municipal water supply ; for instance the first newcomen engine in france was built at passy in 1726 to pump water from the seine to the city of paris after the water vapor within was cooled enough to create the vacuum , the cylinder walls were cold enough to condense some of the steam as it was admitted during the next intake stroke as the heat losses were related to the surfaces , while useful work related to the volume , increases in the size of the engine increased efficiency , and newcomen engines became larger in time newcomen 's engine was only replaced when james watt improved it in 1769 to avoid this problem ( watt had been asked to repair a model of a newcomen engine by glasgow university ; a small model that exaggerated the problem ) when a valve on the pipe was opened , the vacuum in the condenser would , in turn , evacuate that part of the cylinder below the piston levine , and alessandro nuvolari , do patents encourage or hinder innovation ? the case of the steam engine - there was a rush to install watt engines , and newcomen engines were eclipsed , even in collieries a coal fire heats the water in the boiler which is little more than a covered pan and the steam generated then passes through a valve into the brass cylinder above the boiler the steam in the cylinder is condensed by injecting cold water and the vacuum beneath the piston pulls the inner end of the beam down and causes the pump to move
