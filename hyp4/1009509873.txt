along with eisaku satō , ikeda was an understudy of shigeru yoshida early in his career , and was called an '' honor student '' for his commitment to the ideas presented in the yoshida doctrine , although he was a strong personality himself this was reported in the press as '' let the poor eat barley ! '' ikeda then became minister of international trade and industry following a cabinet reshuffle in 1952 , but was forced to resign less than one month later after he was reported to have said in the diet , in reference to efforts to curb rampant inflation , '' even if five or ten small businessmen commit suicide , it ca n't be helped ikeda was elected president of the ldp and became prime minister in july 1960 , at an extremely difficult moment in japanese domestic politics and u.s.-japan relations ikeda 's immediate predecessor as prime minister , nobusuke kishi , had disastrously mishandled his attempt to revise the anpo ( known as anpo in japanese ) , leading to the massive anpo protests , which were the largest protests in japan 's modern history ikeda had been a compromise candidate to succeed kishi , and had only secured the premiership by promising to call an immediate election , just a few months later in the fall of 1960 given ikeda 's image as an unpopular politician out of touch with the common people and prone to verbal gaffes , few expected ikeda to be anything more than a temporary placeholder prime minister most dramatically of all , ikeda announced his bold income doubling plan , which promised to double the size of japan 's economy in just ten years ' time , by 1970 ikeda 's new image and income doubling plan proved popular , and he won a resounding victory at the polls in the fall , leaving no chance that one of his factional rivals in the ldp could replace him plans were made for kennedy to visit japan in 1964 , but he was assassinated before he could visit , and secretary of state dean rusk went in his stead ikeda also relentlessly pushed japanese trade abroad , in support of his goal to expand export-led economic growth under the income doubling plan in 1962 , then french president charles de gaulle famously referred to ikeda as '' that transistor salesman , '' signalling that japan was becoming more known for exporting electronics than for the cheap toys , bicycles , and textiles it had exported in the 1950s domestically , ikeda fulfilled his promise to expand the social safety net in support of the income doubling plan ikeda took a number of steps to tame intra-party factional infighting , including appointing an '' all-faction cabinet '' with members from enemy factions , and bringing his bitter rival ichirō kōno into his government as agriculture minister , construction minister , and finally minister in charge of planning the 1964 tokyo olympics , thus allowing kōno to accrue much of the glory and credit for the successful olympic games , which were seen as japan 's '' coming out party '' after completing postwar reconstruction by 1963 , ikeda was also powerful enough to announce , over the objection of many conservatives in his own party , that the ldp would renounce any effort to revive constitution of japan and specifically article 9 , which forbade japan from maintaining a military on 25 october , the day after the closing of the 1964 summer olympics in tokyo , ikeda announced his resignation ikeda 's longstanding rival ichirō kōno , respected his dying wish and declined to run for party president , clearing the way for satō to succeed to the premiership in particular , ikeda 's renunciation of constitutional revision , long seen as a holy grail by ldp conservatives , set the course for japan 's stable conservative rule under u.s '' although the initial target growth rate of the plan was 7.2 % per year , by the mid 1960s japan 's gdp growth rate reached as high as 11.6 % , and averaged greater than 10 % over the entire decade , with the economy achieving the goal of doubling its size in less than seven years perhaps even more importantly , according to kapur , ikeda 's income doubling plan '' enshrined 'economic growthism ' as a sort of secular religion of both the japanese people and their government , bringing about a circumstance in which both the effectiveness of the government and the worth of the populace came to be measured above all by the annual percentage change in gdp
