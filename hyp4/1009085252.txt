in that nineteenth-century social and historical context , the term '' conspicuous consumption '' applied narrowly in association with the men , women , and families of the upper class who applied their great wealth as a means of publicly manifesting their social power and prestige , either real or perceived in the twentieth century the significant improvement of the material standard of living of societies and the consequent growth of the middle class saw the term '' conspicuous consumption '' broadly applied to the men , women , and households who possessed the discretionary income that allowed them to practice the patterns of economic consumerism—of goods and services—which were motivated by the desire for prestige , the public display of social status , rather than by the intrinsic , practical utility of the goods and the services proper in the 1920s economists , such as paul nystrom ( 1878–1969 ) , proposed that changes in the style of life , made feasible by the economics of the industrial age , had induced in the mass of society a '' philosophy of futility '' that would increase the consumption of goods and services as a social fashion – i.e conspicuous compassion , the practice of publicly donating large sums of money to charity to enhance the reputation of the donor , is sometimes described as a type of conspicuous consumption as proposed by thorstein veblen in the 19th century , conspicuous consumption explains the psychological mechanics of a consumer society , and the increase in the number and the types of the goods and services that people consider necessary to and for their lives in a developed economy each variant interpretation and complementary explanation is derived from thorstein veblen 's original sociologic proposition in the theory of the leisure class : that conspicuous consumption is a psychological end in itself , from which the practitioner ( man , woman , family ) derived the honour of superior social status trigg defined conspicuous consumption as the behaviours whereby a man or a woman can display great wealth , by means of idleness—expending much time in the practice of leisure activities , and spending much money to consume luxury goods and services aggressive ostentation – in the television report '' aggressive ostentation '' ( 2009 ) , dick meyer said that conspicuous consumption is a form of anger towards society , an '' aggressive ostentation '' that is an antisocial behaviour , which arose from the social alienation suffered by men , women , and families who feel they have become anonymity in and to their societies , which feeling of alienation is aggravated by the decay of the communitarian ethic essential to a person feeling him or herself part of the whole society the negative consequences of either buying or building an oversized house was either the loss of or the reduction of the family 's domestic recreational space—the back yard and the front yard ; the spending of old-age retirement funds to pay for a too-big house ; and over-long commuting time , from house to job , and vice versa , because the required plot of land was unavailable near a city these assumptions , required for the development of a general theory of brand selection and brand purchase , are problematic , because the resultant theories tend either to misunderstand or to ignore the '' irrational '' element in the behaviour of the buyer-as-consumer ; and because conspicuous consumption is a behaviour predominantly '' psychological '' in motivation and expression , therefore , a comprehensive , general theory of conspicuous consumption would require a separate construct for the psychological ( irrational ) elements of the socio-economic phenomenon that is conspicuous consumption high levels of conspicuous consumption may be seen as socially undesirable on two grounds ; firstly , as it is often associated with high relative income , high levels of conspicuous consumption may be an indicator of high levels of income inequality , which may be found intrinsically or instrumentally objectionable ; secondly conspicuous consumption differs from other forms of consumption in that the main reason for the purchase of positional goods is not due to the additional direct utility provided by the good 's alleged high quality , but rather the social prestige associated with the consumption of that good in this case , the externality is status anxiety , the loss of social status suffered by people whose stock of high-status goods ( positional goods ) is diminished , in relation to the stocks of other conspicuous consumers , as they increase their consumption of high-status goods and services ; effectively , status-seeking is a zero-sum game—by definition , the rise of one person in the social class can occur only at the expense of other people therefore , the conspicuous consumption of luxury goods and services ( positional goods ) is an economic loss—like competitive military spending ( an arms race ) , wherein each country must match the military expenditures of other countries in the arms race , or suffer a loss of relative military power frank proposed the application of a progressive consumption tax ; in the article '' the big city : rich and poor , consumed by consuming '' ( 1998 ) , john tierney said that as a remedy for the social and psychological malaise that is conspicuous consumption , the personal income tax should be replaced with a progressive tax upon the yearly sum of discretionary income spent on the conspicuous consumption of goods and services because the activity of conspicuous consumption , itself , is a form of superior good , diminishing the income inequality of the income distribution by way of an egalitarian policy reduces the conspicuous consumption of positional goods and services pigou said that the redistribution of wealth might lead to great gains in social welfare : the economic case for the taxation of positional , luxury goods has a long history ; in the mid-19th century , in principles of political economy with some of their applications to social philosophy ( 1848 ) , john stuart mill said : '' conspicuous nonconsumption '' is a phrase used to describe a conscious choice to opt out of consumption with the intention of sending deliberate social signals
