littlewood was born on 9 june 1885 in rochester , kent , the eldest son of edward thornton littlewood and sylvia maud ( née ackland ) littlewood died on 6 september 1977 however , the link between the riemann hypothesis and the prime number theorem had been known before in continental europe , and littlewood wrote later in his book , a mathematician 's miscellany that his rediscovery of the result did not shed a positive light on the isolated nature of british mathematics at the time spencer reported that in 1941 when he ( spencer ) was about to get on the boat that would take him home to the united states , littlewood reminded him : '' n , n alpha , n beta ! '' ( referring to littlewood 's conjecture ) he worked with mary cartwright on problems in differential equations arising out of early research on radar : their work foreshadowed the modern theory of dynamical systems he also , with hardy , identified the work of the indian mathematician srinivasa ramanujan as that of a genius , and supported him in travelling to the uk and working at cambridge a self-taught mathematician , ramanujan later became a fellow of the royal society , fellow of trinity college , cambridge , and widely recognised as on a par with other geniuses such as euler and jacobi ' '' there is a story ( related in the miscellany ) that at a conference littlewood met a german mathematician who said he was most interested to discover that littlewood really existed , as he had always assumed that littlewood was a name used by hardy for lesser work which he did not want to put out under his own name ; littlewood apparently roared with laughter there are versions of this story involving both norbert wiener and edmund landau , who , it is claimed , '' so doubted the existence of littlewood that he made a special trip to great britain to see the man with his own eyes ''
