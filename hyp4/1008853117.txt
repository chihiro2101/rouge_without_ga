the basal leaves and the lower stem leaves have petioles , and as the leaves progress up the stem the petioles often decrease in length some species have linear to leaf shape leaves , and others have leaf shape ; often the leaves decrease in size as they progress up the stems the tubes of the corolla are hairless or sparsely hairy , and the leaf are spreading , reflexed , or drooping in habit and leaf shape like all asteraceae , the flowering structure is a composite inflorescence , with rose-colored ( rarely yellow or white ) flower arranged in a prominent , somewhat cone-shaped head – '' cone-shaped '' because the petals of the outer ray florets tend to point downward ( are reflexed ) once the flower head opens , thus forming a cone the generic name echinacea is rooted in the greek word ἐχῖνος ( echinos ) , meaning hedgehog , in reference to the spiky appearance and feel of the flower heads united states department of agriculture , agricultural research service the research concluded that of the 40 genetically diverse populations of echinacea studied , there were ten distinct species pallida ) , different plant segments ( roots , flowers , extracts ) , different preparations ( extracts and expressed juice ) , and different chemical compositions which complicate understanding of a potential effect although there are multiple scientific reviews and meta-analysis published on the supposed immunological effects of echinacea , there are significant variability of products used among studies leading to limited conclusions about effects and safety because existing data is solely derived from cell cultures , and antiviral effects in humans have not been elucidated , regulatory agencies have not recommended the use of echinacea preparations for the prophylaxis and treatment of covid-19 when taken by mouth , echinacea does not usually cause side effects , but may have undesirable interactions with various drugs prescribed for diseases , such as heart disease , bleeding , and autoimmune diseases , such as rheumatoid arthritis , lupus , or psoriasis although there are no specific case reports of drug interactions with echinacea , safety about taking echinacea supplements is not well-understood , with possibilities that it may cause side effects , such as nausea , stomach upset or diarrhea , and that it may have adverse reactions with other medications one of the most extensive and systematic studies to review the safety of echinacea products concluded that overall , '' adverse events are rare , mild and reversible , '' with the most common symptoms being '' gastrointestinal and skin-related there are isolated case reports of rare and idiosyncratic reactions including thrombocytopenic purpura , leucopenia , hepatitis , kidney failure , and atrial fibrillation , although it is not clear that these were due to echinacea itself '' a comprehensive echinacea germplasm collection located at the north central regional plant introduction station '' , usda many cultivars exist , and many of them are asexually propagated to keep them true to type the kiowa used it for coughs and sore throats , the cheyenne for sore throats , the pawnee for headaches , and many tribes including the lakota used it as a analgesic .
