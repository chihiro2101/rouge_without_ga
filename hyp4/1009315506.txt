the term jack occurs in several related terms : the registered jack or modular jack in rj11 , rj45 and other similar connectors used for telecommunication and computer networking the telephone jack of manual telephone switchboards , which is the socket fitting the original telephone plug the phone jack common to many electronic applications in various configurations , sometimes referred to as a headphone jack the rca jack , also known as a phono jack , common to consumer audiovisual electronics the eiaj jack for consumer appliances requiring a power supply of less than 18.0 & nbsp ; volts in other applications the two ends are terminated differently , either with male and female of the same connector ( as in an extension cord ) , or with incompatible connectors , which is sometimes called an adapter cable according to the asme , the stationary ( more fixed ) connector of a pair is classified as a jack ( denoted j ) , usually attached to a piece of equipment as in a chassis-mount or panel-mount connector they can be used to join multiple conductors , to connect wires to a printed circuit board , or to terminate a cable into a plug or socket in addition to the classes mentioned above , connectors are characterised by their pinout , method of connection , materials , size , contact resistance , insulation , mechanical durability , ip code , lifetime ( number of cycles ) , and ease of use the movable ( less fixed ) connector is classified as a plug ( denoted p ) , designed to attach to a wire , cable or removable electrical assembly a common example is the multi-conductor flat ribbon cable used in computer disk drives ; to terminate each of the many ( approximately 40 ) wires individually would be slow and error-prone , but an insulation displacement connector can terminate all the wires in a single action in some cases the blade is an integral manufactured part of a component ( such as a switch or a speaker unit ) , and the reciprocal connector is pushed onto the device 's connector the majority of connector failures result in intermittent connections or open contacts : normalized failure mode distributions were originally compiled from a combination of : mil-hdbk-978 , “ nasa parts application handbook ” , 1991 ; mil-hdbk-338 , “ electronic reliability design handbook ” , 1994 ; “ reliability toolkit : commercial practices edition '' , reliability analysis center ( rac ) , 1998 ; and “ failure mode , effects , and criticality analysis ( fmeca ) ” , rac , 1993 whilst technically inaccurate , electrical connectors can be viewed as a type of adapter to convert between two connection methods , which are permanently connected at one end and ( usually ) detachable at the other end often , but not always , sockets are permanently fixed to a device as in a chassis connector , and plugs are attached to a cable the clamping screw may act in the longitudinal axis ( parallel to the wire ) or the transverse axis ( perpendicular to the wire ) , or both many plug and socket connectors are attached to a wire or cable by soldering conductors to electrodes on the back of the connector adapter bent pin analysis cable gland electrical contacts electrical network electrical splice electrical termination gender of connectors and fasteners lightbulb socket pothead for a termination on a high voltage electric power cable tee connector tube socket wire nut when wires are to be soldered to the back of a connector , a backshell is often used to protect the connection and add strain relief in this example , the solder tabs connected to the cable represent the permanent connection , whilst the male connector portion interfaces with a female socket forming a detachable connection effective crimp connections deform the metal of the connector past its yield point so that the compressed wire causes tension in the surrounding connector , and these forces counter each other to create a high degree of static friction plug and socket connectors are usually made up of a male plug ( typically pin contacts ) and a female socket ( typically receptacle contacts ) this can cause problems because the thermal conductivity of metals causes heat to quickly distribute through the cable and connector , and when this heat melts plastic dielectric , it can cause short circuits or '' flared '' ( conical ) insulation plugs and sockets are widely used in various connector systems including blade connectors , breadboards , xlr connectors , car power outlets , banana connectors , and phone connectors
