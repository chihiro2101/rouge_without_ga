by the early 19th century , agricultural techniques , implements , seed stocks , and cultivars had so improved that yield per land unit was many times that seen in the middle ages in 1892 , the first gasoline engine tractor was successfully developed , and in 1923 , the international harvester farmall tractor became the first all-purpose tractor , marking an inflection point in the replacement of draft animals with machines the identification of nitrogen , phosphorus , and potassium ( npk ) as critical factors in plant growth led to the manufacture of synthetic fertilizers , further increasing crop yields npk fertilizers stimulated the first concerns about industrial agriculture , due to concerns that they came with side effects such as soil compaction , soil erosion , and declines in overall soil fertility , along with health concerns about toxic chemicals food chain ( ebook } the discovery of vitamins and their role in nutrition , in the first two decades of the 20th century , led to vitamin supplements , which in the 1920s allowed some livestock to be raised indoors , reducing their exposure to adverse natural elements there are concerns over the sustainability of industrial agriculture , and the environmental effects of fertilizers and pesticides , which has given rise to the organic movement and has built a market for sustainable intensive farming , as well as funding for the development of appropriate technology it is commonly used to reverse pasture degradation , a process characterized by loss of forage and decreased animal carrying capacity which results from overgrazing , poor nutrient management , and lack of soil conservation management practices which improve soil health and consequently grass productivity include irrigation , soil scarification , and the application of lime , fertilizers , and pesticides depending on the productivity goals of the target agricultural system , more involved restoration projects can be undertaken to replace invasive and under-productive grasses with grass species that are better suited to the soil and climate conditions of the region rotational grazing is a variety of foraging in which herds or flocks are regularly and systematically moved to fresh , rested grazing areas ( sometimes called paddocks ) to maximize the quality and quantity of forage growth animal welfare and the intensification of animal production : an alternative interpretation , food and agriculture organization of the united nations , 2005 '' history of factory farming '' , united nations : '' fifty years ago in europe , intensification of animal production was seen as the road to national food security and a better diet why the organic revolution had to happen , the observer , april 21 , 2001 : '' nor is a return to 'primitive ' farming practices the only alternative to factory farming and highly intensive agriculture '' factory farms – the only answer to our growing appetite ? , the guardian , december 29 , 1964 : '' factory farming , whether we like it or not , has come to stay in a year which has been as uneventful on the husbandry side as it has been significant in economic and political developments touching the future of food procurement , the more far-seeing would name the growth of intensive farming as the major development ) '' head to head : intensive farming '' , bbc news ,

operations '' ( cafo ) , or '' intensive livestock operations '' , can hold large numbers ( some up to hundreds of thousands ) of cows , hogs , turkeys , or chickens , often indoors food and water is delivered to the animals , and therapeutic use of antimicrobial agents , vitamin supplements , and growth hormones are often employed , with natural dominant behaviors bred out ) , physical restraints to stop interaction , such as individual cages for chickens , or physical modification such as the de-beaking of chickens to reduce the harm of fighting with the availability of molecular genetics in arabidopsis and rice the mutant genes responsible ( reduced height ( rht ) , gibberellin insensitive ( gai1 ) and slender rice ( slr1 ) ) have been cloned and identified as cellular signalling components of gibberellic acid , a phytohormone involved in regulating stem growth via its effect on cell division however , the advantage is lost for the progeny of the f1 hybrids , meaning seeds for annual crops need to be purchased every season , thus increasing costs and profits for farmers crop rotation or crop sequencing is the practice of growing a series of dissimilar types of crops in the same space in sequential seasons for benefits such as avoiding pathogen and pest buildup that occurs when one species is continuously cropped a traditional component of crop rotation is the replenishment of nitrogen through the use of legumes and green manure in sequence with cereals and other crops , '' water resources : agricultural and environmental issues '' , bioscience 54.10 ( oct 2004 ) , p909 flood irrigation , the oldest and most common type , is typically unevenly distributed , as parts of a field may receive excess water in order to deliver sufficient quantities to other parts solutions include : cover crops ( especially those with allelopathic properties ) that out-compete weeds or inhibit their regeneration multiple herbicides , in combination or in rotation strains genetically engineered for herbicide tolerance locally adapted strains that tolerate or out-compete weeds tilling ground cover such as mulch or plastic manual removal mowing grazing burning in agriculture , a terrace is a leveled section of a hilly cultivated area , designed as a method of soil conservation to slow or prevent the rapid surface runoff of irrigation water the human landscapes of rice cultivation in terraces that follow the natural contours of the escarpments , like contour ploughing , are a classic feature of the island of bali and the banaue rice terraces in banaue , ifugao , philippines paddy fields are a typical feature of rice-growing countries of east and southeast asia , including malaysia , china , sri lanka , myanmar , thailand , korea , japan , vietnam , taiwan , indonesia , india , and the philippines intensive farming practices which are thought to be sustainable have been developed to slow the deterioration of agricultural land and even regenerate soil health and ecosystem services vertical farming is intensive crop production on a large scale in urban centers , in multi-story , artificially-lit structures , for the production of low-calorie foods like herbs , microgreens , and lettuce an integrated farming system is a progressive , sustainable agriculture system such as zero waste agriculture or integrated multi-trophic aquaculture , which involves the interactions of multiple species elements of this integration can include : intentionally introducing flowering plants into agricultural ecosystems to increase pollen-and nectar-resources required by natural enemies of insect pests oregon state university – integrated farming systems – insectary plantings – enhancing biological control with beneficial insectary plants using crop rotation and cover crops to suppress nematodes in potatoes oregon state university – integrated farming systems – nematode suppression by cover crops integrated multi-trophic aquaculture is a practice in which the by-products ( wastes ) from one species are recycled to become inputs ( fertilizers , food ) for another holistic planned grazing is similar to rotational grazing but accentuates the four principles of the water cycle , the mineral cycles ( including the carbon cycle ) , energy flow and ecology the challenges and issues of industrial agriculture for society , for the sector , and for animal rights , include the costs and benefits of both current practices and proposed changes to those practices industrial agriculture uses huge amounts of water , energy , and chemical industry , increasing pollution in the arable land , usable water , and atmosphere office of technology assessment concluded that regarding industrial agriculture , there is a '' negative relationship between the trend toward increasing farm size and the social conditions in rural communities '' on a '' statistical level ''
