as well as saunders-roe and vickers ( which combined in 1966 to form the british hovercraft corporation ( bhc ) ) , other commercial craft were developed during the 1960s in the uk by cushioncraft ( part of the britten-norman group ) and hovermarine based at woolston ( the latter being surface effect ship , where the sides of the hull projected down into the water to trap the cushion of air with normal hovercraft skirts at the bow and stern ) the british aircraft and marine engineering company saunders-roe built the first practical human-carrying hovercraft for the national research development corporation , the sr.n1 , which carried out several test programmes in 1959 to 1961 ( the first public demonstration was in 1959 ) , including a cross-channel test run in july 1959 , piloted by peter '' sheepy '' lamb , an ex-naval test pilot and the chief test pilot at saunders roe shaped like a section of a large aerofoil ( this creates a low pressure area above the wing much like an aircraft ) , the craft was propelled by four aero engines driving two submerged marine propellers , with a fifth engine that blew air under the front of the craft to increase the air pressure under it latimer-needham and cockerell devised a high skirt design , which was fitted to the sr.n1 to produce the mk v , bill gunston , '' hydrofoils and hovercraft : new vehicles for sea and land '' , doubleday , 1969 , p.93 displaying hugely improved performance , with the ability to climb over obstacles almost as high as the skirt during the 1960s , saunders-roe developed several larger designs that could carry passengers , including the sr.n2 , which operated across the solent , in 1962 , and later the sr.n6 , which operated across the solent from southsea to ryde on the isle of wight for many years cockerell 's group was the first to develop the use of a ring of air for maintaining the cushion , the first to develop a successful skirt , and the first to demonstrate a practical vehicle in continued use apart from the craft designed as '' racing hovercraft '' , which are often only suitable for racing , there is another form of small personal hovercraft for leisure use , often referred to as cruising hovercraft , capable of carrying up to four people the hovercraft 's inventor , sir christopher cockerell , claimed late in his life that the falklands war could have been won far more easily had the british military shown more commitment to the hovercraft ; although earlier trials had been conducted in the falkland islands with an srn-6 , the hovercraft unit had been disbanded by the time of the conflict mackace ( mackley air cushion equipment ) , now known as hovertrans , produced a number of successful hoverbarges , such as the 250 & nbsp ; ton payload '' sea pearl '' , which operated in abu dhabi , and the twin 160 & nbsp ; ton payload '' yukon princesses '' , which ferried trucks across the yukon river to aid the pipeline build since the channel routes abandoned hovercraft , and pending any reintroduction on the scottish route , the united kingdom 's only public hovercraft service is that operated by hovertravel between southsea ( portsmouth ) and ryde on the isle of wight when air was blown into the space between the sheets it exited the bottom of the skirt in the same way it formerly exited the bottom of the fuselage , re-creating the same momentum curtain , but this time at some distance from the bottom of the craft although developed elsewhere in the world for both civil and military purposes , except for the solent ryde to southsea crossing , hovercraft disappeared from the coastline of britain until a range of griffon hovercraft were bought by the royal national lifeboat institution when deforming pressure was applied to the outside of this design , air pressure in the rest of the skirt forced the inner wall to move in as well , keeping the channel open in spite of tireless efforts to arrange funding , no branch of the military was interested , as he later joked , '' the navy said it was a plane not a boat ; the air force said it was a boat not a plane ; and the army was 'plain not interested on examination of the craft afterwards , it was found that she had been dished in the bow due to excessive speed , damage that was never allowed to be repaired , and was from then on affectionately referred to as the 'royal dent' some hovercraft use ducting to allow one engine to perform both tasks by directing some of the air to the skirt , the rest of the air passing out of the back to push the craft forward they were not especially good as vacuum cleaners as the air escaping from under the cushion blew uncollected dust in all directions , nor as hovercraft as their lack of a skirt meant that they only hovered effectively over a smooth surface demonstrated at the farnborough airshow in 1960 , it was shown that this simple craft can carry a load of up to 12 marines with their equipment as well as the pilot and co-pilot with only a slight reduction in hover height proportional to the load carried through these improvements , the hovercraft became an effective transport system for high-speed service on water and land , leading to widespread developments for military vehicles , search and rescue , and commercial operations as part of consolidation of british helicopter activities by several aero companies into one experiments with the skirt design demonstrated a problem ; it was originally expected that pressure applied to the outside of the skirt would bend it inward , and the now-displaced airflow would cause it to pop back out by the 1950s , ford showed a number of toy models of cars using the system , but mainly proposed its use as a replacement for wheels on trains , with the levapads running close to the surface of existing rails heseltine was accused by airey neave and others of misleading the house of commons when he stated that the government was still considering giving financial support to the hovertrain , when the decision to pull the plug had already been taken by the cabinet '' the future of hovercraft '' hovercraft museum at lee-on-solent , gosport , uk 1965 film of the denny d2 hoverbus from the scottish screen archive , national library of scotland hovercraft resource royal marines super hovercraft simple potted history of the hovercraft hovercraft club of great britain it was later found that the craft 's hover height was improved by the addition of a skirt of flexible fabric or rubber around the hovering surface to contain the air a real benefit of air cushion vehicles in moving heavy loads over difficult terrain , such as swamps , was overlooked by the excitement of the british government funding to develop high-speed hovercraft the first passenger-carrying hovercraft to enter service was the vickers va-3 , which , in the summer of 1962 , carried passengers regularly along the north wales coast from moreton , merseyside , to rhyl ) and reach places often inaccessible by any other type of craft , makes them suitable for a number of roles , such as survey work and patrol and rescue duties in addition to personal leisure use hovercraft used to ply between the gateway of india in mumbai and cbd belapur and vashi in navi mumbai between 1994 and 1999 , but the services were subsequently stopped due to the lack of sufficient water transport infrastructure cockerell came across the key concept in his design when studying the ring of airflow when high-pressure air was blown into the annular area between two concentric tin cans ( one coffee and the other from cat food ) and a hair dryer another discovery was that the total amount of air needed to lift the craft was a function of the roughness of the surface it travelled over the service ceased on 1 october 2000 after 32 & nbsp ; years , due to competition with traditional ferries , catamaran , the disappearance of duty-free shopping within the eu , the advancing age of the sr.n4 hovercraft and the opening of the channel tunnel the soviet union was also one of the first nations to use a hovercraft , the bora , as a guided missile corvette , though this craft possessed rigid , non-inflatable sides alternative over-water vehicles , such as wave-piercing catamarans ( marketed as the seacat in the uk until 2005 ) , use less fuel and can perform most of the hovercraft 's marine tasks in theory , only a small amount of active airflow would be needed to create lift and much less than a design that relied only on the momentum of the air to provide lift , like a helicopter this produced a ring of airflow , as expected , but he noticed an unexpected benefit as well ; the sheet of fast moving air presented a sort of physical barrier to the air on either side of it since 2006 , hovercraft have been used in aid in madagascar by hoveraid , an international ngo who use the hovercraft to reach the most remote places on the island on vehicles with several engines , one usually drives the fan ( or impeller ) , which is responsible for lifting the vehicle by forcing high pressure air under the craft bethel is far removed from the alaska road system , thus making the hovercraft an attractive alternative to the air based delivery methods used prior to introduction of the hovercraft service the skirt and air distribution design on high-speed craft again is more complex , as they have to cope with the air cushion being washed out by a wave and wave impact currently , the royal marines use the griffonhoverwork 2400td hovercraft , the replacement for the griffon 2000 tdx class acv which was deployed operationally by the marines in the 2003 invasion of iraq hoverlloyd ran services from ramsgate harbour , england , to calais , france , and european ferries also started a service to calais from dover , which was soon superseded by that of seaspeed instead of using two separate rubber sheets to form the skirt , a single sheet of rubber was bent into a u shape to provide both sides , with slots cut into the bottom of the u forming the annular vent the initial concept of the air cushion barge has always been to provide a low-tech amphibious solution for accessing construction sites using typical equipment found in this area , such as diesel engines , ventilating fans , winches and marine equipment these were later joined by the french-built sedam n500 naviplane with a capacity of 385 passengers and 45 cars ; only one entered service and was used intermittently for a few years on the cross-channel service until returned to sncf in 1983 hovercraft are still manufactured in the uk , near to where they were first conceived and tested , on the isle of wight today , they are found primarily in military use for amphibious operations , search and rescue vehicles in shallow water , and sporting vehicles the design featured an engine mounted to blow from the front of the craft into a space below it , combining both lift and propulsion developed and tested in the mid-1970s , the lacv-30 was used by the us army to transport military cargo in logistics-over-the-shore operations from the early 1980s thru the mid 1990s it proved an extremely successful design for a littoral fast attack craft , but due to fiscal reasons and doctrinal change in the navy , the hovercraft was soon withdrawn over 20 & nbsp ; million passengers had used the service as of 2004 – the service is still operating and is by far the longest , continuously operated hovercraft service latimer-needham , who sold his idea to westland ( by then the parent of saunders-roe 's helicopter and hovercraft interests ) , and who worked with cockerell to develop the idea further in august 2010 , the hovercraft club of great britain hosted the world hovercraft championships at towcester racecourse the world hovercraft championships are run under the auspices of the world hovercraft federation in addition to providing the lift air , a portion of the airflow was bled off into two channels on either side of the craft , which could be directed to provide thrust what actually happened is that the slight narrowing of the distance between the walls resulted in less airflow , which in turn led to more air loss under that section of the skirt the project was abandoned in 1977 due to lack of funding , the death of its lead engineer and the adoption of the tgv by the french government as its high-speed ground transport solution
