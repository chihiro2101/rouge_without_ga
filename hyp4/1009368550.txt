during the pleistocene it occurred in vast parts of eurasia , north america and until the middle pleistocene ( about 1.5 million years ago ) even in africa ( bbc news ) paul rincon , '' big cat fossil found in north sea '' , 18 november 2008 accessed 18 november 2008 there has also been a discovery of 1.8-million-year-old fossils in venezuela , indicating that scimitar-toothed cats were able to invade south america along with smilodon during the great american interchange new saber-toothed cat records ( felidae : machairodontinae ) for the pleistocene of venezuela , and the great american biotic interchange journal of vertebrate paleontology , 31 ( 2 ) , 468-478 doi : 10.1080/02724634.2011.550366 how long they lasted in south america is not yet evident moreover , the bones of the young mammoths found in friesenhahn cave show distinctive marks matching the incisors of homotherium , indicating that they could efficiently process most of the meat on a carcass and that the mammoths had been deposited in the caves by the cats themselves and not by scavengers left the name homotherium ( greek : , 'same ' ) and , 'beast ' ) ) was proposed by emilio fabrini ( 1890 ) , without further explanation , for a new subgenus of machairodus , whose main distinguishing feature was the presence of a large diastema between the two inferior premolars thumb the unusually large , square nasal opening , similar to that of the cheetah ( acinonyx jubatus ) , presumably allowed faster oxygen intake , which would have aided in rapid or extended running and in cooling the brain the sloped back and powerful lumbar section of homotheriums vertebrae suggest a bear-like build , and thus that these animals could have been capable of pulling formidable loads ; further , broken upper canines - a common injury in fossils of other machairodonts such as machairodus and smilodon that would have resulted from struggling with their prey - is not seen in homotherium , perhaps because their social groups would completely restrain prey items before any of the cats attempted to kill the target with their saber teeth examination of the bones also indicates that the carcasses of these juvenile mammoths were dismembered after being killed by the cats before being dragged away , suggesting that homotherium would disarticulate their kill to transport it to a safe area such as a hidden lair or den and prevent competitors such as dire wolf and american lions from usurping the carcass . homotherium also seemed to have retained the excellent nocturnal vision typical of most cats , and hunting at night in the arctic regions where many homotherium have been found would have been a prime hunting method in the southern parts of its range the american homotherium co-existed with smilodon ; in the northern parts it was the only species of saber-toothed cat homotherium probably derived from machairodus and appeared for the first time at the mioceneâ€“pliocene border , about 4 to 5 million years ago the lineage of homotherium is estimated ( based on mitochondrial dna sequences ) to have diverged from that of smilodon about 18 million years ago despite homotheriums vast range and the large quantity of fossil remains from eurasia , africa and north america , complete skeletons of this cat are relatively rare again similarly to the cheetah , the visual cortex in homotheriums brain was large and complex , implying that the scimitar cat relied heavily on vision during the hunt
