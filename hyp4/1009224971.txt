the susa in susanoo 's name has been variously explained as being derived from either of the following words : the verb susabu or susamu meaning 'to be impetuous , ' 'to be violent , ' or 'to go wild ' the verb susumu 'to advance ' the township of susa ( 須佐郷 ) in iishi district , izumo province ( modern shimane prefecture ) a word related to middle korean susung meaning 'master ' or 'shaman ' 712 ce ) and the nihon shoki ( 720 ce ) both agree in their description of susanoo as the son of the god izanagi and the younger brother of amaterasu , the goddess of the sun , and of tsukuyomi , the god of the moon susanoo , announcing that he had won the trial as he had produced deities of the required gender , thus signifying the purity of his intentions , '' raged with victory '' and proceeded to wreak havoc by destroying his sister 's rice fields , defecating in her palace and flaying the 'heavenly piebald horse ' ( 天斑駒 , ame-no-fuchikoma ) , which he then hurled at amaterasu 's loom , killing one of her weaving maidens the deity in this story , mutō , is often conflated with gozu tennō ( who , as his name implies , was born with the head of an ox ) in later retellings , though one version identifies gozu tennō as mutō tenjin 's son the earliest known version of this legend , found in the fudoki of bingo province ( modern eastern hiroshima prefecture ) compiled during the nara period ( preserved in an extract quoted by scholar and shinto priest urabe kanekata in the shaku nihongi ) , has mutō explicitly identify himself as susanoo in the kojiki and the shoki he is portrayed first as a petulant young man , then as an unpredictable , violent boor who causes chaos and destruction before turning into a monster-slaying culture hero after descending into the world of men , while in the izumo fudoki , he is simply a local god apparently connected with rice fields , with almost none of the traits associated with him in the imperial mythologies being mentioned the edo period kokugaku scholar motoori norinaga , in his kojiki-den ( commentary on the kojiki ) , characterized susanoo as an evil god in contrast to his elder siblings amaterasu and tsukuyomi , as the unclean air of the land of the dead still adhered to izanagi 's nose from which he was born and was not purified completely during izanagi 's ritual ablutions the early 20th century historian : ja : 津田左右吉 , who put forward the then-controversial theory that the kojiki 's accounts were not based on history ( as edo period kokugaku and state shinto ideology believed them to be ) but rather propagandistic myths concocted to explain and legitimize the rule of the imperial ( yamato ) dynasty , also saw susanoo as a negative figure , arguing that he was created to serve as the rebellious opposite of the imperial ancestress amaterasu ethnologist : ja : 大林太良 , speaking from the standpoint of comparative mythology , opined that the stories concerning the three deities were ultimately derived from a continental ( southeast asian ) myth in which the sun , the moon and the dark star are siblings and the dark star plays an antagonistic role ( cf while the izumo fudoki claims that the township of susa in izumo is named after its deity susanoo , it has been proposed that the opposite might have actually been the case and susanoo was named after the place , with his name being understood in this case as meaning '' man ( o ) of susa unlike other scholars who connect susanoo with izumo , matsumae instead saw kii province ( the modern prefectures of wakayama and mie ) as the birthplace of susanoo worship , pointing out that there was also a settlement in kii named susa ( 須佐 ) indeed , some scholars have hypothesized that the deities who were eventually conflated with susanoo , mutō tenjin , and gozu tennō , may have had korean origins as well , with the name 'mutō ' ( 武塔 , historical orthography : mutau ) being linked with the korean word mudang '' shamaness , '' and 'gozu ' being explained as a calque of 'soshimori ' , here interpreted as being derived from a korean toponym meaning 'bull 's ( so ) head ( mari ) ' emilia gadeleva ( 2000 ) sees susanoo 's original character as being that of a rain god – more precisely , a god associated with rainmaking – with his association with the harvest and a number of other elements from his myths ultimately springing from his connection with rainwater gadeleva also acknowledges the foreign elements in the god 's character by supposing that rainmaking rituals and concepts were brought to japan in ancient times from the continent , with the figure of the korean shaman ( susung ) who magically controlled the abundance of rain eventually morphing into the japanese susanoo , but at the same time stresses that susanoo is not completely a foreign import but must have had japanese roots at his core while sometimes seemingly considered to be more or less identical to yomi , the land of the dead ( the kojiki speaks of ne-no-kuni as the land of susanoo 's deceased mother izanami , who is stated earlier in the narrative to have become the ruler of yomi , and calls the slope serving at its exit the yomotsu hirasaka , the 'flat slope of yomi ' ) , it would seem that the two were originally considered to be different locations while matsumura takeo suggested that ne-no-kuni originally referred to the dimly remembered original homeland of the japanese people , emilia gadeleva instead proposes that the two locales , while similar in that both were subterranean realms associated with darkness , differed from each other in that yomi was associated with death , while ne-no-kuni , as implied by the myth about ōnamuji , was seemingly associated with rebirth ne-no-kuni being a land of revival , as per gadeleva 's theory , is why susanoo was connected to it : susanoo , as the god that brought rain and with it , the harvest , was needed in ne-no-kuni to secure the rebirth of crops emilia gadeleva observes that susanoo , at this point in the narrative , is portrayed similarly to the hero yamato takeru ( ousu-no-mikoto ) , in that both were rough young men possessed with '' valor and ferocity '' ( takeku-araki kokoro ) ; their lack of control over their fierce temperament leads them to commit violent acts a prayer or norito originally recited by the priestly nakatomi clan in the presence of the court during the great exorcism ( 大祓 , ōharae ) ritual of the last day of the sixth month , more commonly known today as the ōharae no kotoba ( 大祓詞 , 'words of the great exorcism ' ) , lists eight '' heavenly sins '' ( japanese : 天つ罪 , tsumi ) , most of which are agricultural in nature : breaking down the ridges covering up the ditches releasing the irrigation sluices double planting setting up stakes skinning alive skinning backward defecation 1 , 2 , 6 , 7 and 8 are committed by susanoo in the kojiki , while 3 , 4 , 5 are attributed to him in the shoki another tradition which reads the passage as '' cutting off his beard and the nails of his hands and feet , had him exorcised '' ( 亦切鬚及手足爪令祓而 ) meanwhile suggests that this was an act of purification , in which the sins and pollution that adhered to susanoo are removed , thus turning him from a destroyer of life into a giver of life susanoo 's consorts are : kushinadahime ( 櫛名田比売 ) , daughter of ashinazuchi and tenazuchi , children of kamiumi , a son of izanagi and elder brother of susanoo ( kojiki , nihon shoki ) : also known under the following names : : kushiinadahime ( 奇稲田姫 , nihon shoki ) : inadahime (
