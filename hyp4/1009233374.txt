the lappet-faced vulture is a huge species , ranking as the longest and largest winged vulture in its range , behind the closely related cinereous vulture , although some co-occurring gyps vultures tend to be heavier on average , especially the cape vulture and eurasian griffon the bill , at up to long and deep , ranks as one of the largest of any accipitrid , although a reported culmen length of is slightly less than the culmen length of the cinereous vulture birdlife species factsheet lappet-faced vulture – species text in the atlas of southern african birds arkive – images and movies of the lappet-faced vulture ( torgos tracheliotos ) the declines are almost entirely due to human activities , including disturbances from habitat destruction and cultivation , disturbances at the nesting site ( to which the species is reportedly quite sensitive ) and ingestion of pesticides , which are usually set out for jackals and other small mammalian carnivores they are the most powerful and aggressive of the african vultures , and other vultures will usually cede a carcass to the lappet-faced vulture if it decides to assert itself however , lappet-faced vultures frequently hang around the edges of the throngs at large carcasses , waiting until the other vultures are done , to feed on remnant skin , tendons and other coarse tissues that the others will not eat the lappet-faced vulture breeds in senegal , mali , mauritania , burkina faso , niger , chad , sudan , egypt , ethiopia , somalia , kenya , tanzania , uganda , rwanda , the democratic republic of the congo , zambia , malawi , mozambique , swaziland , south africa , zimbabwe , botswana and namibia this species is patchily distributed through much of africa , though it is absent from much of the central and western parts of the continent and declining elsewhere in its range domestic cattle , who have replaced natural prey over much of the range , are now often sold off , rather than abandoned , due to the proliferation of markets and abattoirs and rarely left to die and be consumed by vultures on 20 june 2019 , the carcasses of 468 white-backed vultures , 17 white-headed vultures , 28 hooded vultures , 14 lappet-faced vultures and 10 cape vultures , altogether 537 vultures , besides 2 tawny eagles , were found in northern botswana the head coloration can range from reddish in southern africa to dull pink in more northern africa to pink on the back of the head and gray on the front in the arabian peninsula this is often beneficial to the less powerful vultures because the lappet-face can tear through the tough hides and knotty muscles of large mammals that the others can not penetrate , although hyenas are even more efficient in this regard ( if more voracious eaters )
