the knee is a modified hinge joint , a type of synovial joint , which is composed of three functional compartments : the patellofemoral articulation , consisting of the patella , or '' kneecap '' , and the patellar groove on the front of the femur through which it slides ; and the medial and lateral tibiofemoral articulations linking the femur , or thigh bone , with the tibia , the main bone of the lower leg the knee permits flexion and extension about a virtual transverse axis , as well as a slight medial and lateral rotation about the axis of the lower leg in the flexed position in humans , the term '' knee '' refers to the joints between the femur , tibia , and patella , in the leg in quadrupeds such as dogs , horses , and mice , the homologous joints between the femur , tibia , and patella , in the hind leg , are known as the stifle joint there are two disorders relating to an abnormal angle in the coronal plane at the level of the knee : genu valgum is a valgus deformity in which the tibia is turned outward in relation to the femur , resulting in a knock-kneed appearance the final rotation is produced by a lateral rotation of the tibia in the non-weight-bearing leg , and by a medial rotation of the femur in the weight-bearing leg in birds , the '' knee '' refers to the joints between the femur and tibiotarsus , and also the patella ( when present ) anteriorly , the synovial membrane is attached on the margin of the cartilage both on the femur and the tibia , but on the femur , the suprapatellar bursa or recess extends the joint space proximally also in quadrupeds , particularly horses , ungulates , and elephants , the layman 's term '' knee '' also commonly refers to the forward-facing joint in the foreleg , the carpus , which is homologous to the human wrist the layman 's term '' knee '' may also refer to the ( lower and often more visible due to not being covered by feathers ) joint between the tibiotarsus and tarsometatarsus , which is homologous to the human ankle one form of patellofemoral syndrome involves a tissue-related problem that creates pressure and irritation in the knee between the patella and the trochlea ( patellar compression syndrome ) , which causes pain it is also occasionally called the patellar tendon because there is no definite separation between the quadriceps tendon ( which surrounds the patella ) and the area connecting the patella to the tibia the resulting series of transverse axes permit the sliding and rolling motion in the flexing knee while ensuring the collateral ligaments are sufficiently lax to permit the rotation associated with the curvature of the medial condyle about a vertical axis the second major class of knee disorder involves a tear , slippage , or dislocation that impairs the structural ability of the knee to balance the leg ( patellofemoral instability syndrome ) the knee is the largest joint and one of the most important joints in the body with the knee extended both the lateral and medial collateral ligaments , as well as the anterior part of the anterior cruciate ligament , are taut the two exceptions to this is gracilis , a flexor , which belongs to the medial compartment and sartorius , a flexor , in the anterior compartment this center moves upward and backward during flexion , while the distance between the center and the articular surfaces of the femur changes dynamically with the decreasing curvature of the femoral condyles this terminal rotation is made possible by the shape of the medial femoral condyle , assisted by contraction of the popliteus muscle and the iliotibial tract and is caused by the stretching of the anterior cruciate ligament it protects the medial side of the knee from being bent open by a stress applied to the lateral side of the knee ( a valgus force ) the arcuate popliteal ligament originates on the apex of the head of the fibula to stretch proximally , crosses the tendon of the popliteus muscle , and passes into the capsule the knee joint is called '' mobile '' because the femur and lateral meniscus move over the tibia during rotation , while the femur rolls and glides over both menisci during extension-flexion it is composed of three groups of fibers , one stretching between the two bones , and two fused with the medial meniscus genu varum is a varus deformity in which the tibia is turned inward in relation to the femur , resulting in a bowlegged deformity the oblique popliteal ligament is a radiation of the tendon of the semimembranosus on the medial side , from where it is direct laterally and proximally on its posterior surface is a lateral and a medial articular surface , both of which communicate with the patellar surface which unites the two femoral condyles on the anterior side of the bone 's distal end at birth , the patella is just formed from cartilage , and this will ossify ( change to bone ) between the ages of three and five years between these two extensions , the synovial membrane passes in front of the two cruciate ligaments at the center of the joint , thus forming a pocket direct inward there are two menisci in the knee , the medial ( inner ) and the lateral ( outer ) the degree of varus or valgus deformity can be quantified by the hip-knee-ankle angle , which is an angle between the femoral mechanical axis and the center of the ankle joint the patella also serves an articular body , and its posterior surface is referred to as the trochlea of the knee because of the oblique position of the cruciate ligaments at least a part of one of them is always tense and these ligaments control the joint as the collateral ligaments are relaxed the muscles responsible for the movement of the knee joint belong to either the anterior , medial or posterior compartment of the thigh it plays an essential role in movement related to carrying the body weight in horizontal ( running and walking ) and vertical ( jumping ) directions the menisci are flattened at the center of the knee joint , fused with the synovial membrane laterally , and can move over the tibial surface
