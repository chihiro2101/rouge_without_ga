dan dare appeared on the cover of the first issue of the weekly comic strip magazine , eagle , on 14 april 1950 occasionally , eagle incorporated '' centrefolds '' of the fictional spaceships , such as dan 's ship the anastasia , reminiscent of cutaway drawings of aircraft in aviation magazines or even in eagle itself the stories were set mostly on planets of the solar system presumed to have extraterrestrial life and alien inhabitants , common in science fiction before space probes of the 1960s proved the most likely worlds were lifeless the first occurred after two episodes of '' marooned on mercury '' ( 1952 ) , which was taken over by harold johns , from scripts by samaritans founder and clergyman rev hampson returned to start the following story , '' operation saturn '' ( 1953 ) , but suffered a relapse after 20 weeks principal art was taken over by new chief assistant don harley , who completed the story and its successor , '' prisoners of space '' ( the only series to feature extensive work by an artist outside the studio , finishes being provided by desmond walduck hampson returned full-time in 1955 , starting '' the man from nowhere '' trilogy , which took dan and his companions outside the solar system for the first time production fell to frank bellamy , whose modern three-dimensional style contrasted with hampson 's , despite efforts to smooth the transition by alternating the two pages of the weekly strip between bellamy and the team of don harley and keith watson , and freelance artist bruce cornwell dan dare was surrounded by a varying cast , initially : dan dare ( full name colonel daniel mcgregor dare ) was chief pilot of the interplanet space fleet in 1960 artwork was taken over by frank bellamy , don harley , keith watson , gerald palmer , with bruce cornwell , and the look changed , with the colourful , rounded rocket ships replaced by angular silver craft , and changes to the space suits and insignia in 1962 the strip was removed from the front to the inside of the comic , in black and white , and was drawn by keith watson over the remaining years the strip varied in format and quality , eventually returning to the front page in colour , until it ended in 1967 with dan retiring to become space fleet controller list of dan dare stories in 2000ad at 2000ad.org the first instalment , scripted by ken armstrong and pat mills , had the character revived from suspended animation after two hundred years to find himself in a different world the mekon had also survived but otherwise the cast was different , as was the tone of the strip ( heavily influenced by the punk movement , as was much of 2000 ad ) and the personality of the title character after 23 issues in this format the strip took a break for a month and then returned in a revamped format with a more realistic style , written by gerry finley-day and jack adrian ( chris lowder ) and illustrated by dave gibbons this story arc concluded with the pair escaping the earth authorities and going on the run to try to clear their names by tracking down the mekon and recovering the crystal , establishing the format for the next story arc despite promises that dare and sondar would be back , the 2000 ad dan dare strip '' attack on eternium '' ended here in prog 126 ( 18 august 1979 ) in 1997 , to celebrate their 20th anniversary , 2000 ad published two issues with additional free comics , the first a reprint of the first issue of 2000 ad , which starred dan dare the initial artist was gerry embleton , who drew dan to resemble the original exactly , but he was quickly replaced by ian kennedy , who gave the hero a younger look and blond hair one controversial aspect of the strip was a lengthy flashback which retconned the original dan to be a veteran of the second world war and to have travelled through time to the era in which his adventures in the original eagle took place—an attempt to explain why a hero in the age of space travel had a 1950s outlook on life after this initial storyline other writers were used and different supporting characters came and went , including professor pinkerton , a female scientist similar to professor peabody , and a new digby ( again , a descendant of the original ) the original strip , featuring the original characters of the 1950s eagle , was revived in 1989 , with artist keith watson providing the artwork for the initial run of stories watson had been part of the dan dare team from 1958 to 1960 and was sole artist on dan dare from 1962 to 1967 it presented bleak and cynical characters and was a not-too-subtle satire of 1980s british politics , from the perspective of the defeated left wing of the labour party spacefleet had been privatised , the treens were subjected to racist abuse in urban ghettos , digby was unemployed , professor peabody committed suicide , and dare 's mentor sir hubert guest betrayed dare to the mekon and his quisling british prime minister , gloria monday ( whose appearance and demeanour appear modelled on margaret thatcher ) inside was a new and unfinished dan dare story , '' remembrance '' , drawn by sydney jordan featuring a slightly older dare and apparently set some years after the original eagle strips in 2007–2008 virgin comics published a 7 issue dan dare mini-series written by garth ennis , with art by gary erskine launched in october 2003 , spaceship away magazine was originally created in order to get '' the phoenix mission '' ( a 1950s style story by rod barzilay with art by keith watson and don harley ) into publication , with the agreement of the dan dare corporation response was good enough to warrant the magazine 's continuation following that strip 's conclusion , initially with '' green nemesis '' ( again by barzilay and don harley , with later chapters drawn by david pugh and tim booth image : dandare.jpg thumb this ad for the dan dare pilot of the future serial appeared in the 208 magazine in march 1952 the new
