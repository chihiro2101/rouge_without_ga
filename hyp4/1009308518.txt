in some barnacles , the cement glands are fixed to a long , muscular stalk , but in most they are part of a flat membrane or calcified plate the eight pairs of thoracic limbs are referred to as '' cirre '' , which are feathery and very long , being used to filter food , such as plankton , from the water and move it towards the mouth indeed , the word '' barnacle '' originally referred to a species of goose , the barnacle goose branta leucopsis , whose eggs and young were rarely seen by humans because it breeds in the remote arctic although they have been found at water depths to , most barnacles inhabit shallow waters , with 75 % of species living in water depths less than , and 25 % inhabiting the intertidal zone for example , members of the superorder rhizocephala , including the genus sacculina , are parasitic and live within crabs the most common , '' acorn barnacles '' ( sessilia ) , are sessile , growing their shells directly onto the substrate barnacles were originally classified by linnaeus and cuvier as mollusca , but in 1830 john vaughan thompson published observations showing the metamorphosis of the nauplius and cypris larvae into adult barnacles , and noted how these larvae were similar to those of crustaceans the degree of disarticluation of fossils suggests the distance they have been transported , and since many species have narrow ranges of water depths , it can be assumed that the animals lived in shallow water and broke up as they were washed down-slope in the swamping strategy , vast numbers of barnacles settle in the same place at once , covering a large patch of substrate , allowing at least some to survive in the balance of probabilities '' oxford english dictionary , 2nd edition , 1989 additionally , the picoroco barnacle is used in chilean cuisine and is one of the ingredients in curanto balanoids gained their advantage over the chthalamoids in the oligocene , when they evolved tubular skeletons , which provide better anchorage to the substrate , and allow them to grow faster , undercutting , crushing , and smothering chthalamoids larvae assess surfaces based upon their surface texture , chemistry , relative wettability , color , and the presence or absence and composition of a surface biofilm ; swarming species are also more likely to attach near other barnacles the resemblance of this barnacle 's fleshy stalk to a goose 's neck gave rise , in ancient times , to the notion that geese literally grew from the barnacle fast growth allows the suspension feeders to access higher levels of the water column than their competitors , and to be large enough to resist displacement ; species employing this response , such as the aptly named megabalanus , can reach in length ; other species may grow larger still ( austromegabalanus psittacus ) the ovaries are located in the base or stalk , and may extend into the mantle , while the testes are towards the back of the head , often extending into the thorax free-living barnacles are attached to the substratum by cement glands that form the base of the first pair of antennae ; in effect , the animal is fixed upside down by means of its forehead in sessile barnacles , the apex of the ring of plates is covered by an operculum , which may be recessed into the carapace for the rest of their lives , they are cemented to the substrate , using their feathery legs ( cirri ) to capture plankton ( 2020 ) provide a simplified approach for estimating the effect of real barnacle settlement in nature on the resistance and effective power of the ship these photoreceptors record the stimulus for the barnacle shadow reflex , where a sudden decrease in light causes cessation of the fishing rhythm and closing of the opercular plates
