baltimore served as the director of the whitehead institute until july 1 , 1990 , when he was appointed the sixth president of rockefeller university in new york city under baltimore 's leadership , a distinguished group of founding members including gerald fink , rudolf jaenisch , harvey lodish , and robert weinberg was assembled and eventually grew to 20 members in disciplines ranging from immunology , genetics , and oncology to fundamental developmental studies in mice and fruit flies he also continued to pursue fundamental questions in rna viruses and in 1981 , baltimore and vincent racaniello , a post-doctoral fellow in his laboratory , used recombinant dna technology to generate a plasmid encoding the genome of poliovirus , an animal rna virus '' but she was also committed to her family and to my father 's right to have his religion , and we celebrated the major holidays , we fasted on yom kippur , and i walked with my father to the shul , which was a long walk from where we lived less than a decade after its founding with continued leadership by baltimore , the whitehead institute was named the top research institution in the world in molecular biology and genetics , and over a recent 10-year period , papers published by whitehead scientists were the most cited papers of any biological research institute in october 2005 , baltimore resigned the office of the president of caltech , saying , '' this is not a decision that i have made easily , but i am convinced that the interests of the institute will be best served by a presidential transition at this particular time in its history he was elected to the national academy of sciences usa ( nas ) in1974 ; the american academy of arts and sciences , 1974 ; the nas institute of medicine ( iom ) , 1974 ; the american association of immunologists , 1984 warren alpert foundation prize ( 2000 ) national medal of science ( 1999 ) golden plate award of the academy of achievement ( 1986 ) embo member ( 1983 ) nobel prize in physiology or medicine ( 1975 ) fellow of the american academy of arts and sciences ( 1974 ) nas award in molecular biology ( 1974 ) canada gairdner international award ( 1974 ) gustav stern award in virology ( 1971 ) warren triennial prize ( 1971 ) eli lilly award in immunology and microbiology ( 1971 ) also in 1973 , he became one of the early faculty members in the newly organized mit center for cancer ( ccr ) , capping a creative and industrious period of his career with nearly fifty research publications including the paradigm-shifting paper on reverse transcriptase baltimore also serves on the jackson laboratory 's board of trustees , the bulletin of the atomic scientists ' board of sponsors , amgen , inc during baltimore 's tenure at caltech , united states president bill clinton awarded baltimore the national medal of science in 1999 for his numerous contributions to the scientific world he was elected a list of fellows of the royal society elected in 1987 ; the french academy of sciences , 2000 ; and the american association for cancer research ( aacr ) '' as early as 1984 , rudolf grosschedl and david weaver , postdoctoral fellows , in baltimore 's laboratory , were experimenting with the creation of transgenic mice as a model for the study of disease '' at the time , baltimore 's greatest contribution to virology was his discovery of reverse transcriptase ( rtase or rt ) which is essential for the reproduction of retroviruses such as hiv and was discovered independently , and at about the same time , by satoshi mizutani and temin this was a key discovery in determining how the immune system can have specificity for a given molecule out of many possibilities , and was considered by baltimore as of 2005 to be '' our most significant discovery in immunology '' in addition to his influence on public policy for recombinant dna research , baltimore has influenced national policy concerning the aids epidemic in 2006 baltimore was elected to a three-year term as president of the american association for the advancement of science ( aaas ) baltimore served as director of the wibr and expanded the faculty and research areas into key areas of research including mouse and drosophila genetics wolff were invited by the national academy of sciences and the institute of medicine to coauthor an independent report : confronting aids ( 1986 ) , in which they called for a 1 billion research program for hiv/aids the conference discussed possible dangers of new biotechnology , drew up voluntary safety guidelines , and issued a call for an ongoing moratorium on certain types of experiments and review of possible experiments , which has been institutionalized by recombinant dna advisory committees established at essentially all us academic institutions conducting molecular biology research he took the cold spring harbor course on animal virology in 1961 and he moved to richard franklin 's lab at the rockefeller institute at new york city which was one of the few labs pioneering molecular research on animal virology reminiscent of the asilomar conference on recombinant dna in 1975 , those involved want both scientists and the public to be more aware of the ethical issues and risks involved with new techniques for genome modification nobel prize video interview '' the discover magazine interview with david baltimore '' upon his retirement from the presidency of caltech in 2006 pbs interview with baltimore on aids , hepatitis , vaccines and science politics during the late 1980s and early 1990s , thereza imanishi-kari , a scientist who was not in baltimore 's laboratory but in a separate , independent laboratory at mit , was implicated in a case of scientific fraud after winning the nobel prize , baltimore reorganized his laboratory , refocusing on immunology and virology , with immunoglobulin gene expression as a major area of interest baltimore 's future promise was evident in his work as a graduate student when he entered mit 's graduate program in biology in 1960 with a brash and brilliant approach to learning science , completing his phd thesis work in 2 years in 1986 , while a professor of biology at mit and director at whitehead , baltimore co-authored a scientific paper on immunology with thereza imanishi-kari ( an assistant professor of biology who had her own laboratory at mit ) as well as four others luria and quickly achieved pre-eminence with a remarkable group of faculty including baltimore , phillips robbins , herman eisen , philip sharp , and robert weinberg , who all went on to illustrious research careers gallo 's nih lab ) around october 1989 , when baltimore was appointed president of rockefeller university , around a third of the faculty opposed his appointment because of concerns about his behaviour in the imanishi-kari case baltimore is a member of the usa science and engineering festival 's advisory board and an xconomist ( an editorial advisor for the tech news and media company , xconomy ) in 1980 , his group isolated the oncogene in amulv and showed it was a member of a new class of protein kinases that used the amino acid tyrosine as a phosphoacceptor schatz and marjorie oettinger , as students in baltimore 's research group in 1988 and 1989 , identified the protein pair that rearranges immunoglobulin genes , the recombination-activating gene rag-1 and rag-2 he was introduced to molecular biology by george streisinger under whose mentorship he worked for a summer at cold spring harbor laboratory as part of the inaugural cohort of the undergraduate research program in 1959 a key step enabling researchers to slice up any dna sequence they choose was developed by emmanuelle charpentier , then at umea university in sweden , and jennifer doudna of the university of california , berkeley in a draft report dated march 14 , 1991 and based mainly on usss forensics findings , nih 's fraud unit , then called the office of scientific integrity ( osi ) , accused imanishi-kari of falsifying and fabricating data raised in the queens neighborhoods of forest hills and rego park , queens , he moved with his family to suburban great neck , new york while he was in second grade because his mother felt that the city schools were inadequate baltimore was appointed president emeritus and the robert andrews milikan professor of biology at caltech and has remained as an active member of the institute 's community in 1972 , at the age of 34 , baltimore was awarded tenure as a professor of biology at mit , a post that he held until 1997 the whitehead institute has been rated as doing '' world leading research in genetics and molecular biology '' , and was an important partner in the human genome project in 2003 , as a postdoctoral fellow in david baltimore 's lab at caltech , matthew porteus was the first to demonstrate precise gene editing in human cells using chimeric nucleases '' fraud in nih grant programs , ''
