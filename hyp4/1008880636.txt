e.g the lieutenant governor must however refer any bill impacting on reserved powers ( defence , foreign relations , nationality law , the relationship between the island and the united kingdom and any matters relating to the monarch ) to the british government for advice , on which he is required to act church ( application of general synod measures ) act 1979 before 1994 , the equivalent of the royal assent was granted by order in council , as for a bill , but the power to grant the equivalent of the royal assent to measures has now been delegated to the lieutenant governor in commonwealth realms other than the uk , royal assent is granted or withheld either by the realm 's sovereign or , more frequently , by the representative of the sovereign , the governor-general however , though both houses must be notified on the same day , notice to the house of commons while it is not in session may be given by way of publishing a special issue of the journals of the house of commons , whereas the senate must be sitting and the governor general 's letter read aloud by the speaker while royal assent has not been withheld for a bill backed by the government in the united kingdom since 1708 , it has often been withheld in british colonies and former colonies by governors acting on royal instructions in the united states declaration of independence , colonists complained that george iii '' has refused his assent to laws , the most wholesome and necessary for the public good and has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate and pressing importance , unless suspended in their operation till his assent should be obtained ; and when so suspended , he has utterly neglected to attend to them since the balfour declaration of 1926 and the statute of westminster 1931 , all the commonwealth realms have been sovereign kingdoms , the monarch and governors-general acting solely on the advice of the local ministers , who generally maintain the support of the legislature and are the ones who secure the passage of bills in the united kingdom , a bill is presented for royal assent after it has passed all the required stages in both the house of commons and the house of lords under the parliament acts 1911 and 1949 , the house of commons may , under certain circumstances , direct that a bill be presented for assent despite lack of passage by the house of lords '' once a bill has completed all the parliamentary stages in both houses , it is ready to receive royal assent '' , bill becomes an act of parliament a list of all bills that have thus passed parliament is drawn up by the clerk of the crown in chancery ;

the senior commissioner then states , '' my lords , in obedience to her majesty 's commands , and by virtue of the commission which has been now read , we do declare and notify to you , the lords spiritual and temporal and commons in parliament assembled , that her majesty has given her royal assent to the several acts in the commission mentioned anson 's law and custom of the constitution , 5th ed , 1922 , vol 1 , page 338 during the 1960s , the ceremony of assenting by commission was discontinued and is now only employed once a year , at the end of the annual parliamentary session as the attorney-general explained , '' there has been a good deal of resentment not only at the loss of parliamentary time that has been involved but at the breaking of the thread of a possibly eloquent speech and the disruption of a debate that may be caused '' hansard , 7 april 1967 , house of commons , columns 7–25 under the royal assent act 1967 , royal assent can be granted by the sovereign in writing , by means of letters patent , that are presented to the presiding officer of each house of parliament thus , unlike the granting of royal assent by the monarch in person or by royal commissioners , the method created by the royal assent act 1967 does not require both houses to meet jointly for the purpose of receiving the notice of royal assent in practice this remains the standard method , a fact that is belied by the wording of the letters patent for the appointment of the royal commissioners and by the wording of the letters patent for the granting of royal assent in writing under the 1967 act ( '' independently of the method used to signify royal assent , it is the responsibility of the clerk of the parliaments , once the assent has been duly notified to both houses , not only to endorse the act in the name of the monarch with the formal norman french formula , but to certify that assent has been granted the clerk signs one authentic copy of the bill and inserts the date ( in english ) on which the assent was notified to the two houses after the title of the act the governor-general then signs the bill , and notifies the president of the senate and the speaker of the house of representatives , who in turn notify their respective houses of the governor-general 's action one result , conceived as part of a string of acts intended to demonstrate canada 's status as an independent realm , was that king george vi personally assented to nine bills of the canadian parliament during his 1939 tour of canada—85 years after his great-grandmother , queen victoria , had last granted royal assent personally in the united kingdom under the royal assent act 2002 , however , the alternative practice of granting assent in writing , with each house being notified separately ( the speaker of the senate or a representative reads to the senators the letters from the governor general regarding the written declaration of royal assent ) , was brought into force as the act also provides , royal assent is to be signified—by the governor general , or , more often , by a deputy , usually a justice of the supreme court the usher of the black rod is then commanded by the speaker to summon the members of parliament , who follow black rod back to the senate , the sergeant-at-arms carrying the mace of the house of commons in the senate , those from the commons stand behind the bar , while black rod proceeds to stand next to the governor general , who then nods his or her head to signify royal assent to the presented bills ( which do not include supply bills ) retrieved 23 january 2021 if there are any supply bills to receive royal assent , the speaker of the house of commons will read their titles and the senate clerk repeats them to the governor general , who nods his or her head to communicate royal assent in both cases , however , the process of assent and promulgation is usually a formality , whether by constitutional convention or by an explicit provision of the constitution in accordance with the belgian constitution , upon the declaration of the sovereign 's incapacity , the council of ministers assumed the powers of the head of state until parliament could rule on the king 's incapacity and appoint a regent article 93 of that document gives the jordanian sovereign six months to sign or veto any legislation sent to him from the national assembly ; if he vetoes it within that timeframe , the assembly may override his veto by a two-thirds vote of both houses ; otherwise , the law does not go into effect ( but it may be reconsidered in the next session of the assembly ) while article 34 of the constitution of luxembourg formerly required the grand duke or duchess to sanction and promulgate a new law for it to take effect , the required sanction was removed in 2008 , after grand duke henri informed his prime minister that he could not in good conscience assent to a bill to permit euthanasia in the country should the monarch ever choose to exercise this privilege , article 79 provides a means by which his veto may be over-ridden : '' if a bill has been passed unaltered by two sessions of the storting , constituted after two separate successive elections and separated from each other by at least two intervening sessions of the storting , without a divergent bill having been passed by any storting in the period between the first and last adoption , and it is then submitted to the king with a petition that his majesty shall not refuse his assent to a bill which , after the most mature deliberation , the storting considers to be beneficial , it shall become law even if the royal assent is not accorded before the storting goes into recess article 92 invests the monarch with the right to call for a referendum , on the advice of the prime minister of spain ( commonly referred to in english as the prime minister ) and the authorisation of the cortes
