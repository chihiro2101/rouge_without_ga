the blackcurrant requires a number of essential nutrients to be present to enable it to thrive ; nitrogen provides strong plant growth and stimulates the production of flower sprigs ; phosphorus aids growth , the setting of fruit and crop yield ; potassium promotes growth of individual shoots and increases the weight of individual fruits ; magnesium is a constituent of chlorophyll and helps increase yields through interaction with potassium ; calcium is required for cell division and enlargement and is particularly important for young plants and buds in britain , 95 % of the blackcurrants grown are used to manufacture ribena ( a brand of fruit juice whose name is derived from ribes nigrum ) and similar fruit syrups and juices since blackcurrant berries are a rich source of the vitamin , and blackcurrant plants are suitable for growing in the uk climate , the british government encouraged their cultivation and soon the yield of the nation 's crop increased significantly the purée can be used to make blackcurrant preserves and be included in cheesecakes , yogurt , ice cream , desserts , sorbets , and many other sweet dishes planting is usually done in the autumn or winter to allow the plants to become established before growth starts in the spring , but container-grown stock can be planted at any time of year macerated blackcurrants are also the primary ingredient in the apéritif , crème de cassis , which in turn is added to white wine to produce a kir or to champagne to make a kir royal since the american federal ban curtailed currant production nationally for nearly a century , the fruit remains largely unknown in the united states , and has yet to regain its previous popularity to levels enjoyed in europe or new zealand in warm weather this takes about 48 hours but in cold weather it may take a week , and by that time , the ovule may have passed the stage where it is receptive blackcurrants were once popular in the united states as well , but became less common in the 20th century after currant farming was banned in the early 1900s , when blackcurrants , as a vector of cronartium ribicola , were considered a threat to the u.s for culinary use , the fruit is usually cooked with sugar to produce a purée , which can then be passed through muslin to separate the juice although the bushes are winter hardy , frosts during the flowering period may adversely affect the yield and cold winds may restrict the number of flying insects visiting and pollinating the flowers in poland , the research institute of horticulture has done work on improving the blackcurrant with regard to disease and pest resistance , fruit quality , adaptations to local conditions and mechanical harvesting in midsummer the strigs of green fruit ripen to edible berries , very dark purple in colour , almost black , with glossy skins and persistent calyxes at the apex , each containing many seeds owing to its unique flavour and richness in polyphenols , dietary fiber and essential nutrients , awareness and popularity of blackcurrant is once again growing , with a number of consumer products entering the u.s japan imports us 3.6 & nbsp ; million of new zealand blackcurrants for uses as dietary supplements , snacks , functional food products and as quick-frozen ( iqf ) produce for culinary production as jams , jellies or preserves on a garden scale the plants can be set at intervals of or they can be set in rows with planting intervals of and row separations of or more currant and gooseberry leaf spot ( drepanopeziza ribis ) is another disease of blackcurrants , but it is not usually a serious problem as most cultivars now have some resistance the effectiveness of these restrictions is questionable , since other ribes species also host the disease , some are native to north america , and others such as red currants and ribes uva-crispa were never banned as a result , the blackcurrant was banned in the united states as a disease vector for much of the 20th century , and even after the federal ban was lifted in 1966 , several u.s back-crossing these varieties to a parent have produced new strains such as 'titania ' that have a higher yield , better disease resistance , are more tolerant of adverse weather conditions and are suitable for machine harvesting since 1991 , new zealand has become an important centre for research and development , as its temperate climate is particularly suitable for cultivation of the crop the exceptionally strong flavour can be moderated by combining it with other fruits , such as raspberries and strawberries in summer pudding , or apples in crumbles and pies the leaves can be extracted to yield a yellow dye , and the fruit is a source for a blue or violet dye resulting from its rich content of anthocyanins during the 20th century in europe , much hybridisation work has been carried out in order to reduce the plant 's susceptibility to disease and frost and also to increase yields in russia , blackcurrant leaves may be used for flavoring tea or preserves , such as salted cucumbers , and berries for home winemaking and new varieties are being developed continually to improve frost tolerance , disease resistance , machine harvesting , fruit quality , nutritional content and fruit flavour in the united kingdom , a blackcurrant cordial may be mixed with cider ( hard cider ) to make a drink called '' cider and black '' varieties producing green fruit , less strongly-flavoured and sweeter than typical blackcurrants , are cultivated in finland , where they are called '' greencurrants '' ( viherherukka ) as of 2017 , major cultivation efforts to improve fruit characteristics occurred in scotland , new zealand , and poland the blackcurrant leaf midge can cause browning , crimping and distortion of leaves at the tips of shoots but it is seldom a serious problem
