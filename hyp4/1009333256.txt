x-ray absorption spectroscopy ( xas ) studies of canavalia ensiformis ( jack bean ) , klebsiella aerogenes and sporosarcina pasteurii ( formerly known as bacillus pasteurii ) confirm 5–6 coordinate nickel ions with exclusively o/n ligation , including two imidazole ligands per nickel cysteine residues are common in the flap region of the enzymes , which have been determined not to be essential in catalysis , although involved in positioning other key residues in the active site appropriately when compared , the α subunits of helicobacter pylori urease and other bacterial ureases align with the jack bean ureases a lone pair of electrons from one of the nitrogen atoms on the urea molecule creates a double bond with the central carbon , and the resulting nh 2 − of the coordinated substrate interacts with a nearby positively charged group the mechanism proposed by hausinger and karplus attempts to revise some of the issues apparent in the blakely and zerner pathway , and focuses on the positions of the side chains making up the urea-binding pocket aerogenes urease , it was argued that the general base used in the blakely mechanism , his 320 , was too far away from the ni2-bound water to deprotonate in order to form the attacking hydroxide moiety the mechanism follows the same path , with the general base omitted ( as there is no more need for it ) and his 320 donating its proton to form the ammonia molecule , which is then released from the enzyme while the majority of the his 320 ligands and bound water will not be in their active forms ( protonated and deprotonated , respectively , ) it was calculated that approximately 0.3 % of total urease enzyme would be active at any one time while logically , this would imply that the enzyme is not very efficient , contrary to established knowledge , usage of the reverse protonation scheme provides an advantage in increased reactivity for the active form , balancing out the disadvantage as this histidine ligand is part of the mobile flap , binding of the urea substrate for catalysis closes this flap over the active site and with the addition of the hydrogen bonding pattern to urea from other ligands in the pocket , speaks to the selectivity of the urease enzyme for urea the mechanism proposed by ciurli and mangani is one of the more recent and currently accepted views of the mechanism of urease and is based primarily on the different roles of the two nickel ions in the active site with regards to this proposal , urea enters the active site cavity when the mobile ‘ flap ’ ( which allows for the entrance of urea into the active site ) is open stability of the binding of urea to the active site is achieved via a hydrogen-bonding network , orienting the substrate into the catalytic cavity therefore , in this proposed mechanism , the positioning of urea in the active site is induced by the structural features of the active site residues which are positioned to act as hydrogen-bond donors in the vicinity of ni1 and as acceptors in the vicinity of ni2 the main structural difference between the ciurli/mangani mechanism and the other two is that it incorporates a nitrogen , oxygen bridging urea that is attacked by a bridging hydroxide in the stomach there is an increase in ph of the mucosal lining as a result of urea hydrolysis , which prevents movement of hydrogen ions between gastric glands and gastric lumen in the absence of plants , urease activity in soil is generally attributed to heterotrophic microorganisms , although it has been demonstrated that some chemoautotrophic ammonium oxidizing bacteria are capable of growth on urea as a sole source of carbon , nitrogen , and energy
