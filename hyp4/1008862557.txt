endeavour was originally the merchant collier earl of pembroke , built by thomas fishburn for thomas millner , launched in june 1764 from the coal and whaling port of whitby in north yorkshire 33–41 there is uncertainty about the height of her standing masts ( excludes top and gallant masts national maritime museum greenwich endeavour 1771 draught zaz6595 ) , as surviving diagrams of endeavour depict the body of the vessel only , and not the mast plan while her main and foremast standing spars ( excludes top and gallant masts ) are accepted to be a standard ( standards differed from shipyard to shipyard and country to country ) , respectively from an annotation on one surviving ship plan national maritime museum in greenwich nmm zaz6594 , which records these lengths has the mizzen as '' 16 & nbsp ; yards 29 & nbsp ; inches '' & nbsp ; m ) sutherland , rushton , cooper 1711 davis and edson 1985 late 20th-century research suggested the annotation may be a transcription error with '' 19 & nbsp ; yards & nbsp ; 29 inches '' & nbsp ; m ) being the true reading , which would more closely conform with both the naval standards and the lengths of the other masts sydney parkinson 's sketches and paintings of cook 's bark endeavour along with the 1771 woolwich yard bark endeavour spar measurements national maritime museum in greenwich nmm zaz6594 , and other contemporary sources suggest that the shorter mizzen mast was not stepped in the hold/keelson , but instead was stepped in the lower deck above this as was sometimes done whereas the shorter mizzen stepped in the hold on the keelson instead of the lower deck would make the standing mizzen cap below the main mast cap which is clearly not the case when critically examining sydney parkinson 's drawings and the contemporary painting titled hms endeavour off the coast of new holland , by samuel atkins c zooming this painting also reveals that the position of the mizzen channel is forward to inline with the mast which it is when looking at the angle of the mizzen chainplates on the original as fitted draught nmm zaz7844 the replica standing mizzen is built to this shorter measurement and stepped in the hold on the keelson , as is the model in the national maritime museum in greenwich there is a difference between the height of the mizzen fore-and-aft spar in the contemporary painting of earl of pembroke before the naval refit of 1768 by luny ( below ) and its position on the replica in the photographs , compared to the height of the lowest spars on the fore and mainmasts on 16 february 1768 , the royal society petitioned king george iii to finance a scientific expedition to the pacific to study and observe the 1769 transit of venus across the sun 24 royal approval was granted for the expedition , and the admiralty elected to combine the scientific voyage with a confidential mission to search the south pacific for signs of the postulated continent terra australis incognita ( or '' unknown southern land '' ) first lord of the admiralty edward hawke refused , going so far as to say he would rather cut off his right hand than give command of a navy vessel to someone not educated as a seaman on the rear lower deck , cabins facing on to the mate 's mess were assigned to lieutenants zachary hickes and john gore , ship 's surgeon william monkhouse , the gunner stephen forwood , ship 's master robert molyneux , and the captain 's clerk richard orton at last , on 16 january the wind eased and the ship was able to pass the cape and anchor in the bay of good success on the pacific coast in october 1769 , endeavour reached the coastline of new zealand , becoming the first european vessel to do so since abel tasman 's heemskerck in 1642 unfamiliar with such ships , the māori people at cook 's first landing point in poverty bay thought the ship was a floating island , or a gigantic bird from their mythical homeland of hawaiki endeavour spent the next six months sailing close to shore , while cook mapped the coastline and concluded that new zealand comprised two large islands and was not the hoped-for terra australis 299 on 29 april , she became the first european vessel to make landfall on the east coast of australia , when cook landed one of the ship 's boats on the southern shore of what is now known as botany bay , new south wales 313 when , by cook 's reckoning , about of equipment had been thrown overboard , on the next high tide a second unsuccessful attempt was made to pull the ship free a mistake occurred in sounding the depth of water in the hold , when a new man measured the length of a sounding line from the outside plank of the hull where his predecessor had used the top of the cross-beams 321 he was entrusted with supervising the task , sewing bits of oakum and wool into an old sail , which was then drawn under the ship to allow water pressure to force it into the hole in the hull 189–190 endeavour then resumed her voyage westward along the coast , picking a path through intermittent shoals and reefs with the help of the pinnace , which was rowed ahead to test the water depth 386–389 by 26 august she was out of sight of land , and had entered the open waters of the torres strait between australia and new guinea , earlier navigated by luis váez de torres in 1606 426 after a three-day layover off the island of savu , endeavour sailed on to batavia , the capital of the dutch east indies , on 10 october the ship 's carpenter , john seetterly , observed that she was '' very leaky – makes from twelve to six & nbsp ; inches an hour , occasioned by her main keel being wounded in many places , false keel gone from beyond the midships 447 jonathan monkhouse , who had proposed fothering the ship to save her from sinking on the reef , died on 6 february , followed six days later by ship 's carpenter john seetterly , whose skilled repair work in batavia had allowed endeavour to resume her voyage 477 approximately one month after his return , cook was promoted to the rank of commander , and by november 1771 was in receipt of admiralty orders for a second expedition , this time aboard hms resolution she sailed from portsmouth on 8 november 1771 , but due to terrible weather did not arrive at port egmont ( the british base in the falkland islands ) until 1 march endeavour sailed in november with hugh kirkland as the sailing master , and additionally the crew of penguin , and four ship 's carpenters whose job was to reassemble penguin on arrival , which was 28 january 1773 the third voyage sailed in january 1774 with her purpose to evacuate the falklands entirely as britain was faced with political difficulties from the american colonies , the french and the spanish the government assessed that if british ships and troops were engaged in america , spain might seize the falklands , capturing the small garrison at port egmont with maybe loss of life – this , it was feared , would trigger an outcry which might topple the government lord sandwich 2 , master william author , sailed on 6 may 1776 from portsmouth in a fleet of 100 vessels , 68 of which were transports , which was under orders to support howe 's campaign to capture new york on 15 august 1776 lord sandwich 2 was anchored at sandy hook ; also assembled there was adventure , which had sailed with resolution on cook 's second voyage , now a storeship , captained by john hallum 216–7 new york was eventually captured , but newport , rhode island in the hands of the americans posed a threat as a base for recapturing new york , so in november 1776 a fleet , which included lord sandwich 2 carrying hessian troops , set out to take rhode island , which was taken but not subdued , and lord sandwich 2 was needed as a prison ship the surrender of british general john burgoyne 's army at saratoga brought france into the war , and in the summer of 1778 a pincer plan was agreed to recapture newport : the continental army would approach overland , and a french fleet would sail into the harbour the admiralty valuation for 10 of the sunken vessels recorded that many had been built in yorkshire , and the details of the lord sandwich transport matched those of the former endeavour including construction in whitby , a burthen of 368 71/94 & nbsp ; tons , and re-entry into navy service on 10 february 1776 16 in 1834 a letter appeared in the providence journal of rhode island , drawing attention to the possible presence of the former endeavour on the seabed of the bay it was later suggested liberté , which sank off newport in 1793 , was in fact another of cook 's ships , the former hms resolution , or another endeavour , a naval schooner sold out of service in 1782 a further letter to the providence journal stated that a retired english sailor was conducting guided tours of a hulk on the river thames as late as 1825 , claiming that the ship had once been cook 's endeavour in 1991 the rhode island marine archaeology project ( rimap ) began research into the identity of the thirteen transports sunk as part of the newport blockade of 1778 , including lord sandwich in 1999 rimap discovered documents in the public record office ( now called the national archives ) in london confirming that endeavour had been renamed lord sandwich , had served as a troop transport to north america , and had been scuttled at newport as part of the 1778 fleet of transports 23–26 and in 2000 , rimap and the anmm examined a site that appears to be one of the blockade vessels , partly covered by a separate wreck of a 20th-century barge in 2016 rimap concluded that there was a probability of 80 to 100 % that the wreck of endeavour was still in newport harbor , probably one of a cluster of five wrecks on the seafloor , and planned to investigate the ships and their artifacts further the possible discovery was hailed as a '' hugely significant moment '' in australian history , but researchers have warned they were yet to '' definitively '' confirm whether the wreck had been located in addition to the search for the remains of the ship herself , there was substantial australian interest in locating relics of the ship 's south pacific voyage remains of equipment left at endeavour river were discovered in around 1900 , and in 1913 the crew of a merchant steamer erroneously claimed to have recovered an endeavour cannon from shallow water near the reef they were finally recovered in 1969 by a research team from the american academy of natural sciences , using a sophisticated magnetometer to locate the cannon , a quantity of iron ballast and the abandoned bower anchor conservation work on the cannon was undertaken by the australian national maritime museum , after which two of the cannon were displayed at its headquarters in sydney 's darling harbour , and eventually put on display at botany bay and the national museum of australia in canberra ( with a replica remaining at the museum ) a third cannon and the bower anchor were displayed at the james cook museum in cooktown , with the remaining three at the national maritime museum in london , the academy of natural sciences in philadelphia , and the museum of new zealand te papa tongarewa in wellington endeavours pacific voyage was further commemorated in the use of her image on the reverse of the new zealand fifty-cent coin , and in the naming of the space shuttle endeavour in 1989 in january 1988 , to commemorate the australian bicentenary of european settlement in australia , work began in fremantle , western australia , on a replica of endeavour the replica vessel commenced her maiden voyage in october of that year , sailing to sydney harbour and then following cook 's path from botany bay northward to cooktown from 1996 to 2002 , the replica retraced cook 's ports of call around the world , arriving in the original endeavour home port of whitby in may 1997 and june 2002 her arrival in sydney was delayed when she ran aground in botany bay , a short distance from the point where cook first set foot in australia 235 & nbsp ; years earlier ownership of the replica was transferred to the australian national maritime museum in 2005 for permanent service as a museum ship in sydney 's darling harbour while it reflects the external dimensions of cook 's vessel , this replica was constructed with a steel rather than a timber frame , has one less internal deck than the original , and is not designed to go to sea provisions loaded at the outset of the voyage included 6,000 pieces of pork and 4,000 of beef , nine tons of bread , five tons of flour , three tons of sauerkraut , one ton of raisins and sundry quantities of cheese , salt , peas , oil , sugar and oatmeal cook noted that disease of various kinds had broken out aboard every ship berthed in batavia at the time , and that '' this seems to have been a year of general sickness over most parts of india '' and in england these were the four royal navy frigates on 5 august along the coast of aquidneck island north of newport : juno 32 , lark 32 , orpheus 32 , and cerberus 28 ;
