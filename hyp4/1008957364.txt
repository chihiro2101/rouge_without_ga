this is supported by dna analyses performed on the bees as they spread northwards ; those that were at the '' vanguard '' were over 90 % african mtdna , indicating an unbroken matriline , but after several years in residence in an area interbreeding with the local european strains , as in brazil , the overall representation of african mtdna drops to some degree the small number of honey bees with african ancestry that were introduced to brazil in 1956 , which dispersed and hybridized with existing managed populations of european origin and quickly spread across much of the americas , is an example of a massive biological invasion as earlier told in this article as of 2002 , the africanized honey bees had spread from brazil south to northern argentina and north to central america , trinidad ( the west indies ) , mexico , texas , arizona , nevada , new mexico , florida , and southern california there are now relatively stable geographic zones in which either africanized honey bees dominate , a mix of africanized and european honey bees is present , or only non-africanized honey bees are found , as in the southern portions of south america or northern north america though africanized honey bees display certain behavioral traits that make them less than desirable for commercial beekeeping , excessive defensiveness and swarming foremost , they have now become the dominant type of honey bee for beekeeping in central and south america due to their genetic dominance as well as ability to out-compete their european counterpart , with some beekeepers asserting that they are superior honey producers and pollinators african subspecies are assigned to branch & nbsp ; a , northwestern european subspecies to branch & nbsp ; m , southwestern european subspecies to branch & nbsp ; c , and mideast subspecies to branch & nbsp ; o according to kerr , in october & nbsp ; 1957 a visiting beekeeper , noticing that the queen excluders were interfering with the worker bees ' movement , removed them , resulting in the accidental release of 26 & nbsp ; tanganyikan swarms of a any effort to crossbreed virgin european queens with africanized drones will result in the offspring exhibiting africanized traits ; only 26 & nbsp ; escaped swarms in 1957 , and nearly six decades later there does not appear to be a lessening to any noticeable degree of the typical africanized characteristics the honey production from a single hive of africanized honey bees can be 100 & nbsp ; kg annually and far exceeds the much smaller 3â€“5 & nbsp ; kg of the various melipona stingless bee species population genetics analysis of africanized honey bees in the united states , using a maternally inherited genetic marker , found 12 & nbsp ; distinct mitotypes , and the amount of genetic variation observed supports the idea that there have been multiple introductions of ahb into the united states kerr was attempting to breed a strain of bees that would produce more honey in tropics conditions than the european strain of honey bee currently in use throughout north , central and south america there are two lineages of the east african lowland subspecies ( apis mellifera scutellata ) in the americas : actual matrilineal descendants of the original escaped queens and a much smaller number that are africanized through hybridization in a study conducted in arizona in 2004 it was observed that swarms of africanized honey bees could take over weakened european honey bee hives by invading the hive , then killing the european queen and establishing their own queen thus africanized honey bees are expected to be a hazard mostly in the southern states of the united states , reaching as far north as the chesapeake bay in the east it is also becoming apparent that africanized honey bees have another advantage over european honey bees in that they seem to show a higher resistance to several health issues , including parasites such as varroa destructor , some fungal diseases like chalkbrood and even the mysterious colony collapse disorder which is currently plaguing beekeepers although the native east african lowland honey bees ( apis mellifera scutellata ) are smaller and build smaller comb cells than the european honey bees , their hybrids are not smaller in the tucson region of arizona , a study of trapped swarms in 1994 found that only 15 & nbsp ; percent had been africanized ; this number had grown to 90 & nbsp ; percent by 1997 whether this will lead to their extinction is unknown , but they are well adapted to exist in the wild , and there are a number of indigenous plants that the africanized honey bees do not visit , so their fate remains to be seen some belong to apis mellifera intermissa , but others have an indeterminate origin ; the egyptian honeybee ( apis mellifera lamarckii ) , present in small numbers in the southeastern u.s the descendants of these colonies have since spread throughout the americas , moving through the amazon basin in the 1970s , crossing into central america in 1982 , and reaching mexico in 1985 also while bee incidents are much less common than they were during the first wave of africanized honey bee colonization , this can be largely attributed to modified and improved bee management techniques while studies have shown that africanized honey bees can infiltrate european honey bee colonies and then kill and replace their queen ( thus usurping the hive ) , this is less common than other methods in october & nbsp ; 2010 , a 73-year-old man was killed by a swarm of africanized honey bees while clearing brush on his south georgia property , as determined by georgia 's department of agriculture africanized honey bees , as opposed to other western bee types : tend to swarm more frequently and go farther than other types of honey bees this is believed to be because the more gentle bees contain genetic material that is more similar to the european honey bee , although they also contain africanized honey bee material scutellata and italian bee published by fewell and bertram in 2002 suggests that the differential evolution of this suite of behaviors is due to the different environmental pressures experienced by african and european subspecies work has been done in brazil towards this end , but in order to maintain these traits , it is necessary to develop a queen breeding and mating facility in order to requeen colonies and to prevent reintroduction of unwanted genes or characteristics through unintended crossbreeding with feral colonies the prospect of killer bees arriving in the united states caused a media sensation in the late 1970s , inspired several horror movies , and sparked debate about the wisdom of humans altering entire ecosystems the arrival of the africanized honey bee in central america is threatening the ancient art of keeping melipona stingless bees in log gums , although they do not interbreed or directly compete with each other in june & nbsp ; 2013 , 62-year-old larry goodwin of moody , texas was killed by a swarm of africanized honey bees
