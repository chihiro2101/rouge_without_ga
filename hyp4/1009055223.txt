enthusiastic about the event hitler defended may against critics in the men 's hostel where he lived in vienna , as the evidence of may 's earlier time in jail had come to light ; although it was true , hitler confessed that may had never visited the sites of his american adventure stories hitler later recommended the books to his generals and had special editions distributed to soldiers at the front , praising winnetou as an example of '' tactical finesse and circumspection '' , though some note that the latter claims of using the books as military guidance are not substantiated in his
