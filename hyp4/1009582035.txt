letter to us senate on human cloning , ( march 19 , 2002 ) one concern is that blastula creation in scnt-based human stem cell research will lead to the reproductive cloning of humans however , by

april 2014 and in 2016 a korean company , sooam biotech , was reported to be producing 500 cloned embryos a day interspecies nuclear transfer ( iscnt ) is a means of somatic cell nuclear transfer being used to facilitate the rescue of endangered species , or even to restore species after their extinction for example , in 1996 dolly the sheep was born after 277 eggs were used for scnt , which created 29 viable embryos , giving it just a measly 0.3 % efficiency nuclear transfer â€“ stem cells or somatic cell nuclear transfer ( scnt ) the international society for stem cell research the

using fetal and infant donor cells the addition of caffeine during the removal of the ovum 's nucleus and fusion of the somatic cell and the egg improved blastocyst formation and esc isolation in 2003 , the united nations adopted a proposal submitted by costa rica , calling on member states to '' prohibit all forms of human cloning in as much as they are incompatible with human dignity and the

human fertilisation and embryology authority in order to perform or attempt scnt this is thought to be a result from the somatic cell nucleus being unable to turn on embryonic genes crucial for proper development development will ensue normally and after many mitotic divisions , the single cell forms a blastocyst ( an early stage embryo with about 100 cells ) with an identical genome to the

to the blastocyst stage stem cell experts consider it unlikely that such large numbers of human egg donations would occur in a developed country because of the unknown long-term public health effects of treating large numbers of healthy young women with heavy doses of hormones in order to induce hyper-ovulation ( ovulating several eggs at once ) recent studies show scnt of the nucleus of a body cell afflicted with one of these diseases into a healthy oocyte prevents the inheritance of the mitochondrial disease this raises the question of how well ips cells can mimic the gold standard esc in experiments , as stem cells are defined as having the ability to differentiate into any cell type ) potentially millions of patients could benefit from stem cell therapy , and each patient would require a large number of donated eggs in order to successfully create a single custom therapeutic stem cell line the blastocyst stage is developed by the egg to help create embryonic stem cells from the inner cell mass of the blastocyst a father providing a sperm cell , one mother providing the egg nucleus , and another mother providing the enucleated egg cell as a consequence , clones such as dolly that are born from scnt are not perfect copies of the donor of the nucleus the scientist 19 june 2007 though there has been numerous successes with cloning animals , questions remain concerning the mechanisms of reprogramming in the ovum
