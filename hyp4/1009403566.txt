rather , it was his magnetic personality and method of lecturing that so influenced his students and caused the greatest of those to reverentially refer to him as '' the never to be forgotten hutcheson '' , a title that smith in all his correspondence used to describe only two people , his good friend david hume and influential mentor , hutcheson he was the '' son of a presbyterian minister of ulster scottish stock , who was born in ireland francis alison , the professor of moral philosophy at the college of philadelphia , was a former student of hutcheson who closely followed hutcheson 's thought it is easy to trace the influence of hutcheson 's ethical theories on the systems of hume and adam smith hutcheson was well regarded as one of the most prominent lecturers at the university of glasgow in his day and earned the approbation of students , colleagues , and even ordinary residents of glasgow with the fervour and earnestness of his orations oxford dictionary of biography , '' francis hutcheson '' by james moore , retrieved 9 august 2013 while living in dublin , hutcheson published anonymously the four essays for which he is best known : in 1725 inquiry concerning beauty , order , harmony and design , and inquiry concerning moral good and evil , which together comprise his inquiry into the original of our ideas of beauty and virtue ;

mackintosh 's progress of ethical philosophy ; cousin , cours d'histoire de la philosophie morale du xviii ' siècle ; whewell 's lectures on the history of moral philosophy in england ; a bain 's mental and moral science ;

but no sooner is the intellectual process complete than there is excited in us a feeling similar to what myriads of actions and habits of ( apparently ) the same class excited in us on former occasions the prominence given by these writers to the analysis of moral action and moral approbation with the attempt to discriminate the respective provinces of the reason and the emotions in these processes , is undoubtedly due to the influence of hutcheson to a study of the writings of shaftesbury and hutcheson we might , probably , in large measure , attribute the unequivocal adoption of the utilitarian standard by hume , and , if this be the case , the name of hutcheson connects itself , through hume , with the names of priestley , paley and bentham norman fiering , a specialist in the intellectual history of colonial new england , has described francis hutcheson as '' probably the most influential and respected moral philosopher in america in the eighteenth century '' ) and the disposition to refer on disputed questions of philosophy not so much to formal arguments as to the testimony of consciousness and our natural instincts are also amongst the points in which hutcheson supplemented or departed from the philosophy of locke we thus see that , not only directly but also through the replies that it called forth , the system of hutcheson , or at least the system of hutcheson combined with that of shaftesbury , contributed , in large measure , to the formation and development of some of the most important of the modern schools of ethics this consideration could hardly escape any author , however wedded to his own system , and hutcheson attempts to extricate himself from the difficulty by laying down the position that a man may justly regard himself as a part of the rational system , and may thus be , in part , an object of his own benevolence ( ibid ) , a curious abuse of terms , which really concedes the question at issue during his time as a lecturer in glasgow college he taught and influenced adam smith , the economist and philosopher in 1729 , hutcheson succeeded his old master , gershom carmichael , in the chair of moral philosophy at the university of glasgow , being the first professor there to lecture in english instead of latin thus , in stating his theory of the moral sense , hutcheson is peculiarly careful to repudiate the doctrine of innate ideas ( see , for instance , inquiry concerning moral good and evil , sect for , as established by hume , this act consists of two parts : an act of deliberation leading to an intellectual judgement ; and a reflex feeling of satisfaction at actions we consider good , and of dissatisfaction at those we consider bad he does not attempt to give an exhaustive enumeration of these '' senses , '' but , in various parts of his works , he specifies , besides the five external senses commonly recognized ( which he hints might be added to ) : consciousness , by which each man has a perception of himself and of all that is going on in his own mind ( metaph '' hutcheson 's short introduction to moral philosophy was used as a textbook at the college of philadelphia in the 1760s his standpoint has a negative and a positive aspect ; he is in strong opposition to thomas hobbes and mandeville , and in fundamental agreement with shaftesbury , whose name he very properly coupled with his own on the title page of the first two essays hutcheson 's early inquiry into the original of our ideas of beauty and virtue , introducing his perennial association of '' unalienable rights '' with the collective right to resist oppressive government , was used at harvard college as a textbook as early as the 1730s dr william king , the church of ireland lord archbishop of dublin , who refused to prosecute hutcheson in the archbishop 's court for keeping a school without the episcopal licence references to hutcheson occur in histories , both of general philosophy and of moral philosophy , as , for instance , in pt according to hutcheson , man has a variety of senses , internal as well as external , reflex as well as direct , the general definition of a sense being '' any determination of our minds to receive ideas independently on our will , and to have perceptions of pleasure and pain '' ( essay on the nature and conduct of the passions , sect to the period of his dublin residence are also to be referred the thoughts on laughter ( 1725 ) ( a criticism of thomas hobbes ) and the observations on the fable of the bees , being in all six letters contributed to hibernicus ' letters , a periodical that appeared in dublin ( 1725–1727 , 2nd ed
