but the project lapsed through his being summoned away from venice in 1547 to paint charles v and others in augsburg during this period ( 1516–1530 ) , which may be called the period of his mastery and maturity , the artist moved on from his early giorgionesque style , undertook larger , more complex subjects , and for the first time attempted a monumental style but this period of the master 's work is still represented by the presentation of the blessed virgin ( venice , 1539 ) , one of his most popular canvasses , and by the ecce homo ( vienna , 1541 ) file : titian - the sick man - wga22934.jpg portrait of a sick man , 1515 , oil on canvas ;

and perhaps it may be fairer to suppose that the drawings exhibited so much independence of manner that titian judged that young jacopo , although he might become a painter , would never be properly a pupil in 1538 , the venetian government , dissatisfied with titian 's neglect of his work for the ducal palace , ordered him to refund the money he had received , and il pordenone , his rival of recent years , was installed in his place the painting belongs to a series commissioned from bellini , titian , and dosso dossi , for the camerino d'alabastro ( alabaster room ) in the ducal palace , ferrara , by alfonso i d'este , duke of ferrara , who in 1510 even tried to commission michelangelo and raphael titian 's skill with colour is exemplified by his danaë , one of several mythological paintings , or '' poesie '' ( '' poems '' ) as the painter called them marco vecellio , called marco di tiziano , born in 1545 , was titian 's nephew and was constantly with the master in his old age , and learned his methods of work '' titian '' , the catholic encyclopedia among portrait-painters titian is compared to rembrandt and velázquez , with the interior life of the former , and the clearness , certainty , and obviousness of the latter the mansion , difficult to find now , is in the biri grande , then a fashionable suburb , at the extreme end of venice , on the sea , with beautiful gardens and a view towards murano it was titian 's most important attempt at a tumultuous and heroic scene of movement to rival raphael 's battle of constantine , michelangelo 's equally ill-fated battle of cascina , and leonardo da vinci 's the battle of anghiari ( these last two unfinished ) jill dunkerton and marika spring , with contributions from rachel billinge , kamilla kalinina , rachel morrison , gabriella macaro , david peggie and ashok roy , titian ’ s painting technique to c.1540 , national gallery technical bulletin , volume 34 , 2013 , pp another famous painting is bacchus and ariadne , depicting theseus , whose ship is shown in the distance and who has just left ariadne at naxos , when bacchus arrives , jumping from his chariot , drawn by two cheetahs , and falling immediately in love with ariadne tintoretto had only been ten days in the studio when titian sent him home for good , because the great master observed some very spirited drawings , which he learned to be the production of tintoretto ; it is inferred that he became at once jealous of so promising a student titian had a favorite villa on the neighboring manza hill ( in front of the church of castello roganzuolo ) from which ( it may be inferred ) he made his chief observations of landscape form and effect giorgione had already dealt with the subject in his dresden picture , finished by titian , but here a purple drapery substituted for a landscape background changed , by its harmonious colouring , the whole meaning of the scene the minor painter sebastian zuccato , whose sons became well-known mosaicists , and who may have been a family friend , arranged for the brothers to enter the studio of the elderly gentile bellini , from which they later transferred to that of his brother giovanni bellini as a matter of professional and worldly success , his position from about this time is regarded as equal only to that of raphael , michelangelo and , at a later date , rubens this was a noteworthy performance , of which titian ( the usual story ) became jealous ; so francesco was diverted from painting to soldiering , and afterwards to mercantile life one of the earliest known titian works , christ carrying the cross in the scuola grande di san rocco , depicting the ecce homo scene , was long regarded as by giorgione from the beginning of his career , titian was a masterful portrait-painter , in works like la bella ( eleanora de gonzaga , duchess of urbino , at the pitti palace ) on the other hand , from the standpoint of flesh tints , his most moving pictures are those of his old age , such as the poesie and the antiope of the louvre 14 the signoria took note and observed that titian was neglecting his work in the hall of the great council , but in 1516 he succeeded his master giovanni bellini in receiving a pension from the senate however , at the end of a year pordenone died , and titian , who meanwhile applied himself diligently to painting in the hall the battle of cadore , was reinstated for philip ii , he painted a series of large mythological paintings known as the '' poesie '' , mostly from ovid , which scholars regard as among his greatest works one of these , diana and actaeon , was purchased by london 's national gallery and the national galleries of scotland on 2 february 2009 for £50 & nbsp ; million in addition to the common pigments of the renaissance period , such as ultramarine , vermilion , lead-tin-yellow , ochres , and azurite , he also used the rare pigments realgar and orpiment it combined extreme violence and a landscape , mostly consisting of a great tree , that pressed into the scene and seems to accentuate the drama in a way that looks forward to the baroque most modern scholars believe a date between 1488 and 1490 is more likely , hale , 5-6 ; also see references above though his age at death being 99 had been accepted into the 20th century she had succeeded her aunt orsa , then deceased , as the manager of the household , which , with the lordly income that titian made by this time , placed her on a corresponding footing
