there are three main types of contemporary metal handcuffs : chain ( cuffs are held together by a short chain ) , hinged ( since hinged handcuffs permit less movement than a chain cuff , they are generally considered to be more secure ) , and rigid solid bar handcuffs both rigid and hinged cuffs can be used one-handed to apply pain-compliance/control techniques that are not workable with the chain type of cuff various accessories are available to improve the security or increase the rigidity of handcuffs , including boxes that fit over the chain or hinge and can themselves be locked with a padlock '' mitten handcuffs secure criminal '' , october 1933 , popular science middle of page 27 , right side handcuffs may be manufactured from various metals , including carbon steel , stainless steel and aluminium , or from synthetic polymers sometimes two pairs of handcuffs are needed to restrain a person with an exceptionally large waistline because the hands can not be brought close enough together ; in this case , one cuff on one pair of handcuffs is handcuffed to one of the cuffs on the other pair , and then the remaining open handcuff on each pair is applied to the person 's wrists recent products have been introduced that serve to address this concern , including disposable plastic restraints that can be opened or loosened with a key ; more expensive than conventional plastic restraints , they can only be used a very limited number of times , and are not as strong as conventional disposable restraints , let alone modern metal handcuffs in addition , plastic restraints are believed by many to be more likely to inflict nerve or soft-tissue damage to the wearer than metal handcuffs on occasions when a suspect exhibits extremely aggressive behavior , fetters may be used in addition to handcuffs ; sometimes the chain connecting the leg irons to one another is looped around the chain of the handcuffs , and then the leg irons are applied , resulting in the person being '' hogtie '' in a few rare cases , hog-tied persons lying on their stomachs have died from positional asphyxia , making the practice highly controversial , and leading to its being severely restricted , or even completely banned , in many localities when the handcuffs are concealed by a handcuff cover and secured at the prisoner 's waist by a belly chain , this combination will result in a rather more severe restraint and the restrained person may feel discomfort or even pain double locks are generally disengaged by inserting the key and rotating it in the opposite direction from that used to unlock the cuff most modern handcuffs in canada , the united states , the united kingdom and latin america can be opened with the same standard universal handcuff key to prevent the restrained person from eventually opening the handcuffs with a handcuff key , a handcuff cover may be used to conceal the keyholes of the handcuffs suspects are handcuffed with the keyholes facing up ( away from the hands ) to make it difficult to open them even with a key or improvised lock-pick because a person 's hands are used in breaking falls , being handcuffed introduces a significant risk of injury if the prisoner trips or stumbles , in addition to injuries sustained from overly tight handcuffs causing handcuff neuropathy there are several ways of escaping from handcuffs : slipping hands out when the hands are smaller than the wrist lock picking releasing the pawl with a shim opening the handcuffs with a duplicate key , often hidden on the body of the performer before the performance it is also technically possible to break free from handcuffs by applying massive amounts of force from one 's arms to cause the device to split apart or loosen enough to squeeze one 's hands through ; however , this takes exceptional strength ( especially with handcuffs made of steel ) this also puts an immense amount of pressure on the biceps and triceps muscles , and when tried by suspects ( even unsuccessfully ) can lead to injury , including bruising around the wrists , or tearing the muscles used ( including pulling them off their attachments to the bones ) another common method of escaping ( or attempting to escape ) from being handcuffed behind the back , is that one would , from a sitting or lying position , bring one 's legs up as high upon one 's torso as possible , then push one 's arms down to bring the handcuffs below one 's feet , finally pulling the handcuffs up using one 's arms to the front of one 's body it can also be done from a standing position , where , with some degree of effort , the handcuffed hands are slid around the hips and down the buttocks to the feet ; then sliding each foot up and over the cuffs similarly , in france , a law prohibits media from airing images of people in handcuffs , or otherwise restrained , before they have been convicted by a court : golden handcuffs â€“ an incentive given to an employee by a firm , most or all of which must be repaid to the company if the employee leaves the firm within a specified period of time
