when a laryngeal is attested directly , it is usually as a special type of vowel and not as a consonant , best exemplified in greek where syllabic laryngeals ( when they appeared next to only consonants ) developed as such : h₁ > e , h₂ > a , and h₃ > o the laryngeal syllabified after a consonant ( thus greek patḗr , latin pater , sanskrit pitár- ; greek thugátēr , sanskrit duhitár- '' daughter '' ) but lengthened a preceding vowel ( thus say latin māter '' mother '' , frāter '' brother '' ) — even when the '' vowel '' in question was a syllabic resonant , as in sanskrit yātaras '' husbands ' wives '' proto-italic sed-ē-ye-mos '' we are sitting '' > latin sedēmus ) later it was noticed that the explanatory power of the theory , as well as its elegance , were enhanced if a third element were added , our h₁ , which has the same lengthening and syllabifying properties as the other two but has no effect on the colour of adjacent vowels saussure called them simply '' coefficients sonantiques '' , which was the term for what are now in english more usually called resonants ; that is , the six elements present in pie which can be either consonants ( non-syllabic ) or vowels ( syllabic ) depending on the sounds they are adjacent to : y w r l m n this means that there is no possibility of some sort of analogical interference , for example , happened in the case of latin arātrum '' plow '' , whose shape has been distorted by the verb arāre '' to plow '' ( the exact cognate to the greek form would have been aretrum ) this consonant did not appear to be related to any of the consonants then reconstructed for pie , and various unsatisfactory proposals were made to explain this consonant in terms of the pie consonant system as it had then been reconstructed although the founding fathers were able to provide some indirect evidence of a lost consonantal element ( for example , the origin of the indo-iranian voiceless aspirates in ch sequences and the ablaut pattern of the so-called heavy bases , cerə- ~ cr̥̄- in the traditional formulation ) , the direct evidence so crucial for the neogrammarian thinking was lacking but in hittite there is a noun '' front , face '' , with various derivatives ( ḫantezzi '' first '' , and so on ) , pointing to a pie root-noun '' face '' ( of which would be the locative singular ) weiss ( 2016 ) suggests that this was the case in proto-indo-european proper , and that a shift from uvular into pharyngeal may have been a common innovation of the non-anatolian languages ( before the consonant 's eventual loss ) the lateness of the discovery of these sounds by indo-europeanists is largely because hittite and the other anatolian languages are the only indo-european languages for which at least some are attested directly and consistently as consonantal sounds 71 its failure ( unlike h₂ and h₃ ) to create an auxiliary vowel in greek and tocharian when it occurs between a semivowel and a consonant , and the typological likelihood of an given the presence of aspirated consonants in pie saussure did not suggest as to the phonetics of these elements ; his term for them , '' coefficients sonantiques '' , was not however a fudge , but merely the term in general use for glides , nasals , and liquids ( i.e this not only accounted for the patterns of alternation more economically than before ( by requiring fewer types of ablaut ) but also brought the structure of these roots into line with the basic pie pattern which required roots to begin and end with a consonant the same evidence is also consistent with the assumption that they were fricative sounds ( as opposed to approximants or stops ) , an assumption that is strongly supported by the behaviour of laryngeals in consonant clusters '' an occasionally advanced idea is that the laryngeals were dorsal fricatives corresponding directly to the three traditionally reconstructed series of dorsal stops ( '' palatal '' , velar , and labiovelar ) suggests a further possibility , a palatal fricative from what is known of such phonetic conditioning in contemporary languages , notably semitic languages , h₂ ( the '' a-colouring '' laryngeal ) could have been a pharyngeal fricative such as and thus the compound - '' to 'fix thought ' , be devout , become rapt '' forms a noun - seen in proto-indo-iranian mazdha- whence sanskrit medhá- /mēdha/ '' sacrificial rite , holiness '' ( regular development as in sedur greek ( homeric ) génos , -eos , sanskrit jánas- , avestan zanō , latin genus , -eris later , kloekhorst ( 2006 ) claimed that also hittite preserves pie h₁ as a glottal stop , visible in words like hittite e-eš-zi 'he is ' melchert ( 2010 ) , and weeden ( 2011 ) the explanation for the híeros/híaros business has long been discussed , without much result ; laryngeal theory now provides the opportunity for an explanation which did not exist before , namely the metathesis of the two laryngeals the beginnings of the theory were proposed by ferdinand de saussure in 1879 , in an article chiefly devoted to something else altogether ( demonstrating that a and o were separate phonemes in pie ) ) : : -h₁s- derives desiderative stems as in sanskrit jighāṃsati '' desires to slay '' for the first half-century of its existence , the laryngeal theory was widely seen as ‘ an eccentric fancy of outsiders ’ while some scholars , like heinz kronasser and giuliano bonfante , attempted to disregard anatolian evidence altogether , the ‘ minimal ’ serious proposal ( with roots in pedersen 's early ideas ) was put forward by hans hendriksen , louis hammerich and later ladislav zgusta , who assumed a single /h/ phoneme without vowel-colouring effects most scholars work with a basic three : , the '' neutral '' laryngeal , the '' a-colouring '' laryngeal , the '' o-colouring '' laryngeal some direct evidence for laryngeal consonants comes from anatolian : pie a is a fairly rare sound , and in an uncommonly large number of good etymologies , it is word-initial in the course of his analysis , saussure proposed that what had then been reconstructed as long vowels ā and ō , alternating with ǝ , was an ordinary type of pie ablaut
