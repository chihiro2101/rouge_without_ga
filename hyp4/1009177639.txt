in the 12th century ad , it is richest for vijaya ; following the 15th century ad , it is richest for panduranga a segmented liṅga is a linga post divided into three sections to represent the three aspects of the hindu godhead or trimurti : the lowest section , square in shape , represents brahma ;

chinese and vietnamese annals , diplomatic reports , and other literature such as those provided by jia dan ; historiography of modern cham people though cham territory included the mountainous zones west of the coastal plain and ( at times ) extended into present-day laos , for the most part , the cham remained a seafaring people dedicated to trade , and maintained few settlements of any size away from the coast between the 7th to 10th centuries ad , the cham polities rose to become a naval power ; as champan ports attracted local and foreign traders , champan fleets also controlled the trade in spices and silk in the south china sea , between china , the indonesian archipelago and india most cham are now evenly split between being followers of islam and hinduism , with the majority of vietnamese cham being hindu while the majority of cambodian cham are muslim , though significant minorities of mahayana buddhists continue to exist while today the bacam ( bacham ) are the only surviving hindus in vietnam , the region once hosted some of the most exquisite and vibrant hinduism in the world in the 4th century ad , wars with the neighbouring kingdom of funan in cambodia and the acquisition of funanese territory led to the infusion of indian culture into cham society however , the rising influence of champa caught the attention of a neighbouring thalassocracy that considered champa as a rival , the javanese ( javaka , probably refers to srivijaya ruler of malay peninsula , sumatra and java ) khu túc ( known in chinese sources as qusu ) located along the kiến giang river of quảng bình province , was built in the 4th century ad and includes a revetted wall and moat as do the other centers cham people descended from seafaring settlers who reached the southeast asian mainland from borneo about the time of the sa huỳnh culture between 1000 bc and 200 ad , the predecessor of the cham kingdom in ad 767 , the tonkin coast was raided by a javanese fleet ( daba ) and kunlun pirates , champa was subsequently assaulted by javanese or kunlun vessels in ad 774 and ad 787 some of the sites that have yielded important works of religious art and architecture from this period are , aside from mỹ sơn , khương mỹ , trà kiệu , chanh lo , and tháp mắm religiously and culturally , the chams were grouped into two major religio-cultural groups ; the balamon chams that adhere to an indigenized form of hinduism , and bani chams that adhere to an indigenized form of islam it remained the centre of champa until ad 1471 , when it was sacked by the việt and the centre of champa was again displaced toward the south balamon chams adhere to the old religion of their ancestor , an indigenized form of hinduism that thrived since the ancient era of kingdom of champa in 5th century ce scholars agree that historically champa was divided into several regions or principalities spread out from south to north along the coast of modern vietnam and united by a common language , culture , and heritage between the 2nd and the 15th centuries ad , champa at times included the modern provinces of quảng nam , quảng ngãi , bình định , phú yên , khánh hòa , ninh thuận , and bình thuận champa came to serve as an important link in the spice trade , which stretched from the persian gulf to south china , and later in the arab maritime routes in mainland southeast asia as a supplier of aloe evidence gathered from linguistic studies around aceh confirms that a very strong champan cultural influence existed in indonesia ; this is indicated by the use of the chamic language acehnese as the main language in the coastal regions of aceh hardy 2009 , 110–11 maritime trade was facilitated by a network of wells that provided fresh water to cham and foreign ships along the coast of champa and the islands of cù lao chàm and lý sơn lâm ấp , a predecessor state in the region , began its existence in ad 192 as a breakaway chinese colony
