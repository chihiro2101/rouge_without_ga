whether an incremental increase to government spending will have a multiplier effect is thought to depend on circumstances in the economy : first , particularly on the extent to which unemployment of resources may be high , so that the additional demand represented by government purchases may be realized by additional production and higher utilization of resources , without bidding up prices ; second , by the state of the financial and credit markets , where demand for money and money instruments may welcome additional government debt as low-risk securities , but may regard investment in private production capacity or capital formation as too risky , given a low level of general business activity the argument that the choice of taxes or borrowing to finance government spending must be equivalent in that taxpayers observe borrowing and save in anticipation of taxes to repay the borrowing is known as ricardian equivalence , and is sometimes cited as a rationale for believing that fiscal stimulus policy will be made futile by the reactions of rational consumers and businesses , reducing their spending or investing in exact proportion to increases in public spending , in a scenario similar to that envisioned in the treasury view many economists subscribe to a consensus view in which monetary policy is preferred as a means of regulating the business cycle , and fiscal stimulus is regarded as effective only in circumstances in which monetary policy has become ineffective , because policy interest rates are approaching the zero lower bound or a liquidity trap has developed , in which the financial system is hoarding money and failing to finance risky investment in capital formation and increased output in the history of economic thought , the notion that any increase in government spending necessarily crowds out an equal amount of private spending or investment , through taxation or borrowing , and thus has no net impact on economic activity , is known as the treasury view , and is regarded as generally fallacious even a balanced budget fiscal stimulus—additional public purchases fully financed by equivalent increases in taxation without any additional public borrowing—may have a multiplier greater than 1 , as the increase in output and business activity reduces persistent unemployment and the anxiety driving hoarding , with resulting increases in private consumption and investment reducing the time it takes for the economy to return to full employment additional public borrowing and spending would tend to increase interest rates , because the monetary authority would increase interest rates in response to additional public borrowing and spending , in an effort to contain the effects on the level of public activity—to prevent overheating in the demand for resources and inflation , for example it found that the output effect of an increase in government consumption is larger in industrial than in developing countries , the fiscal multiplier is relatively large in economies operating under predetermined exchange rate but zero in economies operating under flexible exchange rates ; fiscal multipliers in open economies are lower than in closed economies and fiscal multipliers in high-debt countries are also zero : in answering the question , we are concerned with the aggregate impact of different types of fiscal tightening on gdp ( measured using so-called ‘ fiscal multipliers ’ ) and not simply the direct contribution that government investment and consumption of goods and services makes to the expenditure measure of gdp for example , it may be argued that tax cuts or spending aimed at the lowest income households , whose spending is most constrained by income , will have a higher multiplier , because such households will spend a larger fraction of any addition to income faster it is sometimes argued that if the money is borrowed , it must eventually be paid back with interest , such that the long-term effect on the economy depends on the trade off between the immediate increase to the gdp and the long-term cost of servicing the resulting government debt whether that would or should justify otherwise wasteful government spending is controversial , on the one hand , and on the other hand , whether the supposed wastefulness of government spending justifies reducing multiplier estimates that reflect only gdp effects to smaller estimates reflecting welfare effects , remains a matter of political controversy the net fiscal stimulus may be increased by raising spending above the level of tax revenues , reducing taxes below the level of government spending , or any combination of the two that results in the government taxing less than it spends the existence of idle capacity and involuntary unemployment of labor in the economy can be represented as an output gap—a difference between actual gdp and potential gdp—and a policy of fiscal stimulus may aim at introducing sufficient additional spending , amplified by the multiplier , to speed the closing of the output gap the idea is that the total increase in production and income by all parties throughout the economy may be greater than the original increment to government spending , as additional resources are drawn into the circular flows of money spending and business activity through the economy : '' in trying to explain the unexpected weakness of gdp growth over this period , it is natural to ask whether it was caused in part by fiscal tightening – either because it turned out to be larger than we had originally assumed or because a given tightening did more to depress gdp than we had originally assumed in such circumstances , policy to increase aggregate demand and total business activity by means of fiscal measures may treat additional purchases and reductions in taxes as interchangeable near equivalents , with the changes in the net difference between spending and taxation identified as the deficit-financed fiscal stimulus y is original output ( gdp ) b_c is marginal propensity to consume ( mpc ) b_t is original income tax rate b_m is marginal propensity to import \delta y is change in income ( equivalent to gdp ) \delta g is change in government spending \delta t is change in aggregate taxes
