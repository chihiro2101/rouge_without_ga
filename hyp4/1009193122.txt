this non-galvanic form of corrosion can occur when a metal is subjected to a hot atmosphere containing oxygen , sulfur , or other compounds capable of oxidizing ( or assisting the oxidation of ) the material concerned special alloys , either with low carbon content or with added carbon '' getters '' such as titanium and niobium ( in types 321 and 347 , respectively ) , can prevent this effect , but the latter require special heat treatment after welding to prevent the similar phenomenon of '' knifeline attack '' while the corrosion pits only nucleate under fairly extreme circumstances , they can continue to grow even when conditions return to normal , since the interior of a pit is naturally deprived of oxygen and locally the ph decreases to very low values and the corrosion rate increases due to an autocatalytic process chemicals that inhibit corrosion include some of the salts in hard water ( roman water systems are famous for their mineral deposits ) , chromates , phosphates , polyaniline , other conducting polymers and a wide range of specially designed chemicals that resemble surfactants ( i.e platings usually fail only in small sections , but if the plating is more noble than the substrate ( for example , chromium on steel ) , a galvanic couple will cause any exposed area to corrode much more rapidly than an unplated surface would some conditions that inhibit passivation include high ph for aluminium and zinc , low ph or the presence of chloride ions for stainless steel , high temperature for titanium ( in which case the oxide dissolves into the metal , rather than the electrolyte ) and fluoride ions for silicon in a galvanic cell , the more active metal ( the anode ) corrodes at an accelerated rate and the more noble metal ( the cathode ) corrodes at a slower rate passivation refers to the spontaneous formation of an ultrathin film of corrosion products , known as a passive film , on the metal 's surface that act as a barrier to further oxidation for example , when sulfuric acid 2 4 ) flows through steel pipes , the iron in the steel reacts with the acid to form a passivation coating of iron sulfate 4 ) and hydrogen gas 2 ) in the presence of oxygen ( aerobic ) , some bacteria may directly oxidize iron to iron oxides and hydroxides , other bacteria oxidize sulfur and produce sulfuric acid causing biogenic sulfide corrosion in any given environment ( one standard medium is aerated , room-temperature seawater ) , one metal will be either more noble or more active than others , based on how strongly its ions are bound to the surface cathodic protection ( cp ) is a technique to control the corrosion of a metal surface by making that surface the cathode of an electrochemical cell crevice corrosion is a localized form of corrosion occurring in confined spaces ( crevices ) , to which the access of the working fluid from the environment is limited the suspected mechanism is firstly the deposition of a graphite layer on the surface of the metal , usually from carbon monoxide ( co ) in the vapor phase metal dusting is a catastrophic form of corrosion that occurs when susceptible materials are exposed to environments with high carbon activities , such as synthesis gas and other high-co environments galvanic corrosion occurs when two different metals have physical or electrical contact with each other and are immersed in a common electrolyte , or when the same metal is exposed to electrolyte with different concentrations certain conditions , such as low concentrations of oxygen or high concentrations of species such as chloride which compete as anions , can interfere with a given alloy 's ability to re-form a passivating film the formation of oxides on stainless steels , for example , can provide a protective layer preventing further atmospheric attack , allowing for a material to be used for sustained periods at both room and high temperatures in hostile conditions in extreme cases , the sharp tips of extremely long and narrow corrosion pits can cause stress concentration to the point that otherwise tough alloys can shatter ; a thin film pierced by an invisibly small hole can hide a thumb sized pit from view pitting remains among the most common and damaging forms of corrosion in passivated alloys , but it can be prevented by control of the alloy 's environment this form of corrosion is often difficult to detect due to the fact that it is usually relatively small and may be covered and hidden by corrosion-produced compounds passivation in natural environments such as air , water and soil at moderate ph is seen in such materials as aluminium , stainless steel , titanium , and silicon such high-temperature corrosion products , in the form of compacted oxide layer glazes , prevent or reduce wear during high-temperature sliding contact of metallic ( or metallic and ceramic ) surfaces if breakdown occurs in the passive film due to chemical or mechanical factors , the resulting major modes of corrosion may include pitting corrosion , crevice corrosion , and stress corrosion cracking this creates a galvanic couple with the well-protected alloy nearby , which leads to '' weld decay '' ( corrosion of the grain boundaries in the heat affected zones ) in highly corrosive environments some unprotected metallic alloys are extremely vulnerable to corrosion , such as those used in neodymium magnets , which can spall or crumble into powder even in dry , temperature-stable indoor environments unless properly treated to discourage corrosion the method involves exposing a clean weighed piece of the metal or alloy to the corrosive environment for a specified time followed by cleaning to remove corrosion products and weighing the piece to determine the loss of weight for example , materials used in aerospace , power generation and even in car engines have to resist sustained periods at high temperature in which they may be exposed to an atmosphere containing potentially highly corrosive products of combustion the rate of corrosion ( r ) is calculated as : r \frac the standardized test iso 719 is not suitable for glasses with poor or not extractable alkaline components , but which are still attacked by water , e.g pitting results when a small hole , or cavity , forms in the metal , usually as a result of de-passivation of a small area on the other hand , unusual conditions may result in passivation of materials that are normally unprotected , as the alkaline environment of concrete does for steel rebar the polarization is caused by the current flow from the anode to the cathode , driven by the difference in electrode potential between the anode and the cathode in the chemical industry , hydrogen grooving is the corrosion of piping by grooves created by the interaction of a corrosive agent , corroded pipe constituents , and hydrogen gas bubbles various treatments are used to slow corrosion damage to metallic objects which are exposed to the weather , salt water , acids , or other hostile environments
