' '' the intelligentsia 's task for reconstruction of society '' he is buried next to zaynab bint ali , the granddaughter of the islamic prophet muhammad , and the daughter of ali , in damascus , where iranian pilgrims often visit shariati believed shia should not merely await the return of the 12th imam , but should actively work to hasten his return by fighting for social justice , '' even to the point of embracing martyrdom , '' saying '' every day is ashoura , every place is the karbala '' in 1962 , he continued studying sociology and the history of religions in paris , and followed the courses of islamic scholar louis massignon , jacques berque and the sociologist georges gurvitch he believed that the most learned members of the ulema ( clergy ) should play a leadership role in guiding society , because they best understand how to administer an islamic value system based on the teachings of the prophets of god and the 12 shia twelver imams '' our mosques , the revolutionary left and our preachers , '' he declared , '' work for the benefit of the deprived people and against the lavish and lush shariati , who was the fan of georges gurvitch in his analysis of sociology , believed that there was no special pattern for the analysis of social affairs and historical events however , shariati gave a critique of the historical development of religion and the modern philosophical and ideological movements and their relationship to both private ownership and the emergence of the machine '' shariati 's works were highly influenced by the third worldism that he encountered as a student in paris—ideas that class war and revolution would bring about a just and classless society—from one side , and the epistemic decolonisation thinking of his time from the other side therefore , he suggested to think of reason as the axiom for understanding the other sources namely the holy book or quran , ḥadīth ( 'tradition ' ) , sīra ( prophetic biography ) and ijmāʿ ( consensus ) ali shariati ( ali masharati ) was born in 1933 in mazinan , a suburb of sabzevar , in northeastern iran but we have to pay attention to the point that the image of shariati is not such that some revolutionary groups , in early days of islamic republic of iran , attributed to him in his years at the teacher 's training college in mashhad , shariati came into contact with young people who were from less privileged economic classes of society , and for the first time saw the poverty and hardship that existed in iran during that period his articles from this period for the mashhad daily newspaper , khorasan , display his developing eclecticism and acquaintance with the ideas of modernist thinkers such as jamal-al-din afghani , sir allama muhammad iqbal of pakistan , among muslims , and sigmund freud and alexis carrel in fact , private ownership and the emergence of the machine , if considered one of two curves of history , belong to the second period of history he insisted on the concepts of knowledge and time along with the holy book and tradition , and stressed the important role of methodology and changing of viewpoint the aim of government in the philosophy of syasat is to change social foundations , institutions and even all the norms of society namely culture , morality and desires etc he believed in the earthly religion and in the social context in which the meaning of society is construed he died three weeks later in a southampton hospital under '' mysterious circumstances '' , although in ali rahnema 's biography of shariati , he is said to have died of a fatal heart attack he believed that in the modern era , the appearance of the machine was the second most fundamental change in the human condition he said he was concerned with the historical and social tawhid , not with the truth of the quran or of muhammad or ali scott , pieces of the game : the human drama of americans held hostage in iran , peachtree publ ( 1984 ) , p mottahedeh , roy , the mantle of the prophet : religion and politics in iran , p he attempted to explain and offer solutions for the problems faced by muslim societies through traditional islamic principles interwoven with , and understood from , the point of view of modern sociology and philosophy he argued that the role of the clergy was to guide society in accordance with islamic values to advance human beings towards reaching their highest potential—not to provide/serve the hedonistic desires of individuals as in the west according to hamid elgar , shariati was the number one ideologue of the islamic revolution shariati developed the idea of the social , cultural and historical contingencies of religious knowledge in sociology conversely , sharia places the human , not the economy , as the foundation and origin of society in 1947 , he opened the centre for the propagation of islamic truths in mashhad , in khorasan province social theorist asef bayat has recorded his observations as a witness and participant in the iranian revolution of 1979 shariati not only was not the opposition of mullahs but rather he believes in the currents of mullahs in iran '' my father , '' recalls bayat , '' barely literate , had his own copies '' of shariati 's works it seems that his eagerness to explore socialism began with the translation of the book abu zarr : the god-worshipping socialist by the egyptian thinker abdul hamid jowdat-al-sahar ( : ar : عبد الحميد جودة السحار ) according to shariati , human history is composed of two stages , the stage of collectivity and the stage of private property
