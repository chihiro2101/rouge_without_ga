the term cabriolet originated from a carriage cabriolet : '' a light , two-wheeled , one-horse carriage with a folding top , capable of seating two persons '' , however the term is also used to describe other convertibles these days examples of early cars with roofs include the phaeton ( a two-seat car with a temporary roof ) , the brougham or a coupé de ville ( having an enclosed passenger compartment at the rear , while the driver sat in front either in the open ) or the landaulet ( where the driver has a fixed roof and the passenger compartment has a folding roof ) united states automakers manufactured a broad range of models during the 1950s and 1960s & nbsp ; – from economical compact-sized models such as the rambler american and the studebaker lark , to the more expensive models such as the packard caribbean , oldsmobile 98 , and imperial by chrysler during the 1970s , popularity of convertibles was severely reduced by the increased travel speeds on roads ( resulting in more wind and noise for occupants ) and proposed vehicle crash safety standards in the united states by 1955 , the most popular materials were latex and butyl rubber fabrics that each accounted for around 35 % of the convertible top weight , with others included vinyl ( 12 % ) , jute ( 8 % ) , and rayon and acrylic fibers ( orlon ) , amounting to about 1 % each in the compositions improvements in canvas tops have rendered the detachable hardtop less common in recent years , in part because the top can not be stored in the vehicle when not in use , requiring a garage or other storage facility a retractable hardtop — also known as '' coupé convertible '' or '' coupé cabriolet '' — is a car with an automatically operated , self-storing hardtop ( as opposed to the textile-based roof used by traditional convertibles ) traditionally , the rear window in a soft-top was made from plastic ; however , more recently some convertibles have used glass for the rear window modern safety features specifically for convertibles include : roll over protection structure with pyrotechnics roll hoops hidden behind the rear seats that deploy under rollover conditions heated rear window ( for improved visibility ) boron steel-reinforced a-pillars safety cage construction & nbsp ; – a horseshoe-like structure around the passenger compartment & nbsp ; door-mounted side-impact airbag which inflates upward ( instead of downward like the typical curtain airbag ) to provide head protection even with an open window convertibles have offered numerous iterations that fall between the first mechanically simple but attention-demanding fabric tops to highly complex modern retractable hardtops : roadster : a roadster ( also called spider or spyder ) is an open two-seat car with emphasis on sporting appearance or character the difference is that a convertible often has the b-pillar , c-pillar and other bodywork removed , however the cabrio-coach retains all bodywork to the top of the door frames and just replaces the roof skin with a retractable fabric panel an advantage of a cabrio coach is that retaining more of the car 's original structure means that structural rigidity is higher ( or the vehicle weight is lower ) than traditional cabriolets fixed-profile : in contrast to convertibles where the entire bodywork above the beltline ( doors , roof , side pillars , side bodywork ) is replaced with a folding or retractable roof , the fixed profile convertible retain portions of fixed bodywork including the doors , side pillars , and side elements of the roof & mdash ; while a center fabric portion slides back and accordions at the rear as an example , citroën 's 1948 citroën 2cv featured rigid bodysides and two doors on each side , along with a sunroof that rolled back on itself and extended to the rear bumper in place of a separate trunk lid other fixed-profile convertibles include the 1957 autobianchi bianchina , 1957 vespa 400 , 1950 nash rambler landau convertible coupe , the nissan figaro ( 1991 ) , the jaguar xj-s ( 1983 ) and the 1957 fiat 500 and its 2007 fiat 500 successor produced by french coachbuilding specialist heuliez , the macarena 's top can be folded in 60 seconds , with a steel reinforcing beam behind the front seats incorporating lcd screens for the rear passengers into the crossmember other names include cabriolet/coupé milord ( or just milord ) , calash ( from calèche ) , folding head dhc , three-position drop-head coupé , or cabriolet toit de 3 positions file:1936 packard custom convertible victoria - lebaron - fvl.jpg 1936 packard one-twenty convertible victoria with the top in the semi-open ( second ) position file:1950-nash-001.jpg fixed-profile nash motors circa 1950 file : jaguar xk8 cabriolet rear 20070520.jpg jaguar xk circa 2008 , with heatable glass rear window and fully automatic cloth top with integral top-concealing rigid tonneau file:1966 mercedes-benz 230sl convertible ( 10560521576 ) file : volkswagen new beetle cabriolet red iaa 2003.jpg volkswagen new beetle circa 2003 , with raised textile ( cloth ) convertible top featuring interior headliner , an acoustic insulation layer , and heatable glass rear window file : porsche boxster hr silver.jpg porsche boxster circa 2004 , with detachable clear plastic windblocker and a z-fold top , automatically raiseable in 12 seconds and optional detachable aluminum hardtop ( not shown ) file : citroen c3 pluriel rear 20071104.jpg citroën c3 circa 2007 , a multiconfigurable convertible with roll-back textile roof and removable rigid sidebars file : fiat 500c 1.2 8v lounge – heckansicht , 16
