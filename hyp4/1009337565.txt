this position gave way in time to a less uncompromising but formal approach , according to which , for example , the court would invalidate a state tax levied on gross receipts from interstate commerce , or upon the '' freight carried '' in interstate commerce , but would allow a tax merely measured by gross receipts from interstate commerce as long as the tax was formally imposed upon franchises , or '' 'in lieu of all taxes upon ( the taxpayer 's ) property , ' '' dissenting from this formal approach in 1927 , justice stone remarked that it was '' too mechanical , too uncertain in its application , and too remote from actualities , to be of value in overruling prior decisions which struck down privilege taxes per se , the court noted the following , in what has become a central component of commerce clause state taxation jurisprudence : we note again that no claim is made that the activity is not sufficiently connected to the state to justify a tax , or that the tax is not fairly related to benefits provided the taxpayer , or that the tax discriminates against interstate commerce , or that the tax is not fairly apportioned application of the dormant commerce clause to state taxation is another manifestation of the court 's holdings that the commerce clause prevents a state from retreating into economic isolation or jeopardizing the welfare of the nation as a whole , as it would do if it were free to place burdens on the flow of commerce across its borders that commerce wholly within those borders would not bear if marshall was suggesting that the power over interstate commerce is an exclusive federal power , the dormant commerce clause doctrine eventually developed very differently : it treats regulation that does not discriminate against or unduly burden interstate commerce as a concurrent power , rather than an exclusive federal power , and it treats regulation that does so as an exclusive federal power , marshall wrote : '' we do not think that the state act empowering the black bird creek marsh company to place a dam across the creek , can , under all the circumstances of the case , be considered as repugnant to the power to regulate commerce in its dormant state , or as being in conflict with any law passed on the subject the court faulted justice antonin scalia 's criticism of the dormant commerce clause doctrine by saying that he failed to '' explain why , under his interpretation of the constitution , the import-export clause would not lead to the same result that we reach under the dormant commerce clause '' on the other hand , when a law is '' directed to legitimate local concerns , with effects upon interstate commerce that are only incidental '' , that is , where other legislative objectives are credibly advanced and there is no patent discrimination against interstate trade , the court has adopted a much more flexible approach , the general contours of which were outlined in pike v ) , 1995 ) , the court explained : if the state activity constitutes '' regulation '' of interstate commerce , then the court must proceed to a second inquiry : whether the activity regulates evenhandedly with only '' incidental '' effects on interstate commerce , or discriminates against interstate commerce curtis wrote for the court : '' either absolutely to affirm , or deny that the nature of this commerce power requires exclusive legislation by congress , is to lose sight of the nature of the subjects of this power , and to assert concerning all of them , what is really applicable but to a part 432 , 493 ( 1941 ) ( arguing that historical evidence '' supports the view that , as to the restricted field which was deemed at the time to constitute regulation of commerce , the grant of power to the federal government presupposed the withdrawal of authority pari passu from the states the court 's taxation decisions thus '' reflected a central concern of the framers that was an immediate reason for calling the constitutional convention : the conviction that in order to succeed , the new union would have to avoid the tendencies toward economic balkanization that had plagued relations among the colonies and later among the states under the articles of confederation in this case the dormant commerce clause is no longer '' dormant '' and the issue is a commerce clause issue , requiring a determination of whether congress has approved , preempted , or left untouched the state law at issue unless we can conclude on the whole record that '' the total effect of the law as a safety measure in reducing accidents and casualties is so slight or problematical as not to outweigh the national interest in keeping interstate commerce free from interferences which seriously impede it '' we must uphold the statute in order to determine whether a law violates a so-called '' dormant '' aspect of the commerce clause , the court first asks whether it discriminates on its face against interstate commerce if it was intended to forbid the states from making any regulations of commerce , it is difficult to account for the omission to prohibit it , when that prohibition has been so carefully and distinctly inserted in relation to other powers for example , when a state is contracting for the construction of a building or selling maps to state parks , rather than passing laws governing construction or dictating the price of state park maps , it is acting '' in the market '' if discrimination is established , the burden shifts to the state or local government to show that the local benefits of the statute outweigh its discriminatory effects , and that the state or municipality lacked a nondiscriminatory alternative that could have adequately protected the relevant local interests the supreme court held that '' a state 's preference for domestic commerce over foreign commerce is inconsistent with the commerce clause even if the state 's own economy is not a direct beneficiary of the discrimination the court explained that '' it was not the purpose of the commerce clause to relieve those engaged in interstate commerce from their just share of state tax burden even though it increases the cost of doing the business on these occasions , the supreme court has '' struggled ( to put it nicely ) to develop a set of rules by which we may preserve a national market without needlessly intruding upon the states ' police powers , each exercise of which no doubt has some effect on the commerce of the nation the supreme court found that while the law was not infirm because of the dormant commerce clause , it violated the privileges and immunities clause of article iv of the constitution james madison believed that the mere existence of the commerce clause would bar states from imposing any duty of tonnage : '' madison was more and more convinced that the regulation of commerce was in its nature indivisible and ought to be wholly under one authority the court there explained : appellant 's attack is based solely on decisions of this court holding that a tax on the '' privilege '' of engaging in an activity in the state may not be applied to an activity that is part of interstate commerce '' the fact that the burden of a state regulation falls on some interstate companies does not , by itself establish a claim of discrimination against interstate commerce , '' the court wrote bittker , regulation of interstate and foreign commerce ยง 6.01a , at 6 & ndash ; 5 ( '' the boundaries of the state 's off-limits area are , and always have been , enveloped in a haze in the first , a tax imposed by the state of virginia on american business concerns operating within the state was struck down because it was a business privilege tax imposed on the privilege of doing business in interstate commerce because the state was not '' regulating '' the market , its economic activity was not subject to the anti-discrimination principles underlying the dormant commerce clause & mdash ; and the state could impose different paperwork burdens on out-of-state processors on september 15 , 1787 , the framers of the constitution debated in philadelphia whether to guarantee states the ability to lay duties of tonnage without congressional interference so that the states could finance the clearing of harbors and the building of lighthouses the spector rule ( against privilege taxes ) had come to operate only as a rule of draftsmanship , and served only to distract the courts and parties from their inquiry into whether the challenged tax produced results forbidden by the commerce clause justice anthony kennedy has written that : '' the central rationale for the rule against discrimination is to prohibit state or municipal laws whose object is local economic protectionism , laws that would excite those jealousies and retaliatory measures the constitution was designed to prevent thus regulation designed to implement public health and safety , or serve other legitimate state interests , but impact interstate commerce as an incident to that purpose , are subject to a test akin to the rational basis test , a minimum level of scrutiny '' nothing in the purposes animating the commerce clause prohibits a state , in the absence of congressional action , from participating in the market and exercising the right to favor its own citizens over others in addition to satisfying the four-prong test in complete auto transit , the supreme court has held state taxes which burden international commerce can not create a substantial risk of multiple taxations and must not prevent the federal government from '' speaking with one voice when regulating commercial relations with foreign governments '' '' and , the court made it plain , that the problem with clarkstown 's ordinance was that it created a local processing requirement protective of a local private processing company : in this light , the flow control ordinance is just one more instance of local processing requirements that we long have held invalid the history of commerce clause jurisprudence evidences a distinct difference in approach where the state is seeking to exercise its public health and safety powers , on the one hand , as opposed to attempting to regulate the flow of commerce in its early stages , the court held the view that interstate commerce was wholly immune from state taxation '' in any form '' , '' even though the same amount of tax should be laid on ( intrastate ) commerce '' when a state statute regarding safety matters applies equally to interstate and intrastate commerce , the courts are generally reluctant to invalidate it even if it may have some impact on interstate commerce '' the commerce clause significantly limits the ability of states and localities to regulate or otherwise burden the flow of interstate commerce , but it does not elevate free trade above all other values thus , in a dormant commerce clause case , a court is initially concerned with whether the law facially discriminates against out-of-state actors or has the effect of favoring in-state economic interests over out-of-state interests similarly , congress has the power itself under the commerce clause to regulate and sanction states acting as '' market participants '' , but it lacks power to legislate in ways that violate article iv if the challenging party can not show that the statute is discriminatory , then it must demonstrate that the statute places a burden on interstate commerce that '' is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits in pike , the court explained that a state regulation having only '' incidental '' effects on interstate commerce '' will be upheld unless the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits '' '' considering an equal protection clause challenge , the iowa supreme court held that the use of the federal government 's definitions of income were convenient for the state and was '' rationally related to the goal of administrative efficiency '' the '' market participation exception '' to the dormant commerce clause does not give states unlimited authority to favor local interests , because limits from other laws and constitutional limits still apply '' during the transition period , some taxes were upheld based on a careful review of the actual economic impact of the tax , and other taxes were reviewed based on the kind of tax involved , whether the tax had a nefarious impact on commerce or not as with the court 's application of the dormant commerce clause to discriminatory regulation , the pre-new deal court attempted to apply a formalistic approach to state taxation alleged to interfere with interstate commerce one court has written as follows : not surprisingly , the court 's effort to preserve a national market has , on numerous occasions , come into conflict with the states ' traditional power to '' legislate on all subjects relating to the health , life , and safety of their citizens over the years , the supreme court has consistently held that the language of the commerce clause contains a further , negative command prohibiting certain state taxation even when congress has failed to legislate on the subject the dormant commerce clause is not a roving license for federal courts to decide what activities are appropriate for state and local government to undertake , and what activities must be the province of private market competition the exact dividing line between the two interests , the right of states to exercise regulatory control over their public health and safety , and the interest of the national government in unfettered interstate commerce is not always easy to discern '' in concurrence , justice william johnson was even more emphatic that the constitution is '' altogether in favor of the exclusive grants to congress of power over commerce the party challenging the validity of a state statute or municipal ordinance bears the burden of showing that it discriminates against , or places some burden on , interstate commerce this rule looks only to the fact that the incidence of the tax is the '' privilege of doing business '' ; it deems irrelevant any consideration of the practical effect of the tax south-central timber holds that the market-participant doctrine is limited in allowing a state to impose burdens on commerce within the market in which it is a participant , but allows it to go no

doctrine that can permit state laws or actions that otherwise violate the dormant commerce clause to survive court challenges the supreme court stated , '' when a state or local government enters the market as a participant it is not subject to the restraints of the commerce clause in short , it was as if the authors of the ordinance had gone to a treatise on the commerce clause and intentionally chosen a device which had been traditionally prohibited '' the word '' dormant '' , in connection with the commerce clause , originated in dicta of chief justice john marshall
