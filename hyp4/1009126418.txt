: — edward ii by christopher marlowe : : according to legend , isabella of france and roger mortimer , 1st earl of march famously plotted to murder edward ii of england in such a way as not to draw blame on themselves , sending a famous order in latin which , depending on where the comma was inserted , could mean either '' do not be afraid to kill edward ; it is good , '' which can mean either edward , killing him , or being afraid to kill him is good ; or '' do not kill edward ; it is good to fear , '' which could mean that either edward or killing him is good to fear — lola by ray davies : :can mean '' lola and i are both glad i 'm a man '' , or '' i 'm glad lola and i are both men '' , or '' i 'm glad i 'm a man , and lola is also glad to be a man '' ben zimmer , '' on language : crash blossoms '' , new york times magazine , january 27 , 2010 online text the columbia journalism review regularly reprints such headlines in its '' the lower case '' column , and has collected them in the anthologies '' squad helps dog bite victim '' gloria cooper , ed significantly enough , structural ambiguities may be created by design when one understands the kinds of syntactic structures that will lead to ambiguity , however for the respective interpretations to work , they must be compatible with semantic and pragmatic contextual factors sometimes , local ambiguities can result in garden path sentence , in which a structurally sound sentence is difficult to interpret because one interpretation of the ambiguous region is not the ultimate coherent interpretation : : can mean that john , using a telescope , saw a man on a mountain , or john saw a man on a mountain , with a mountain holding a telescope , or john seeing a man with a telescope results of many experiments tracking the eye-movements of subjects has demonstrated that it is just as difficult to process a globally ambiguous statement ( 1 ) as an unambiguous statement ( 2 and 3 ) because information before the ambiguity does not provide a strong bias for either syntactic possibility according to the reanalysis model , processing difficulty occurs once the reader has realized that their sentence analysis is false ( with regards to the already adopted syntactic structure ) , and they must then return and reevaluate the structure the sentence may be parsed as either : '' british left-leaning politicians talk at length about the falklands '' or '' the british left cakes behind on the falklands '' in this example , the baby could be wrapped in the green blanket or the woman could be using the green blanket as an instrument to hold the baby as in constraint-based theories , there is no restriction on the sources of information that can provide support for the different analyses of an ambiguous structure ; hence it is unrestricted — henry vi ( 1.4.30 ) , by william shakespeare : :amphiboly occurs frequently in poetry , sometimes owing to the alteration of the natural order of words for metrical reasons he denotes by it a confusion of the notions of the pure understanding with the perceptions of experience , and a consequent ascription to the latter of what belongs only to the former a detailed discussion of syntactic ambiguity differentiating syntactic ambiguity ( structural ambiguity ) from other types of ambiguity '' aristotle writes about an influence of ambiguities on arguments and also about an influence of ambiguities depending on either combination or division of words : immanuel kant employs the term '' amphiboly '' in a sense of his own , as he has done in the case of other philosophical words in the model , the alternative structures of a syntactic ambiguity are engaged in a race , with the structure that is constructed fastest being adopted while adults tend to have a higher working memory span , they sometimes spend more time resolving the ambiguity but tend to be more accurate in their final interpretation the unrestricted race model states that analysis is affected prior to the introduction of ambiguity and affects which meaning is adopted ( based on probability ) before multiple analyses are able to be introduced the more sources of information support a syntactic analysis and the stronger the support is , the more likely this analysis will be constructed first more than one movie has used the comic line '' the peasants are revolting '' , which allows an interpretation of revolting as both a verb or adjective in syntactic ambiguity , the same sequence of words is interpreted as having different syntactic structures for low reading span adults who had the worst verbal working memory , the latency of response took longer to process the sentences with the reduced relative cause compared to the relative clause and had no contribution from animacy
