the main difference between the effects of single and multiple scattering is that single scattering can usually be treated as a random phenomenon , whereas multiple scattering , somewhat counterintuitively , can be modeled as a more deterministic process because the combined results of a large number of scattering events tend to average out because the location of a single scattering center is not usually well known relative to the path of the radiation , the outcome , which tends to depend strongly on the exact incoming trajectory , appears random to an observer in this case , the atom 's exact position relative to the path of the electron is unknown and would be unmeasurable , so the exact trajectory of the electron after the collision can not be predicted with multiple scattering , the randomness of the interaction tends to be averaged out by a large number of scattering events , so that the final path of the radiation appears to be a deterministic distribution of intensity scattering also includes the interaction of billiard balls on a table , the rutherford scattering ( or angle change ) of alpha particles by gold nuclei , the bragg scattering ( or diffraction ) of electrons and x-rays by a cluster of atoms , and the inelastic scattering of a fission fragment as it traverses a thin foil more precisely , scattering consists of the study of how solutions of partial differential equations , propagating freely '' in the distant past '' , come together and interact with one another or with a boundary condition , and then propagate away '' to the distant future '' surfaces described as white owe their appearance to multiple scattering of light by internal or surface inhomogeneities in the object , for example by the boundaries of transparent microscopic crystals that make up a stone or by the microscopic fibers in a sheet of paper light scattering can also create color without absorption , often shades of blue , as with the sky ( rayleigh scattering ) , the human blue iris , and the feathers of some birds ( prum et al models of light scattering can be divided into three domains based on a dimensionless size parameter , α which is defined as : : \alpha \pi d_\text / \lambda , where πd p is the circumference of a particle and λ is the wavelength of incident radiation in the medium based on the value of α , these domains are : : α ≪ 1 : rayleigh scattering ( small particle compared to wavelength of light ) ; : α ≈ 1 : mie scattering ( particle about the same size as wavelength of light , valid only for spheres ) ; : α ≫ 1 : geometric scattering ( particle much larger than wavelength of light ) rayleigh scattering is a process in which electromagnetic radiation ( including light ) is scattered by a small spherical volume of variant refractive indexes , such as a particle , bubble , droplet , or even a density fluctuation the inherent scattering that radiation undergoes passing through a pure gas is due to microscopic density fluctuations as the gas molecules move around , which are normally small enough in scale for rayleigh 's model to apply the degree of scattering varies as a function of the ratio of the particle diameter to the wavelength of the radiation , along with many other factors including polarization , angle , and coherence however , electromagnetic radiation scattered by moving scattering centers does undergo a doppler shift , which can be detected and used to measure the velocity of the scattering center/s in forms of techniques such as lidar and radar
