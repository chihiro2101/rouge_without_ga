examples of subspeciality training in radiology include abdominal imaging , thoracic imaging , cross-sectional/ultrasound , mri , musculoskeletal imaging , interventional radiology , neuroradiology , interventional neuroradiology , paediatric radiology , nuclear medicine , emergency radiology , breast imaging and women 's imaging the american board of radiology ( abr ) administers professional certification in diagnostic radiology , radiation oncology and medical physics as well as subspecialty certification in neuroradiology , nuclear radiology , pediatric radiology and vascular and interventional radiology ct scanning has become the test of choice in diagnosing some urgent and emergent conditions , such as cerebral hemorrhage , pulmonary embolism ( clots in the arteries of the lungs ) , aortic dissection ( tearing of the aortic wall ) , appendicitis , diverticulitis , and obstructing kidney stones they take an intakt bone image sample ( region of interest , roi , reference site ) and a sample of the implantation site ( second roi , test site ) can be assessed numerically/objectively to what extent the implantation site imitates a healthy bone and how advanced is the process of bone regeneration it is also possible to check whether the bone healing process is influenced by some systemic factors in 2000 , the society of interventional radiology ( sir ) created a program named '' clinical pathway in ir '' , which modified the '' holman pathway '' that was already accepted by the american board of radiology to including training in ir ; this was accepted by abr but was not widely adopted while many countries have an interventional radiology society , there is also the european-wide cardiovascular and interventional radiological society of europe , whose aim is to support teaching , science , research and clinical practice in the field by hosting meetings , educational workshops and promoting patient safety initiatives the use of mri is currently contraindicated for patients with pacemakers , cochlear implants , some indwelling medication pumps , certain types of cerebral aneurysm clips , metal fragments in the eyes and some metallic hardware due to the powerful magnetic fields and strong fluctuating radio signals to which the body is exposed in 2006 sir proposed a pathway resulting in certification in ir as a speciality ; this was eventually accepted by the abr in 2007 and was presented to the american board of medical specialities ( abms ) in 2009 , which rejected it because it did not include enough diagnostic radiology ( dr ) training mri uses strong magnetic fields to align atomic nuclei ( usually hydrogen protons ) within body tissues , then uses a radio signal to disturb the axis of rotation of these nuclei and observes the radio frequency signal generated as the nuclei return to their baseline states no ionizing radiation is involved , but the quality of the images obtained using ultrasound is highly dependent on the skill of the person ( ultrasonographer ) performing the exam and the patient 's body size in pet scanning , a radioactive , biologically active substance , most often 18f-fdg , is injected into a patient and the radiation emitted by the patient is detected to produce multiplanar images of the body veterinary radiologists are veterinarians who specialize in the use of x-rays , ultrasound , mri and nuclear medicine for diagnostic imaging or treatment of disease in animals the x-rays that pass through the patient are filtered through a device called a grid or x-ray filter , to reduce scatter , and strike an undeveloped film , which is held tightly to a screen of light-emitting phosphors in a light-tight cassette interventional radiology ( ir or sometimes vir for vascular and interventional radiology ) is a subspecialty of radiology in which minimally invasive procedures are performed using image guidance additionally , in specific circumstances , air can be used as a contrast agent for the gastrointestinal system and carbon dioxide can be used as a contrast agent in the venous system ; in these cases , the contrast agent attenuates the x-ray radiation less than the surrounding tissues furthermore , the society provides an examination , the european board of interventional radiology ( ebir ) , which is a highly valuable qualification in interventional radiology based on the european curriculum and syllabus for ir . radiocontrast agents are usually administered by swallowing or injecting into the body of the patient to delineate anatomy and functioning of the blood vessels , the genitourinary system , or the gastrointestinal tract ( gi tract ) radiology is a field in medicine that has expanded rapidly after 2000 due to advances in computer technology , which is closely linked to modern imaging techniques the x-rays are projected through the body onto a detector ; an image is formed based on which rays pass through ( and are detected ) versus those that are absorbed or scattered in the patient ( and thus are not detected ) currently , a shortage of radiologists in the uk has created opportunities in all specialities , and with the increased reliance on imaging , demand is expected to increase in the future after achieving a certificate of completion of training ( cct ) , many fellowship posts exist in specialities such as neurointervention and vascular intervention , which would allow the ioctor to work as an interventional radiologist these radiocontrast agents strongly absorb or scatter x-rays , and in conjunction with the real-time imaging , allow demonstration of dynamic processes , such as peristalsis in the digestive tract or blood flow in arteries and veins teleradiology is the transmission of radiographic images from one location to another for interpretation by an appropriately trained professional , usually a radiologist or reporting radiographer a clot , embedded deep in one of the inner veins of the legs , can be found via ultrasound before it dislodges and travels to the lungs , resulting in a potentially fatal pulmonary embolism at the transmission station , plain radiography are passed through a digitizing machine before transmission , while ct , mri , ultrasound and nuclear medicine scans can be sent directly , as they are already digital data radiographic images , fluoroscopy , and ultrasound modalities are used for guidance , and the primary instruments used during the procedure are specialized needles and catheters to be a trained interventionalist in the united states , an individual completes a five-year residency in radiology and a one- or two-year fellowship in ir the proposal was reworked , at the same time that overall dr training was being revamped , and a new proposal that would lead to a dual dr/ir specialization was presented to the abms and was accepted in 2012 and eventually was implemented in 2014 laws and regulations concerning the use of teleradiology vary among the states , with some requiring a license to practice medicine in the state sending the radiologic exam pet images can be combined ( or '' fused '' ) with anatomic ( ct ) imaging , to more accurately localize pet findings and thereby improve diagnostic accuracy the principal imaging devices are the gamma camera and the pet scanner , which detect the radiation emitted by the tracer in the body and display it as an image in ct , an x-ray tube opposite an x-ray detector ( or detectors ) in a ring-shaped apparatus rotate around a patient , producing a computer-generated cross-sectional image ( tomogram ) with rapid administration of intravenous contrast during the ct scan , these fine detail images can be reconstructed into three-dimensional ( 3d ) images of carotid , cerebral , coronary or other arteries because ultrasound imaging techniques do not employ ionizing radiation to generate images ( unlike radiography , and ct scans ) , they are generally considered safer and are therefore more common in obstetrical imaging continuing improvements in ct technology , including faster scanning times and improved resolution , have dramatically increased the accuracy and usefulness of ct scanning , which may partially account for increased use in medical diagnosis certification may also be obtained from the american osteopathic board of radiology ( aobr ) and the american board of physician specialties with computer processing , the information can be displayed as axial , coronal and sagittal images ( single-photon emission computed tomography - spect or positron-emission tomography - pet ) during the first year of training , radiology trainees are expected to pass the first part of the fellowship of the royal college of radiologists ( frcr ) exam
