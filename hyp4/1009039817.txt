450px in the air brake 's simplest form , called the straight air system , compressed air pushes on a piston in a cylinder the principal problem with the straight air braking system is that any separation between hoses and pipes causes loss of air pressure and hence the loss of the force applying the brakes in order to design a system without the shortcomings of the straight air system , westinghouse invented a system wherein each piece of railroad rolling stock was equipped with an pressure tank and a triple valve , also known as a control valve thumb unlike the straight air system , the westinghouse system uses a reduction in air pressure in the train line to indirectly apply the brakes in his patent application , westinghouse refers to his 'triple-valve device ' because of the three component valvular parts comprising it : the diaphragm-operated poppet valve feeding reservoir air to the brake cylinder , the reservoir charging valve , and the brake cylinder release valve if the pressure in the train line is lower than that of the reservoir , the brake cylinder exhaust portal is closed and air from the car 's reservoir is fed into the brake cylinder if the pressure in the train line is higher than that of the reservoir , the triple valve connects the train line to the reservoir feed , causing the air pressure in the reservoir to increase as the pressure in the train line and that of the reservoir equalize , the triple valve closes , causing the air in the reservoir to be sealed in , and the brake cylinder is not pressurized when the engine operator applies the brake by operating the locomotive brake valve , the train line vents to atmosphere at a controlled rate , reducing the train line pressure and in turn triggering the triple valve on each car to feed air into its brake cylinder the subsequent increase of train line pressure causes the triple valves on each car to discharge the contents of the brake cylinder to the atmosphere , releasing the brakes and recharging the reservoirs the westinghouse system is thus fail safe & mdash ; any failure in the train line , including a separation ( '' break-in-two '' ) of the train , will cause a loss of train line pressure , causing the brakes to be applied and bringing the train to a stop , thus preventing a runaway train in the event the train needs to make an emergency stop , the engine operator can make an '' emergency application , '' which will rapidly vent all of the brake pipe pressure to atmosphere , resulting in a faster application of the train 's brakes normal service applications transfer air pressure from the service section to the brake cylinder , while emergency applications cause the triple valve to direct all air in both the sections of the dual-compartment reservoir to the brake cylinder , resulting in a 20 to 30 percent stronger application due to the length of trains and the small diameter of the brake pipe , the rate of reduction is highest near the front of the train ( in the case of an engine operator-initiated emergency application ) or near the break in the brake pipe ( in the case of loss of brake pipe integrity ) during normal service , the pressure in the brake pipe is never reduced to zero and in fact , the smallest reduction that will cause a satisfactory brake response is used to conserve brake pipe pressure , a blown hose ) , the train breaking-in-two and uncoupling air hoses , or the engineer moving the automatic brake valve to the emergency position , will cause an emergency brake ( train ) this '' straight air '' trainline was charged ( from reservoirs on each car ) and released by magnet valves on each car , controlled electrically by a 3 wire trainline , in turn controlled by an '' electro-pneumatic master controller '' in the controlling locomotive this controller compared the pressure in the straight air trainline with that supplied by a self lapping portion of the engineers valve , signaling all of the '' apply '' or '' release '' magnets valves in the train to open simultaneously , changing the pressure in the '' straight air '' trainline much more rapidly and evenly than possible by simply supplying air directly from the locomotive westinghouse 24rl air brake manual later systems replace the automatic air brake with an electrical wire which runs in a circle round the whole train and has to be kept energized to keep the brakes off more recent innovations are electronically controlled pneumatic brakes where the brakes of all the wagons ( cars ) and locomotives are connected by a kind of local area network , which allows individual control of the brakes on each wagon , and the reporting back of performance of each wagon 's brakes if the brakes must be applied before recharging has been completed , a larger brake pipe reduction will be required in order to achieve the desired amount of braking effort , as the system is starting out at a lower point of equilibrium ( lower overall pressure ) in the event of a loss of braking due to reservoir depletion , the engine driver may be able to regain control with an emergency brake application , as the emergency portion of each car 's dual-compartment reservoir should be fully charged & mdash ; it is not affected by normal service reductions however , if the brake pipe pressure is too low due to an excessive number of brake applications , an emergency application will not produce a large enough volume of air flow to trip the triple valves , leaving the engine driver with no means to stop the train this arrangement helps to reduce the above described pressure loss problems , and also reduces the time required for the brakes to release , since the brake pipe only has to recharge itself depending on the location of the air test , the repair facilities available , and regulations governing the number of inoperative brakes permitted in a train , the car may be set out for repair or taken to the next terminal where it can be repaired the modern air brake is not identical with the original airbrake as there have been slight changes in the design of the triple valve , which are not completely compatible between versions , and which must therefore be introduced in phases in a positive air system , a leak is quickly found due to the escaping pressurized air ; discovering a vacuum leak is more difficult , although it is easier to repair when found because a piece of rubber ( for example ) can just be tied around the leak and will be firmly held there by the vacuum
