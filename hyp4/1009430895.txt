finally , the series/1 provided a cost-effective method for remote support of the distributed mainframes using inexpensive ascii terminals and modems , or ibm pcs equipped with light pens ( emulating the 3278/9 terminals ) according to this document , there is still a series/1 that '' coordinates the operational functions of the united states ' nuclear forces , such as intercontinental ballistic missiles , nuclear bombers , and tanker support aircraft however , left in the hands of young marine corps programmers eager to explore the capabilities of their new equipment , the series/1 soon proved to be a valuable and flexible workhorse for all manner of tasks at all organizational levels although a cobol compiler was available as part of the software package sold to the marine corps with the series/1 , most class i and class ii systems development was in edl designed primarily as a source data automation ( sda ) device for the enhancement of input into 'class i ' logistics and personnel computer systems , the adpe-fmf series/1 provided the power of a minicomputer to the battalion/squadron commander the initial rollout of the equipment was on the west coast at camp pendleton in 1981 , where the 1st fssg information systems management office ( ismo ) was formed to develop software and support the new equipment series/1 computers were also utilized in the early development of gm 's manufacturing automation protocol ( map ) commercial applications of customized series/1 computers included an application by state farm as an intelligent remote terminal in agents ' offices the series/1 used for pos systems was short lived as it was quickly replaced by two ibm pc at computers running either ibm 3683 or ibm 4683 registers the deluxe corporation also used a bank of series/1 ibm 4956 computers for each check printing facility which handled the plant 's business and personal check sales orders and printing operations the 'class i ' systems were classified as mainframe systems – and the series/1 systems that provided field input to them – that were maintained at and distributed from the three cdpas a set of modules , called control program support ( cps ) , was linked with the application to provide task management , data processing input/output support and initial program loading for both disks and diskettes the kmart also used the series/1 computer initially for its kmart information network ( kin ) which handled the store 's ordering , invoicing , payroll , inventory , cash , and headquarters to store communications in this environment the series/1 provided customized interfaces to diverse ( and generally non-ibm ) minicomputer-based hospital systems using asynchronous or binary synchronous communications then commonly found in the laboratory , pharmacy , and other departments
