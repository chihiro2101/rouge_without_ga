in mammals , a nipple ( also called mammary papilla or teat ) is a small projection of skin containing the outlets for 15â€“20 lactiferous ducts arranged cylindrically around the tip the skin of the nipple is rich in a supply of special nerves that are sensitive to certain stimuli : these are slowly-adapting and rapidly-adapting cutaneous mechanoreceptors the rest of the drainage leaves the nipple and breast through infroclavicular , pectoral , or parasternal nodes since nipples change throughout the life span in men and women , the anatomy of the nipple can change and this change may be expected and considered normal the physiological purpose of nipples is to deliver milk to the infant , produced in the female mammary glands during lactation when the baby suckles or stimulates the nipple , oxytocin levels rise and small muscles in the breast contract and move the milk through the milk ducts the result of nipple stimulation by the newborn helps to move breast milk out through the ducts and to the nipple a good attachment is when the bottom of the areola ( the area around the nipple ) is in the baby 's mouth and the nipple is drawn back inside his or her mouth the nipple is poorly stimulated when the baby latches on too close to the tip of the nipple after the birth of the infant , the milk supply increases based upon the continuous and increasing stimulation of the nipple by the infant one reason for the development of cracked and sore nipples is the incorrect latching-on of the infant to the nipple if a nipple appears to be wedge-shaped , white and flattened , this may indicates that the attachment of the infant is not good and there is a potential of developing cracked nipples here are some reasons for nipple discharge : pregnancy recent breastfeeding rubbing on the area from a bra or t-shirt injury to the breast infection inflammation and clogging of the breast ducts noncancerous pituitary tumors small growth in the breast that is usually not cancer severe underactive thyroid gland ( hypothyroidism ) fibrocystic breast ( normal lumpiness in the breast ) use of certain medicines use of certain herbs , such as anise and fennel widening of the milk ducts sometimes , babies can have nipple discharge nipple discharge that is not normal is bloody , comes from only one nipple , or comes out on its own without squeezing or touching the nipple nipple discharge is more likely to be normal if it comes out of both nipples or happens when the nipples are squeezed this change can be of concern since puckering or retraction of the nipple can indicate an underlying change in breast tissue that can be cancerous symptoms of breast cancer can often be seen first by changes of the nipple and areola , although not all women have the same symptoms , and some people do not have any signs or symptoms at all warning signs can be : new lump in the nipple , or breast or armpit thickening or swelling of part of the breast , areola , or nipple irritation or dimpling of breast skin redness or flaky skin in the nipple area or the breast pulling in of the nipple or pain in the nipple area nipple discharge other than breast milk , including blood any change in the size or the shape of the breast or nipple pain in any area of the breast changes in the nipple are not necessarily symptoms or signs of breast cancer in these circumstances , the nipple itself can become infected with candida that is present in the mouth of the breastfeeding infant other infections can be transmitted through a break of the skin of the nipple and can infect the infant nipple bleb candida infection of the nipple eczema of the nipple inverted nipple staphylococcus infection of the nipple edematous areola herpes infection of the nipple reynaud phenomenon of the nipple flat nipple a nipple-sparing/subcutis mastectomy is a surgical procedure where breast tissue is removed , but the nipple and areola are preserved leder , the body in medical thought and practice , page 223 , springer science & business media , 1992 , a case in erie , pennsylvania concerning the exposure of breasts and nipple proceeded to the supreme court in the us west virginia 's regulation is very specific and is not likely to be misinterpreted , stating : '' the display of 'any portion of the cleavage of the human female breast exhibited by a dress , blouse , skirt , leotard , bathing suit , or other wearing apparel is permitted provided the areola is not exposed , in whole or in part instagram has a '' no nipples '' policy with exceptions : material that is not allowed includes '' some photos of female nipples , but photos of post-mastectomy scarring and women actively breastfeeding are allowed another recent development is the instagram page that invites users to post images of nipples from both sexes ; genderless_nipples , which displays close ups of both the nipples of men and women for the purpose of spotlighting what may be inconsistency filmmaker lina esco made a film entitled free the nipple , which is about '' laws against female toplessness or restrictions on images of female , but not male , nipples '' , which esco states is an example of sexism in society komisaruk 's study was the first to map the female genitals onto the sensory portion of the brain ; it indicates that sensation from the nipples travels to the same part of the brain as sensations from the vagina , clitoris and cervix , and that these reported orgasms are genital orgasms caused by nipple stimulation , and may be directly linked to the genital sensory cortex ( '' the genital area of the brain '' ) the word '' nipple '' most likely originates as a diminutive of neb , an old english word meaning '' beak '' , '' nose '' , or '' face '' , and which is of proto-germanic
