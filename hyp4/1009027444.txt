'' and elsewhere , he writes that science can not describe what it is like to be a thinker who conceives of the world from a particular subjective perspective '' 'death ' ( essay ) , thomas nagel , cup , 1979 note that the paragraph in the earlier 1970 version of the essay published in nous ; death author ( s ) : thomas nagel source : noûs , vol nagel repeatedly returns to the distinction between '' primary '' and '' secondary '' qualities , that is , between primary qualities of objects like mass and shape , that are mathematically and structurally describable independent of our sensory apparatuses , and secondary qualities like taste and color , which depend on our sensory apparatuses in the case of agent-relative reasons ( the successor to subjective reasons ) specifying the content of the reason makes essential reference back to the agent for whom it is a reason his critics have objected strongly to what they see as a misguided attempt to argue from a fact about how one represents the world ( trivially , one can only do so from his own point of view ) to a false claim about the world , that it somehow has first personal perspectives built into it in later discussions , nagel treats his former view as an incomplete attempt to convey the fact that there are distinct classes of reasons and values , and speaks instead of '' agent-relative '' and '' agent-neutral '' reasons part of the puzzlement here is because of the limitations of imagination : influenced by his princeton colleague , saul kripke , nagel believes that any type identity statement that identifies a physical state type with a mental state type would be , if true , logical truth in his 2012 book mind and cosmos , nagel argues against a materialism view of the emergence of life and consciousness , writing that the standard neo-darwinism view flies in the face of common sense the therapeutic or deflationary philosopher , influenced by the later philosophy of ludwig wittgenstein , reconciles people to the dependence of our worldview on our '' form of life '' nagel 's rationalism and tendency to present our human nature as a composite , structured around our capacity to reason , explains why he thinks that therapeutic or deflationary accounts of philosophy are simply complacent and that radical skepticism is , strictly speaking , irrefutable in '' what is it like to be a bat ? '' , nagel argues that consciousness has essential to it a subjective character , a what it is like aspect a person who denies the truth of this claim is committed , as in the case of a similar mistake about prudence , to a false view of him or herself despite nagel 's being an atheist and not a proponent of intelligent design ( id ) , his book was '' praised by creationists '' , according to the new york times earlier , in the possibility of altruism , he took the stance that if one 's reasons really are about intrinsic and timeless values then , qua subjective reason , one can only take them to be the guise of the reasons that there really are – the objective ones in addition , in his later work , nagel finds a rationale for so-called deontic constraints in a way scheffler could not '' he also said in his book the last word , '' i want atheism to be true and am made uneasy by the fact that some of the most intelligent and well-informed people i know are religious believers 1998 , '' reductionism and antireductionism '' , in the limits of reductionism in biology , novartis symposium 213 , john wiley & sons , pp now , it seems to people that the mental and the physical are irreducibly distinct but that is not a metaphysical insight , or an acknowledgment of an irreducible explanatory gap , but simply where people are at their present stage of understanding in this case the false view is that one 's reasons are irreducibly his , in a way that does not allow them to be reasons for anyone : nagel argues this commits such a person to the view that he or she can not make the same judgments about her own reasons third-personally that she can make first-personally like the british philosopher bernard williams , nagel believes that the rise of modern science has permanently changed how people think of the world and our place in it this position was primarily discussed by nagel in one of his most famous articles : '' what is it like to be a bat ? '' ( 1974 ) the most striking claim of the book is that there is a very close parallel between prudential reasoning in one 's own interests and moral reasons to act to further the interests of another person ) nagel is not a physicalist because he does not believe that an internal understanding of mental concepts shows them to have the kind of hidden essence that underpins a scientific identity in , say , chemistry he argues that scientific understanding 's attempt at an objective viewpoint -- a '' view from nowhere '' -- necessarily leaves out something essential when applied to the mind , which is inherently from a subjective point of view this is , however , a misunderstanding : nagel 's point is that there is a constraint on what it is to possess the concept of a mental state , namely , that one be directly acquainted with it we need not give an account of these goods here , except to observe that some of them , like perception , desire , activity , and thought , are so general as to be constitutive of human life the result is a hybrid ethical theory of the kind defended by nagel 's princeton phd student samuel scheffler in the rejection of consequentialism normally , people draw a distinction between that which people do and that which people fail to bring about , but this thesis , true of individuals , does not apply to the state , which is a collective agent because of the almost unbelievable fact that there is a world at all , and that we 're conscious beings who get to be in it , feelings its sensations , and interacting with it and other similarly improbable existers , agent-relative and agent-neutral ) emphasized in nagel 's later work are situated within a sidgwickian model in which one 's moral commitments are thought of objectively , such that one 's personal reasons and values are simply incomplete parts of an impersonal whole it would , of its nature , leave out what it is to be a thinker , and that , nagel believes , would be a falsely objectifying view nagel calls this '' dissociation '' and considers it a practical analogue of solipsism ( the philosophical idea that only one 's own mind is sure to exist ) '' nagel does not accept meyer 's conclusions but he endorsed meyer 's approach , and argued in mind and cosmos that meyer and other id proponents , david berlinski and michael behe , '' do not deserve the scorn with which they are commonly met
