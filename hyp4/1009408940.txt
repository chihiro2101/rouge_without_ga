raï is a type of algerian popular music that arose in the 1920s in the port city of oran , and that self-consciously ran counter to accepted artistic and social mores in the years just following world war i , the algerian city of oran—known as “ little paris ” —was a melting pot of various cultures , full of nightclubs and cabarets ; it was the place to go for a bawdy good time out of this milieu arose a group of male and female muslim singers called chioukhs and cheikhates , who rejected the refined , classical poetry of traditional algerian music instead , to the accompaniment of pottery drums and end-blown flutes , they sang about the adversity of urban life in a raw , gritty , sometimes vulgar , and inevitably controversial language that appealed especially to the socially and economically disadvantaged it drew its name from the algerian arabic word raï ( “ opinion ” or “ advice ” ) , which was typically inserted—and repeated—by singers to fill time as they formulated a new phrase of improvised lyrics by the early 1940s cheikha rimitti had emerged locally as a musical and linguistic luminary in the raï tradition , and she continued to be among the music ’ s most prominent performers into the 21st century another group of female social outcasts were called cheikhas , who were known for their alluring dress , hedonistic lyrics , and their display of a form of music that was influenced from meddhahates and zendani singers when first developed , raï was a hybrid blend of rural and cabaret musical genres , invented by and targeted toward distillery workers , peasants who had lost their land to european settlers , and other types of lower class citizens the geographical location of oran allowed for the spread of many cultural influences , allowing raï musicians to absorb an assortment of musical styles such as flamenco from spain , gnawa music , and french cabaret , allowing them to combine with the rhythms typical of arab nomads in the early 1930s , social issues afflicting the arab population in the colony , such as the disease of typhus , harassment and imprisonment by the colonial police , and poverty were prominent themes of raï lyrics '' arab noise and ramadan nights : raï , rap , and franco-maghrebi identities by jonathan xavier and renato rosaldo , 1 in the 1930s , raï , al-andalousm , and the egyptian classical style influenced the formation of wahrani , a musical style popularized by blaoui houari after independence in 1962 , however , the marxism government of the houari boumédienne regime , along with president ahmed ben bella , did not tolerate criticism from musicians such as saber , and suppression of raï and oranian culture ensued this marked the beginning of pop raï , which was performed by a later generation which adopted the title of cheb ( male ) or chaba ( female ) , meaning “ young , ” to distinguish themselves from the older musicians who continued to perform in the original style the added expense of producing lps as well as the technical aspects imposed on the medium by the music led to the genre being released almost exclusively onto cassette by the early 1980s , with a great deal of music having no lp counterpart at all and a very limited exposure on cd previously , the algerian government had opposed raï because of its sexually and culturally risqué topics , such as alcohol and consumerism , two subjects that were taboo to the traditional islamic culture he succeeded in getting the government to return passports to raï musicians and to allow raï to be recorded and performed in algeria , with government sponsorship , claiming it as a part of algerian cultural heritage this not only allowed the algerian government to financially gain from producing and releasing raï , but it allowed them to monitor the music and prevent the publication of '' unclean '' music and dance and still use it to benefit the algerian state 's image in the national world yet raï 's reputation as protest music stuck because the demonstrators adopted khaled 's song '' el harba wayn '' ( '' to flee , but where ? '' ) to aid their protesting : where has youth gone ? where are the brave ones ? the rich gorge themselves the poor work themselves to death the islamic charlatans show their true face the fundamentalists claimed that the musical genre still promoted sexuality , alcohol and western consumer culture , but critics of the fundamentalist viewpoint stated that fundamentalists and raï musicians were ultimately seeking converts from the same population , the youth , who often had to choose where they belonged between the two cultures with khaled no longer in algeria , musicians such as cheb tahar , cheb nasro , and cheb hasni began singing lover 's raï , a sentimental , pop-ballad form of raï music later in the decade , funk , hip hop , and other influences were added to raï , especially by performers like faudel and rachid taha , the latter of whom took raï music and fused it with rock according to authors gross , mcmurray , and swedenburg in their article '' arab noise and ramadan nights : raï , rap , and franco-maghrebi identity , '' raï musician chaba zahouania was forbidden by her family to perform or even appear in public '' arab noise and ramadan nights : raï , rap , and franco-maghrebi identities '' arab noise and ramadan nights : raï , rap , and franco-maghrebi identities '' diaspora 3:1 ( 1994 ) an example of this free expression is through the lyrics of cheb hasni in his song '' el berraka '' because when you 're drunk that 's the sort of idea that runs through your head !
