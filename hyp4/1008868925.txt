the roman frontier stretched for more than from the atlantic coast of northern britain , through europe to the black sea , and from there to the red sea and across north africa to the atlantic coast it is a striking example of the organization of a military zone and illustrates the defensive techniques and geopolitical strategies of ancient rome the antonine wall , a 60 & nbsp ;

benjamin isaac , the limits of empire : the roman army in the east ( oxford : oxford university press , revised edition 1992 ) this section of limes existed from the 1st to the 5th century ad and ran through the provinces of : britannia inferior britannia superior the limes in britain ( limes britannicus ) is on the territory of the present-day united kingdom in england , scotland and wales from the 1st to the 2nd century , the gask ridge and the stanegate , with their chains of roman camps and watchtowers , marked the northern boundary of britannia later the isthmuses in the north between the firth of forth and firth of clyde were guarded by the defences of the antonine wall and the line between the mouth of the tyne and solway firth by hadrian 's wall security and monitoring on the coasts in the west and southeast was achieved by camps and by chains of watchtowers or signal towers , both along the coastline and along main roads in the interior in the 3rd century , a separate military district , the litus saxonicum , was established on the british side of the english channel between the estuaries of the wash and the solent , to repel saxon pirates and plunderers monitoring and surveillance of the channel were the responsibility of the classis britannica and classis sambrica , whose headquarters were in locus quartensis ( port d'etaple ) , guarding the mouth of the river somme the units of comitatenses , limitanei and liburnaria in this area came under the command of three generals : count of the saxon shore ( count of the saxon shore ) dux belgicae secundae dux tractus armoricani et nervicani this limes was a river border ( limes ripa ) on the rhine , defended by a chain of camps , that ran from the north sea ( katwijk-brittenburg camp ) to vinxtbach ( opposite rheinbrohl fort on the upper germanic limes ) , forming the border between the roman provinces of germania inferior and germania superior each camp had its own river port or landing stage and a storage area , because the rhine not only formed the border but was also the most important transport and trade route in the region the control and surveillance of the waters of the north sea , the rhine estuary and the lower rhine was the responsibility of the classis germanica whose headquarters was in colonia claudia ara agrippinensium/cologne to the north , it bordered those parts of the roman province of rhaetia that lay north of the danube and guarded the eastern border of that part of germania superior that lay east of the rhine the northern border of rhaetia formed the pars superior ( upper part ) , the western border was the pars media ( central part ) with the fortified town of kempten and bases from vemania ( isny im allgäu ) to cassilacum ( memmingen ) ; the pars inferior ( lower part ) was the section between castra regina ( regensburg ) and batavis ( passau ) as early as the period 15 bc to about 70 ad , the border between rome and germania ran mostly along the line of the late antique danube-iller-rhine limes ( dirl ) before the romans advanced further north into the agri decumates because of troop withdrawals and massive barbarian invasions , the upper germanic-rhaetian limes were abandoned in the late 3rd century and the roman forces pulled the border back to the banks of the three rivers every camp had its own river port or landing stage and a storage area because the danube was not only border zone , but also the most important transport and trade route in the region this stretch of limes was in use from the 1st to the 5th centuries ad and helped to guard the provinces of : pannonia inferior pannonia the pannonian limes is situated on the territory of present-day austria , slovakia and hungary although this section of the frontier was relatively well protected by the danube river border or ripa , the roman military presence here was always exceptionally strong ( three military camps in pannonia , but only one in lower pannonia ) because especially after the abandonment of roman dacia in the late 3rd century , the pressure of migrant peoples from the east on this section of the limes intensified at the greatest extent of the roman empire , the southern border lay along the deserts of arabia in the middle east ( see romans in arabia ) and the sahara in north africa , which represented a natural barrier against expansion in africa romans controlled the area north of the sahara , from the atlantic ocean to egypt , with many sections of limes ( limes tripolitanus , limes numidiae , etc map of roman africa the fossatum africae ( '' african ditch '' ) of at least 750 & nbsp ; km controlled the southern borders of the empire and had many similarities of construction to hadrian 's wall fossatum at bou regreg in morocco although this would not have been within the scope of the proclamation of the codex theodosianus because at that time the province was not in africa , administratively speaking fossatum africae ( '' african ditch '' ) is a linear defensive structure ( limes ) that extended over 750 & nbsp ; km or more this figure depends very much on the way it is measured over the intervals where the fossatum was not constructed or has disappeared , and includes a significant section which may not be a fossatum in north africa constructed during the roman empire to defend and control the southern borders of the empire in the africa ( roman province ) charlemagne considered his empire ( later called the carolingian empire ) as the true successor to the roman empire and called himself '' emperor of the romans '' great wall , structures of similar scale and function , built by various dynasties in china sasanian defense lines , the borders of the neo-persian empire limitanei , soldiers on the late roman and early byzantine limites march ( territorial entity ) , medieval european borderlands the pale , the english-controlled strip of ireland frontiers of the roman empire : unesco official website official website of the verein deutsche limes-straße ( in german ) antikefan.de ( in german ) , german antiquarian site with maps vici.org interactive map with the limes and other roman castles and sites livius.org : limes antikefan : roman limes ( german ) derlimes.at official website of the limes group in austria ) ( in german , serbian , bosnian , croatian , montenegrin ) limes , italian review of geopolitics ( italian ) official website of the saalburg , the only fully reconstructed limes fort ( in german , english , french )
