flying embers are still a threat , and the fire ring may become hot enough to ignite material in contact with it , or the heat the water to a vapor thereby cracking the rocks as such , it is important for the fire builder to take multiple safety precautions , including : avoiding building campfires under hanging branches or over steep slopes , and clear a ten-foot diameter circle around the fire of all flammable debris when extinguishing a campfire , using plenty of water or dirt , then stirring the mixture and add more water , then check that there are no burning embers left whatsoever making sure the fire pit is large enough for the campfire and there are no combustibles near the campfire , and avoiding the construction of the campfire on a windy day a few decent natural tinders are cotton , birch bark , cedar bark , and fatwood , where available ; followed by dead , dry pine needles or grass ; a more comprehensive list is given in the article on tinder in fact , there are gradations of kindling , from sticks thinner than a finger to those as thick as a wrist a faggot is a related term indicating a bundle of small branches used to feed a small fire or continue developing a bigger fire out of a small one with the proliferation of packaged food , it is quite likely that plastics will be incinerated as well , a practice that not only produces toxic smoke but will also leave polluted ashes behind because of incomplete combustion at too-low open fire temperatures one downside to a tipi fire is that when it burns , the logs become unstable and can fall over the second pair is laid on top of the first , at right angles to it , and also on opposite sides of the tinder of all the fire-builds , the log cabin is the least vulnerable to premature collapse , but it is also inefficient because it makes the worst use of convection to ignite progressively larger pieces of fuel however , these qualities make the log cabin an ideal cooking fire as it burns for a long period of time and can support cookware this fire structure combines benefits of both fire types : the tipi allows the fire to ignite easily and the log cabin sustains the fire for a long time then , a long , thick piece of kindling is driven into the ground at an angle , so that it overhangs the tinder pile the traditional finland rakovalkea , or nying in scandinavian languages , also called by english terms long log fire or gap fire , is constructed by placing one long and thick piece of fuelwood ( log ) atop another , parallel , and bolstering them in place with four sturdy posts driven into the ground second , it can be easily scaled to larger sizes ( for a feast ) limited only by the length of available tree trunks the log is either cut ( usually only partially , but other variants do include totally splitting ) and then set upright ( ideally , the log needs to be cut evenly and on a level surface for stability ) the flat , circular top provides a surface to place a kettle , or pan for cooking , boiling liquids , etc the elevated position of the fire can serve as a better beacon than the typical ground-based campfire in some instances a keyhole fire is made in a keyhole-shaped fire ring , and is used in cooking a '' top lighter '' fire is built similar to a log cabin or pyre , but instead of the tinder and kindling being placed inside the cabin , it is placed in a tipi on top another variation to the top lighter , log cabin , or pyre is known by several names , most notably the pyramid , self-feeding , and upside-down method and secondly , this fire type requires minimal labor , thereby making it ideal as a fire of choice before bedding down for the evening without having to get up periodically to add fuelwood and/or stoke the fire to keep it going dakota smokeless pit fire is a tactical fire used by the united states military as the flame produces a low light signature , reduced smoke , and is easier to ignite under strong wind conditions two small holes are dug in the ground : one vertical for the firewood and the other slanted to the bottom of the first hole to provide a draft of air for nearly complete combustion optional are flat stones to partially cover the first hole and provide support for cookery , and a tree over the pits to disperse the smoke a star fire , or indian fire , is the fire design often depicted as the campfire of the old west once the fire is built , the tinder is lighted , using one of several methods smoking black powder produced by friction between a stick , or bow drill , or pump drill and a hole or crack on dry wood , a magnifying glass focusing sunlight , smoking material produced by a fire piston , smoking black powder produced by a bamboo fire saw smoking material produced by a fire roll ( small amount of cotton mixed with ash or iron rust , rolled vigorously between two flat stones or planks , until it starts smoking ) , smoking material produced by a piece of flint or ferro-rod struck against steel over amadou or other initial tinder , or an combustion , such as a match or a lighter metal fire rings generally do a good job of keeping out wind , but some of them are so high as to impede the circulation of oxygen in a small fire a small , enclosed fire that has slowed down may require vigorous blowing to get it going again , but excess blowing can extinguish a fire once large kindling is burning , all kindling is placed in the fire , then the fuel wood is placed on top of it ( unless , as in the rakovalkea fire-build , it is already there ) possibly the simplest method of cooking over a campfire and one of the most common is to roast food on long skewers that can be held above red glowing embers , or on the side near the flames ( not over flames in order to avoid sot and burnt food ) most campfires , though , are exclusively for recreation , often as a venue for conversation , storytelling , or song if a root , particularly a dead one , is exposed to fire , it may smoulder underground and ignite the parent tree long after the original fire is doused and the campers have left the area this latter threat is less likely , but a fire in a branch is extremely difficult to put out without firefighting equipment , and may spread more quickly than a ground fire water is continuously poured until the hissing stops , then the ashes are stirred to ensure that water reaches the entire fire , and more water is added if necessary file : campfire.webm 2017 - camp fire conducted at kv kanhangad in connection with scout guides camp file :
