section 4d.13 and section 8d.07 of the manual on uniform traffic control devices approaching trains activate a routine where , before the train signals and gates are activated , all traffic signal phases go to red , except for the signal immediately after the train crossing , which turns green ( or flashing yellow ) to allow traffic on the tracks to clear ( in some cases , there are auxiliary traffic signals prior to the railroad crossing which will turn red , keeping new traffic from crossing the tracks the history of level crossings depends on the location , but often early level crossings had a flagman in a nearby booth who would , on the approach of a train , wave a red flag or lantern to stop all traffic and clear the tracks railway safety in the european union , safety overview 2017 , sbn 978-92-9205-383-3 issn 2529-6302 doi:10.2821/813806 doi:10.2821/474487 tr-ag-17-101-en-c tr-ag-17-101-en-n 53 % of all those level crossings are active level where users are protected from or warned of the approaching train by devices activated when it is unsafe for the user to traverse the crossing where third rail systems have level crossings , there is a gap in the third rail over the level crossing , but this does not necessarily interrupt the power supply to trains since they may have current collectors on multiple cars aircraft landing on sealed 1310-metre runway 14l/32r are signalled with two red flashing lights on either side of the runway and a horizontal bar of flashing red lights to indicate the runway south of the railway line is closed , and may only land on the section of the runway north of the railway line in the 19th century and for much of the 20th , a written sign warning '' stop , look , and listen '' ( or similar wording ) was the sole protection at most level crossings at railway stations , a pedestrian level crossing is sometimes provided to allow passengers to reach other platforms in the absence of an underpass or bridge , or for disabled access as far as warning systems for road users are concerned , level crossings either have '' passive '' protection , in the form of various types of warning signs , or '' active '' protection , using automatic warning devices such as flashing lights , warning sounds , and barriers or gates gated crossings became commonplace in many areas , as they protected the railway from people trespassing and livestock , and they protected the users of the crossing when closed by the signalman/gateman in other areas , the traffic parallel to the railroad track will have a flashing yellow for the duration of the train while the other directions face a flashing red light for the duration of the train still in other areas , the traffic parallel to the railroad track will have a green light for the duration of the train while the other directions face a red light for the duration of the train when the full length of the runway is open , a vertical bar of green lights signal to the aircraft , with regular rail signals on either side of the runway indicating trains to stop
