the causes of and treatments for hyponatremia can only be understood by having a grasp of the size of the body fluid compartments and subcompartments and their regulation ; how under normal circumstances the body is able to maintain the sodium concentration within a narrow range ( homeostasis of body fluid osmolality ) ; conditions can cause that feedback system to malfunction ( pathophysiology ) ; and the consequences of the malfunction of that system on the size and solute concentration of the fluid compartments any cause of hypovolemia such as prolonged vomiting , decreased oral intake , severe diarrhea diuretic use ( due to the diuretic causing a volume depleted state and thence adh release , and not a direct result of diuretic-induced urine sodium loss ) addison 's disease and congenital adrenal hyperplasia in which the adrenal glands do not produce enough steroid hormones ( combined glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid deficiency ) pancreatitis prolonged exercise and sweating , combined with drinking water without electrolytes is the cause of exercise-associated hyponatremia ( eah ) hyponatremia occurs 1 ) when the hypothalamic-kidney feedback loop is overwhelmed by increased fluid intake , 2 ) the feedback loop malfunctions such that adh is always '' turned on '' , 3 ) the receptors in the kidney are always '' open '' regardless of there being no signal from adh to be open ; or 4 ) there is an increased adh even though there is no normal stimulus ( elevated serum sodium ) for adh to be increased each category represents a different underlying reason for the increase in adh that led to the water retention and thence hyponatremia : high volume hyponatremia , wherein there is decreased effective circulating volume ( less blood flowing in the body ) even though total body volume is increased ( by the presence of edema or swelling , especially in the ankles ) normal volume hyponatremia , wherein the increase in adh is secondary to either physiologic but excessive adh release ( as occurs with nausea or severe pain ) or inappropriate and non-physiologic secretion of adh , that is , syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone hypersecretion ( siadh ) '' impairment of urine diluting ability related to adh '' occurs in nine situations : 1 ) arterial volume depletion 2 ) hemodynamically-mediated , 3 ) congestive heart failure , 4 ) cirrhosis , 5 ) nephrosis , 6 ) spinal cord disease , 7 ) addison 's disease , 8 ) cerebral salt wasting , and 9 ) syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion ( siadh ) often categorized under euvolemic is hyponatremia due to inadequate urine solute ( not enough chemicals or electrolytes to produce urine ) as occurs in beer potomania or '' tea and toast '' hyponatremia , hyponatremia due to hypothyroidism or central adrenal insufficiency , and those rare instances of hyponatremia that are truly secondary to excess water intake these groups include persons who have hypovolemic hyponatremia and receive intravenous fluids ( thus correcting their hypovolemia ) , persons with adrenal insufficiency who receive hydrocortisone , persons in whom a medication causing increased adh release has been stopped , and persons who have hyponatremia due to decreased salt and/or solute intake in their diet who are treated with a higher solute diet normally , when mild hyponatremia begins to occur , that is , the serum sodium begins to fall below 135 meq/l , there is no secretion of adh , and the kidney stops returning water to the body from the kidney tubule however , mild hyponatremia ( plasma sodium levels at 131â€“135 & nbsp ; mmol/l ) may be associated with complications and subtle symptoms ( for example , increased falls , altered posture and gait , reduced attention , impaired cognition , and possibly higher rates of death ) signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include nausea and vomiting , headache , short-term memory loss , confusion , lethargy , fatigue , loss of appetite , irritability , muscle weakness , spasms or cramps , seizures , and decreased consciousness or coma miscellaneous causes that are not included under the above classification scheme include the following : false hyponatremia ( due to massive increases in blood triglyceride levels or extreme elevation of immunoglobulins as may occur in multiple myeloma ) hyponatremia with elevated tonicity can occur with high blood sugar if the feed-back system is normal , but an impairment of urine diluting ability unrelated to adh occurs , this is 1 ) oliguric kidney failure , 2 ) tubular interstitial kidney disease , 3 ) diuretics , or 4 ) nephrogenic syndrome of antidiuresis the specific causes of hyponatremia are generally divided into those with low tonicity ( lower than normal concentration of solutes ) , without low tonicity , and falsely low sodiums this system operates as follows : in some of the cells of the hypothalamus , there are osmoreceptors which respond to an elevated serum sodium in body fluids by signalling the posterior pituitary gland to secrete antidiuretic hormone ( adh ) ( vasopressin ) in persons with hyponatremia due to low blood volume ( hypovolemia ) from diuretics with simultaneous hypokalemia , correction of the low potassium level can assist with correction of hyponatremia there is tentative evidence that vasopressin receptor antagonists ( vaptans ) , such as conivaptan , may be slightly more effective than fluid restriction in those with high volume or normal volume hyponatremia if the feedback system is overwhelmed , this is water intoxication with maximally dilute urine and is caused by 1 ) pathological water drinking ( primary polydipsia ) , 2 ) beer potomania , 3 ) overzealous intravenous solute free water infusion , or 4 ) infantile water intoxication a rapid rise in serum sodium is anticipated in certain groups when the cause of the hyponatremia is addressed thus warranting closer monitoring in order to avoid overly rapid correction of the blood sodium concentration
