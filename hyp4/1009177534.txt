discrimination based on skin color , ( measured for example on the fitzpatrick scale ) is closely related to racial discrimination , as skin color is often used as a proxy for race in everyday interactions , and is one factor used by legal systems that apply detailed criteria a person 's national origin ( the country in which they were born or have citizenship ) is sometimes used in determining a person 's ethnicity or race , but discrimination based on national origin can also be independent of race ( and is sometimes specifically addressed in anti-discrimination laws ) in such cases , racial discrimination can occur because someone is of an ethnicity defined as outside that race , or ethnic discrimination ( or ethnic hatred , ethnic conflict , and ethnic violence ) can occur between groups who consider each other to be the same race racial discrimination in the workplace falls into two basic categories : disparate treatment : an employer 's policies discriminate based upon any immutable racial characteristic , such as skin , eye or hair color , and certain facial features ; disparate impact : although an employer may not intend to discriminate based on racial characteristics , its policies nonetheless have an adverse effect based upon race racial boundaries can involve many factors ( such as ancestry , physical appearance , national origin , language , religion , and culture ) , and maybe set in law by governments , or may depend on local cultural norms american and south african laws which divided the population into whites from europe and blacks from sub-saharan africa often caused problems of interpretation when dealing with people from other areas , such as the rest of the mediterranean basin , asia , north africa , or even native americans , with classification as non-white usually resulting in legal discrimination for example , evidence of a weaker relationship between racial discrimination and well-being in children of african descent may be linked to parent-guided socialization practices to help children cope with racial discrimination , or possibly lack of research concerning the severity of discrimination for example , the 2015 community survey of the united states census accepted identification as mexican americans of any race ( for example including native americans from mexico , descendants of africans transported to new spain as enslaved people , and descendants of spanish colonists ) reverse discrimination is a term for allegations that the member of a dominant or majority group has suffered discrimination for the benefit of a minority or historically disadvantaged group for example , the population registration act , 1950 was used to enforce the apartheid system in south africa , and brazil has set up boards to assign a racial category to people for the purpose of enforcing racial quotas discrimination based on being hispanic or latino does occur in the united states and might be considered a form of racial discrimination if '' hispanic '' or '' latino '' are considered a new racial category derived from ethnicities which formed after the independence of the former colonies of the americas it ranged from below 5 % in australia , new zealand , and many countries in the americas , to 51.4 % in jordan ; europe had wide variation , from below 5 % in the uk , norway , and sweden , to 22.7 % in france in countries where migration , unification , or breakup has occurred relatively recently , the process of ethnogenesis may complicate the determination of both ethnicity and race and is related to identity ( social science ) in surveys taken by the mexican government , the same people would have been described as indigenous , black , or white ( with a large number of people unclassified who might be described as mestizo ) hyperdescent ) classify the same people differently , and for various reasons some people '' pass '' as a member of a different race than they would otherwise be classified in , possibly avoiding legal or interpersonal discrimination for example , one of the studies included in the report by ngo ( 2017 ) , studied an extracurricular program that analyzed the racial discrimination faced by hmong adolescents and the exploration of critical consciousness participation in theater discrimination based on caste is similar ; because caste is hereditary , people of the same caste are usually considered to be of the same race and ethnicity although the medicaid program was passed to ensure african americans and other minorities received the healthcare treatment they deserved and to limit discrimination in hospital facilities , there still seems to be an underlying cause for the low number of black patients admitted to hospitals , like not receiving the proper dosage of medication with regard to employment , multiple audit study have found strong evidence of racial discrimination in the united states ' labor market , with magnitudes of employers ' preferences of white applicants found in these studies ranging from 50 % to 240 % '' discrimination in a low wage labor market : a field experiment , '' 2009 , american sociological review , by devah pager , bruce western , and bart bonikowski '' the mark of a criminal record , '' 2003 , american journal of sociology , by devah pager another recent audit by ucla sociologist s ) though as an ethno-religious group they often face religious discrimination , the whiteness of all jews was also challenged in the united states , with attempts to classify them as asiatic ( palestine being in western asia ) or semitic ( which would also include arabs ) ( 2018 ) analyzes a combination of previous studies indicating an existing relationship between racial discrimination and well-being , more specifically , in regards to mental health , behaviors , and academic performance of adolescents ranging from early adolescence ( 10-13 ) to late adolescence ( 17 and older ) a given race is sometimes defined as a set of ethnicities from populations in neighboring geographic areas ( such as a continent like australia or a subcontinental region like south asia ) that are typically similar in appearance for example , someone of a south asian ethnicity who grew up in london , speaks british english with a london accent , and whose family has assimilated to british culture might be treated more favorably than someone of the same ethnicity who is a recent immigrant and speaks indian english illnesses like cancer and heart diseases are more prevalent in minorities , which is one of the factors for the high mortality rate in the group
