in traditional life insurance , actuarial science focuses on the analysis of mortality , the production of life tables , and the application of interest to produce life insurance , annuities and endowment policies in health insurance , including insurance provided directly by employers , and social insurance , actuarial science focuses on the analysis of rates of disability , morbidity , mortality , fertility and other contingencies the effects of consumer choice and the geographical distribution of the utilization of medical services and procedures , and the utilization of drugs and therapies , is also of great importance in the pension industry , actuarial methods are used to measure the costs of alternative strategies with regard to the design , funding , accounting , administration , and maintenance or redesign of pension plans the strategies are greatly influenced by short-term and long-term bond rates , the funded status of the pension and benefit arrangements , collective bargaining ; the employer 's old , new and foreign competitors ; the changing demographics of the workforce ; changes in the internal revenue code ; changes in the attitude of the internal revenue service regarding the calculation of surpluses ; and equally importantly , both the short and long term financial and economic trends finally , funding schemes have to be developed that are manageable and satisfy the standards board or regulators of the appropriate country , such as the financial accounting standards board in the united states in social welfare programs , the office of the chief actuary ( ocact ) , social security administration plans and directs a program of actuarial estimates and analyses relating to ssa-administered retirement , survivors and disability insurance programs and to proposed changes in those programs it evaluates operations of the social security ( united states ) and the federal disability insurance trust fund , conducts studies of program financing , performs actuarial and demographic research on social insurance and related program issues involving mortality , morbidity , utilization , retirement , disability , survivorship , marriage , unemployment , poverty , old age , families with children , etc actuarial science provides data collection , measurement , estimating , forecasting , and valuation tools to provide financial and underwriting data for management to assess marketing opportunities and the nature of the risks in the reinsurance fields , actuarial science can be used to design and price reinsurance and retrocession arrangements , and to establish reserve funds for known claims and future claims and catastrophes another important advance came in 1662 from a london draper named john graunt , who showed that there were predictable patterns of longevity and death in a group , or cohort , of people of the same age , despite the uncertainty of the date of death of any one individual one could now set up an insurance scheme to provide life insurance or pensions for a group of people , and to calculate with some degree of accuracy how much each person in the group should contribute to a common fund assumed to earn a fixed rate of interest the calculations of life insurance premiums and reserving requirements are rather complex , and actuaries developed techniques to make the calculations as easy as possible , for example '' commutation functions '' ( essentially precalculated columns of summations over time of discounted values of survival and death probabilities ) from pencil-and-paper to punchcards to current high-speed devices , the modeling and forecasting ability of the actuary has rapidly improved , while still being heavily dependent on the assumptions input into the models , and actuaries needed to adjust to this new world traditional actuarial science and modern financial economics in the us have different practices , which is caused by different ways of calculating funding and investment strategies , and by different regulations regulations are from the armstrong investigation of 1905 , the glassâ€“steagall act of 1932 , the adoption of the mandatory security valuation reserve by the national association of insurance commissioners , which cushioned market fluctuations , and the financial accounting standards board , ( fasb ) in the us and canada , which regulates pensions valuations and funding today , the profession , both in practice and in the educational syllabi of many actuarial organizations , is cognizant of the need to reflect the combined approach of tables , loss models , stochastic methods , and financial theory actuarial models and associated tables , such as the mnsost-r , static-99 , and sorag , have been used since the late 1990s to determine the likelihood that a sex offender will re-offend and thus whether he or she should be institutionalized or set free
