. modern sources broadly agree that if made from a single piece of fabric , the toga of a high status roman in the late republic would have required a piece approximately 12 & nbsp ; ft in length ; in the imperial era , around 18 & nbsp ; ft , a third more than its predecessor , and in the late imperial era around 8 feet wide and up to 18 or 20 feet in length for the most complex , pleated forms } } the emperor marcus aurelius , rather than wear the '' dress to which his rank entitled him '' at his own salutationes , chose to wear a plain white citizen 's toga instead ; an act of modesty for any patron , unlike caligula , who wore a triumphal toga picta or any other garment he chose , according to whim ; or nero , who caused considerable offence when he received visiting senators while dressed in a tunic embroidered with flowers , topped off with a muslin neckerchief a client had to be at his patron 's beck and call , to perform whatever '' togate works '' were required ; and the patron might even expect to be addressed as '' domine '' ( lord , or master ) ; a citizen-client of the equites , superior to all lesser mortals by virtue of rank and costume , might thus approach the shameful condition of dependent servitude even as a satirical analogy , the equation of togate client and slave would have shocked those who cherished the toga as a symbol of personal dignity and auctoritas – a meaning underlined during the saturnalia festival , when the toga was '' very consciously put aside '' , in a ritualised , strictly limited inversion of the master-slave relationship infuriated by the sight of a darkly clad throng of men at a public meeting , he sarcastically quoted virgil at them , '' romanos , rerum dominos , gentemque togatam '' ( '' romans , lords of the world and the toga-wearing people '' ) , then ordered that in future , the aediles ban anyone not wearing the toga from the forum and its environs – rome 's '' civic heart '' '' if , on the other hand , the '' toga falls down at the beginning of our speech , or when we have only proceeded but a little way , the failure to replace it is a sign of indifference , or sloth , or sheer ignorance of the way in which clothes should be worn '' 53 , citing horace , epodes , 4.8 in the early second century ad , the satirist juvenal claimed that '' in a great part of italy , no-one wears the toga , except in death '' ; in martial 's rural idyll there is '' never a lawsuit , the toga is scarce , the mind at ease '' . towards the end of the republic , the arch-conservative cato the younger favoured the shorter , ancient republican type of toga ; it was dark and '' scanty '' ( exigua ) , and cato wore it without tunic or shoes ; all this would have been recognised as an expression of his moral probity during the early roman imperial era , members of the praetorian guard ( the emperor 's personal guard as '' first citizen '' , and a military force under his personal command ) , concealed their weapons under white , civilian-style togas when on duty in the city , offering the reassuring illusion that they represented a traditional republican , civilian authority , rather than the military arm of an imperial autocracy roman historians believed that rome 's legendary founder and first king , the erstwhile shepherd romulus , had worn a toga as his clothing of choice ; the purple-bordered toga praetexta was supposedly used by etruscan magistrates , and introduced to rome by her third king , tullus hostilius the extension of citizenship , from around 6 million citizens under augustus to between 40 and 60 million under the '' universal citizenship '' of caracalla 's constitutio antoniniana ( 212 ad ) , probably further reduced whatever distinctive value the toga still held for commoners , and accelerated its abandonment among their class he reserved the most honourable seats , front of house , for senators and equites ; this was how it had always been , before the chaos of the civil wars ; or rather , how it was supposed to have been . in roman territories , the toga was explicitly forbidden to non-citizens ; to foreigners , freedmen , and slaves ; to roman exiles ; exiles were deprived of citizenship and the protection of roman law . high-status ( consular or senatorial ) images from the late 4th century show a further ornate variation , known as the '' broad eastern toga '' ; it hung to the mid-calf , was heavily embroidered , and was worn over two pallium-style undergarments , one of which had full length sleeves like the empire itself , the peace that the toga came to represent had been earned through the extraordinary and unremitting collective efforts of its citizens , who could therefore claim '' the time and dignity to dress in such a way '' in livy 's history of rome , the patrician hero lucius quinctius cincinnatus , retired from public life and clad ( presumably ) in tunic or loincloth , is ploughing his field when emissaries of the senate arrive , and ask him to put on his toga to minimise waste , the smaller , old-style forms of toga may have been woven as a single , seamless , selvedged piece ; the later , larger versions may have been made from several pieces sewn together ; size seems to have counted for a lot the toga was an approximately semi-circular woolen cloth , usually white , worn draped over the left shoulder and around the body : the word '' toga '' probably derives from tegere , to cover ( '' toga of manhood '' ) also known as toga alba or toga pura : a plain white toga , worn on formal occasions by adult male commoners , and by senators not having a imperium the so-called '' banded '' or '' stacked '' toga ( latinised as toga contabulata ) appeared in the late second century ad and was distinguished by its broad , smooth , slab-like panels of pleated material , more or less correspondent with umbo , sinus and balteus , or applied over the same one rises from low between the legs , and is laid over the left shoulder ; another more or less follows the upper edge of the sinus ; yet another follows the lower edge of a more-or-less vestigial balteus then descends to the upper shin . to a great extent , the toga itself determined the orator 's style of delivery : '' we should not cover the shoulder and the whole of the throat , otherwise our dress will be unduly narrowed and will lose the impressive effect produced by breadth at the chest . the umbo ( literally '' knob '' ) was a pouch of the toga 's fabric pulled out over the balteus ( the diagonal section of the toga across the chest ) in imperial-era forms of the toga appian 's history of rome finds its strife-torn late republic tottering at the edge of chaos ; most seem to dress as they like , not as they ought : '' for now the roman people are much mixed with foreigners , there is equal citizenship for freedmen , and slaves dress like their masters the toga 's apparent natural simplicity and '' elegant , flowing lines '' were the result of diligent practice and cultivation ; to avoid an embarrassing disarrangement of its folds , its wearer had to walk with measured , stately gait , every male roman citizen was entitled to wear some kind of toga – martial refers to a lesser citizen 's '' small toga '' and a poor man 's '' little toga '' ( both togula ) , some later roman and post-roman sources describe it as solid purple or red , either identifying or confusing it with the dress worn by the ancient roman kings ( also used to clothe images of the gods ) or reflecting changes in the trabea itself women 's adoption of the stola may have paralleled the increasing identification of the toga with citizen men , but this seems to have been a far from straightforward process when worn by a woman in this later era , the toga would have been a '' blatant display '' of her '' exclusion from the respectable roman hierarchy '' until the marian reforms of 107 bc , the lower ranks of rome 's military forces were '' farmer-soldiers '' , a militia of citizen smallholders conscripted for the duration of hostilities , the romans believed that in rome 's earliest days , its military had gone to war in togas , hitching them up and back for action by using what became known as the '' gabine cinch '' . non-citizens and foreign-born auxiliaries given honesta missio were usually granted citizenship , land or stipend , the right to wear the toga , and an obligation to the patron who had granted these honours ; usually their senior officer the toga was draped , rather than fastened , around the body , and was held in position by the weight and friction of its fabric only a higher-class roman , a magistrate , would have had lictors to clear his way , and even then , wearing a toga was a challenge . despite the overwhelming quantity of roman togate portraits at every social level , and in every imaginable circumstance , at most times rome 's thoroughfares would have been with crowded with citizens and non-citizens in a variety of colourful garments , with few togas in evidence in this context , modern sources understand the toga – or perhaps merely the description of particular women as togata – as an instrument of inversion and realignment ; a respectable ( thus stola-clad ) woman should be demure , sexually passive , modest and obedient , morally impeccable a law issued by co-emperors gratian , valentinian ii and theodosius i in 382 ad ( codex theodosianus 14.10.1 ) states that while senators in the city of rome may wear the paenula in daily life , they must wear the toga when attending their official duties the unmarried daughters of respectable , reasonably well-off citizens sometimes wore the toga praetexta until puberty or marriage , when they adopted the stola , which they wore over a full-length , usually long-sleeved tunic the traditional toga was made of wool , which was thought to possess apotropaic magic and the evil eye ; the toga praetexta ( used by magistrates , priests and freeborn youths ) was always woolen respectable women , the sons of freeborn men , and provincials during the early empire could hold lesser forms of citizenship ; they were protected by law but could not vote , or stand for public office traditionalists idealised rome 's urban and rustic citizenry as descendants of a hardy , virtuous , toga-clad peasantry , but the toga 's bulk and complex drapery made it entirely impractical for manual work or physically active leisure : contra goldman 's description of roman clothing , including the toga , as '' simple and elegant , practical and comfortable '' in . from at least the mid-republic on , the military reserved their togas for formal leisure and religious festivals ; the tunic and sagum ( heavy rectangular cloak held on the shoulder with a brooch ) were used or preferred for active duty tyrian purple was supposedly reserved for the toga picta , the border of the toga praetexta , and elements of the priestly dress worn by the inviolate vestal virgins the purple-red border of the toga praetexta was woven onto the toga using a process known as '' tablet weaving '' ; such applied borders are a feature of etruscan dress the manly toga itself could signify corruption , if worn too loosely , or worn over a long-sleeved , '' effeminate '' tunic , or woven too fine and thin , near transparent toga candida : '' bright toga '' ;
