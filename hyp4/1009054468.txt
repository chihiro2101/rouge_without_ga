mountains surround utah valley on three sides : the wasatch range to the east , traverse mountains to the north , and the lake mountains to the west at its peak 30,000 years ago , lake bonneville reached an elevation of above sea level and had a surface area of , which was nearly as large as lake michigan as evaporation rates exceeded inflow rates , the lake began to dry up , leaving utah lake , the great salt lake , sevier lake , and rush lake as remnants image : american fork canyon and view of bonneville terrace.jpg thumb left wasatch range and ancient shoreline of lake bonneville over the roughly 65,000 years that lake bonneville existed , sediments built up , creating a lacustrine plain over utah valley this shallowness allows winds to easily stir up sediments from the lake 's bottom , contributing to the turbidity or the impression of pollution seen in utah lake 's water ( 32 % ) are managed by the united states forest service , ( 11 % ) are managed by other government entities , and the majority of the rest , ( 51 % ) , are privately owned the river flows north through utah , salt lake , and davis counties and then into the southeast portion of the great salt lake given the lake 's semi-arid climate , large surface area , and shallow average depth , evaporation accounts for 42 % of utah lake 's outflow image : jordan river pumps.jpg thumb left jordan river pumping station at utah lake , april 2010 after several years of drought , irrigation companies were arguing over their share of utah lake 's water from the jordan river the decree stated that the irrigation companies '' are entitled to a decree awarding to them , subject to the limitations hereinafter set forth , the right to the use of all the balance of the waters of the jordan river , for municipal , irrigation , culinary , and domestic purposes , to the extent of the capacity of their several canals , and the right to impound and store all of the waters of said river in utah lake '' in response to the drought , a pumping plant was installed at the outlet of the jordan river from utah lake when the water level in utah lake exceeds this level , the jordan river pumps and gates are left open in the state of utah , the utah division of water quality and utah division of drinking water are responsible for the management and regulation of water quality lakes , rivers , and streams that exceed the standard levels are then placed on the deq 303d list in accordance with the clean water act the act requires states to identify impaired water bodies every two years and develop a total maximum daily load ( tmdl ) for pollutants that a body of water can assimilate without causing the water body to exceed the water quality standards high levels of phosphorus can cause high levels of nuisance algae growth , low dissolved oxygen , and eletds tells about the concentration of mineral salts in the water , which can cause problems to agriculture and culinary water supplies excess levels of phosphorus come from multiple sources , but namely the waste water treatment plants , are extremely concerning when it comes to utah lake management because high levels can trigger harmful algal blooms and eutrophication descy , j.p 129-138 , 2016 there is some discussion as to how much of the phosphorus is the result of anthropogenic causes and how much is the result of historic phosphorus stored in the lake sediment krissy wilson of utah 's division of wildlife resources , stated in 2010 that water quality is now improving , with greater flows of water , among other things , contributing to the improvement there are several cyanobacteria species that are especially common when phosphorus levels and temperature , among other unknown criteria , are favorable for harmful algal blooms franciscan missionary silvestre v√©lez de escalante , while on his expedition in late summer and early autumn of 1776 , was trying to find a land route from santa fe , new mexico to monterey , california from escalante 's journal , he describes utah lake : '' the lake , which must be six leagues wide and fifteen leagues long , extends as far as one of these valleys escalante 's record clearly distinguishes between this lake timpanogos , a body of fresh water that he saw and sized , and great salt lake , which he did not see or name , but was described to him as a river '' communicates with others much larger in april 1849 , a group of about thirty families came into utah valley and settled on the provo river , very close to the main timpanogot village on the provo river historically , there have been four species of amphibia , twelve species of reptiles , thirteen species of fish , 152 species of birds , and forty-two species of mammals found in the environs of utah lake the dumping of raw sewage , destruction of natural habit , hunting , and the introduction of non-native fish species have taken a toll on the native species in and around the lake leaders of the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints elders sent members in the salt lake valley to utah lake to obtain fish ; an estimated of fish were brought back of the thirteen species of fish native to utah lake , one species is extinct ( the utah lake sculpin ) , one is no longer present in the lake and is under review to see if it qualifies for protection under the endangered species act ( least chub ) , one is already listed as endangered ( the june sucker ) , and one is found in relative abundance throughout utah ( the utah sucker ) the utah lake sculpin was last found in 1928 , and likely became extinct in the 1930s after severe drought lowered the lake levels , allowing much of the lake to freeze , overcrowding fish in unfrozen portions of the lake utah lake sculpin , utah conservation data center the bonneville redside shiner , mottled sculpin , lepidomeda copei , utah chub , speckled dace , longnose dace , mountain whitefish and mountain sucker are no longer in the lake , but still exist in tributaries image : lakepowellcarp5437.jpg thumb right common carp , such as these in lake powell , are the dominant species of fish in the lake without vegetation , winds can more easily stir up sediment from the bottom of the lake , which is already a problem due to the lake 's shallowness , resulting in greater turbidity and less sunlight reaching the remaining vegetation to remove 5 million pounds of carp each year , as part of the june sucker recovery implementation program 's efforts to restore utah lake to a habitat in which the june sucker can survive the intent is to cause a crash in the carp population which will allow the ecosystem to begin to rebuild and the june sucker to reestablish dominance in the lake the utah lake commission has previously stated its goal is to remove 32 million pounds of carp from the lake , and more than 17 million pounds have been removed as of november 2019 the ownership of lands along the shoreline of utah lake has been in dispute between the state of utah and farmers for many years the bed of utah lake , along with other natural lakes , was granted to the state upon admission to the union in 1896 however , due to the lack of an exact definition and significantly fluctuating lake levels , intermittently dry areas and wetlands , including all of provo bay , have been claimed and farmed by surrounding land owners in january 2018 , the utah department of natural resources received a project proposal as a potential solution to the lake 's nutrient pollution , invasive species , and murky water the salt lake tribune available at : the project proposal involved dredging the lake bottom of all nutrient-loaded sediment , replacing invasive plant and animal species with native species , and restoring the water quality before building and developing housing on arch-shaped islands available at : the proposal led to the creation of the house bill 272 - utah lake amendments ( hb 272 ) , which asserted that utah lake faced serious challenges , that conservation and restoration was possible and in the interest of the state , and authorized '' the division of forestry , fire , and state lands to dispose of state land in exchange for the execution of a project for the comprehensive restoration of utah lake , '' an act which would otherwise be prohibited specific issues include the fact that the project would likely lead to the creation of anoxic waters due to lake stratification , the destruction of the lake 's unique hydrology and biogeochemistry , the release of toxins and nutrients , altering the lake from its natural state , and geology unsuitable for supporting inhabited islands the salt lake tribune available at : the ability of the developer to maintain the alterations to the lake after the projects completion has also been brought into question june sucker recovery implementation program utah lake commission utah lake state park utah lake wetland
