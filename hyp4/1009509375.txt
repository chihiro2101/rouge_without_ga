originally , vehicle registration was the responsibility of borough and county councils throughout great britain , a system created by the motor car act 1903 the licensing system was centralised in 1965 and administered from the driver and vehicle licensing centre ( dvlc ) in swansea in april 1990 , the dvlc was renamed as the driver and vehicle licensing agency ( dvla ) , becoming an executive agency of department for transport for example , by the dvla itself to identify untaxed vehicles , and by outside agencies to identify keepers of cars entering central london who have not paid the congestion charge , or who exceed speed limits on a road that has speed cameras by matching the cars to their keepers utilising the dvla database the current dvla vehicle register was built by eds under a £5 million contract signed in 1996 , with a planned implementation date on october 1998 , though actual implementation was delayed by a year it uses a client–server architecture and uses the vehicle identification number , rather than the registration plate , as the primary key to track vehicles , eliminating the possibility of having multiple registrations for a single vehicle the database of drivers , developed in the late 1980s , holds details of some 42 million driving licence holders in the uk it is used to produce driving licences and to assist bodies such as the driver and vehicle standards agency , police and courts in the enforcement of legislation concerning driving entitlements and road safety the dvla revealed in december 2012 that it had temporarily banned 294 public bodies , including local councils and police forces , for not using their access to the database correctly between 2006 and 2012 it is suspected that this is part of a group of letter bombs sent to other organisations that deal with the administration of motoring charges and offences , such as capita in central london , which was targeted a few days earlier the dvla sells details to companies for £2.50 , but it was found that the agency had sold some of these to a business which had been fined weeks before for unfair business practices
