in the early 1940s , he worked in a foundry in bayonne , new jersey , where he was an organizer and shop steward for the united electrical workers as well as a recruiter for the swp from 1947 , bookchin collaborated with a fellow lapsed trotskyist , the german expatriate josef weber , in new york in the movement for a democracy of content , a group of 20 or so post-trotskyists who collectively edited the periodical the movement for a democracy of content '' once again the dead are walking in our midst , '' he wrote , '' ironically , draped in the name of marx , the man who tried to bury the dead of the nineteenth century so the revolution of our own day can do nothing better than parody , in turn , the october revolution of 1917 and the civil war of 1918–1920 , with its 'class line , ' its bolshevik party , its 'proletarian dictatorship , ' its puritanical morality , and even its slogan , 'soviet power ' '' in 1971 , he moved to burlington , vermont , with a group of friends , to put into practice his ideas of decentralization in the fall of 1973 , he was hired by goddard college to lecture on technology ; his lectures led to a teaching position and to the creation of the social ecology studies program in 1974 and the institute for social ecology ( ise ) soon thereafter , of which he became the director in from urbanization to cities ( published in 1987 as the rise of urbanization and the decline of citizenship ) , bookchin traced the democratic traditions that influenced his political philosophy and defined the implementation of the libertarian municipalism concept in 1995 , bookchin lamented the decline of american anarchism into primitivism , anti-technologism , neo-situationism , individual self-expression , and '' ad hoc adventurism , '' at the expense of forming a social movement ' '' verslius , arthur ( june 20 , 2005 ) death of the left ? , the american conservative the publication of social anarchism or lifestyle anarchism in 1995 , criticizing this tendency , was startling to anarchists he placed his ideas into a new political ideology : communalism ( spelled with a capital '' c '' to differentiate it from other forms of communalism ) , a form of libertarian socialism that retains his ideas about assembly democracy and the necessity of decentralization of settlement , power/money/influence , agriculture , manufacturing , etc bookchin was critical of class-centered analysis of marxism and simplistic anti-state forms of libertarianism and liberalism and wished to present what he saw as a more complex view of societies in the ecology of freedom : the emergence and dissolution of hierarchy , he says that : my use of the word hierarchy in the subtitle of this work is meant to be provocative this practice , in the name of a '' classless '' or '' libertarian '' society , could easily conceal the existence of hierarchical relationships and a hierarchical sensibility , both of which-even in the absence of economic exploitation or political coercion-would serve to perpetuate unfreedom 3 bookchin also points to an accumulation of hierarchical systems throughout history that has occurred up to contemporary societies which tends to determine the human collective and individual psyche : the objective history of the social structure becomes internalized as a subjective history of the psychic structure rather , bookchin felt that our environmental predicament is the result of the cancerous logic of capitalism , a system aimed at maximizing profit instead of enriching human lives : '' by the very logic of its grow-or-die imperative , capitalism may well be producing ecological crises that gravely imperil the integrity of life on this planet '' he claims we need a constant awareness that a given society 's irrationality is deep seated , that its serious pathologies are not isolated problems that can be cured piecemeal but must be solved by sweeping changes in the often hidden sources of crisis and suffering—that awareness alone is what can hold a movement together , give it continuity , preserve its message and organization beyond a given generation , and expand its ability to deal with new issues and developments the answer then lies in communalism , a system encompassing a direct democracy political organization anchored in loosely confederated popular assemblies , decentralization of power , absence of domination of any kind , and replacing capitalism with human-centered forms of production in the history of environmentalism , social ecology is not a movement but a theory primarily associated with bookchin and elaborated over his body of work he presents a utopian philosophy of human evolution that combines the nature of biology and society into a third '' thinking nature '' beyond biochemistry and physiology , which he argues is a more complete , conscious , ethical , and rational nature bookchin then began to pursue the connection between ecological and social issues , culminating with his best-known book , the ecology of freedom , which he had developed over a decade in '' the next revolution '' , bookchin stresses the link that libertarian municipalism has with his earlier philosophy of social ecology in 1980 bookchin used the term '' libertarian municipalism '' , to describe a system in which libertarian institutions of directly democracy assemblies would oppose and replace the state with a confederation of free municipalities among these are the kurdish people 's protection units ( ypg ) and closely aligned kurdistan workers ' party ( pkk ) in turkey , which have kurdish–turkish conflict since the 1980s to try to secure greater political and cultural rights for the country 's kurds when bookchin died in 2006 , the pkk hailed the american thinker as '' one of the greatest social scientists of the 20th century '' , and vowed to put his theory into practice '' democratic confederalism '' , the variation on communalism developed by öcalan in his writings and adopted by the pkk , does not outwardly seek kurdish rights within the context of the formation of an independent state separate from turkey the pkk has had some success in implementing its programme , through organizations such as the democratic society congress ( dtk ) , which coordinates political and social activities within turkey , and the koma civakên kurdistan ( kck ) , which does so across all countries where kurds live post-scarcity anarchism ( 1971 ) the spanish anarchists : the heroic years ( 1977 ) the ecology of freedom : the emergence and dissolution of hierarchy ( 1982 ) price , andy , recovering bookchin : social ecology and the crises of our time , new compass ( 2012 ) biehl , janet , ecology or catastrophe : the life of murray bookchin ( oxford university press , 2015 )
