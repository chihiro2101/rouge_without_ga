a major criticism of this theory is that the formation and following of new norms indicates a level of self-awareness that is often missing in the individuals in crowds ( as evidenced by the study of deindividuation ) additionally , le bon and others have indicated that crowd members feel a lessened sense of legal culpability , due to the difficulty in prosecuting individual members of a mob it is in this context that you have a debate between scipio sighele , an italian lawyer and gabriel tarde , a french magistrate on how to determine criminal responsibility in the crowd and hence who to arrest crowd members are further convinced by the universality phenomenon , described by allport as the persuasive tendency of the idea that if everyone in the mob is acting in such-and-such a way , then it can not be wrong convergence theory holds that crowd behavior is not a product of the crowd , but rather the crowd is a product of the coming together of like-minded individuals , 1979 l'age des foules : un traité historique de psychologie des masses , fayard , 1981 ( about gustave le bon 's invention of crowd psychology and gabriel tarde ) howard rheingold , smart mob , 2003 james surowiecki , the wisdom of crowds , 2004 pugliese found the cause of crime in the failure of the criminal to adapt himself to his social surroundings , and benedikt , with whom tarde agreed , held that physical defects were not marks of the criminal qua criminal ( sighele , 1892 ; tarde , 1890 , 1892 , 1901 ) literature on crowds and crowd behavior appeared as early as 1841 , with the publication of charles mackay 's book extraordinary popular delusions and the madness of crowds professor alexandre lacassagne thought that the atavistic and degenerative theories as held by the italian school were exaggerations and false interpretations of the facts , and that the important factor was the social environment critics of this theory report that it still excludes the social determination of self and action , in that it argues that all actions of the crowd are born from the individuals ' intents deindividuation theory is largely based on the ideas of gustave le bon and argues that in typical crowd situations , factors such as anonymity , group unity , and arousal can weaken personal controls ( e.g the followers form the majority of the mob , as people tend to be creatures of conformity who are heavily influenced by the opinions of others this influence is evidenced by findings that when the stated purpose and values of a group changes , the values and motives of its members also change this standard is formed from stated values , but also from the actions of others in the crowd , and sometimes from a few in leadership-type positions in short , the individual submerged in the crowd loses self control as the '' collective mind '' takes over and makes the crowd member capable of violating personal or social norms emergent norm theory states that crowds have little unity at their outset , but during a period of milling about , key members suggest appropriate actions , and following members fall in line , forming the basis for the crowd 's norms a concern with this theory is that while it explains how crowds reflect social ideas and prevailing attitudes , it does not explain the mechanisms by which crowds enact to drive social change furthermore , adorno stated the bond linking the masses to the leader through the spectacle is feigned : '' when the leaders become conscious of mass psychology and take it into their own hands , it ceases to exist in a certain sense sigmund freud 's crowd behavior theory primarily consists of the idea that becoming a member of a crowd serves to unlock the unconscious mind there is limited research into the types of crowd and crowd membership and there is no consensus as to the classification of types of crowds this occurs because the super-ego , or moral center of consciousness , is displaced by the larger crowd , to be replaced by a charismatic crowd leader contagion refers to the propensity for individuals in a crowd to unquestioningly follow the predominant ideas and emotions of the crowd this organizational structure is that of the '' primal horde '' —pre-civilized society—and freud states that one must rebel against the leader ( re-instate the individual morality ) in order to escape from it that is , a crowd changes its level of emotional intensity over time , and therefore , can be classed in any one of the four types more recent theories have stated that deindividuation hinges upon a person being unable , due to situation , to have strong awareness of their self as an object of attention clark mcphail points out studies which show that '' the madding crowd '' does not take on a life of its own , apart from the thoughts and intentions of members in crowds which are more ambiguous , individuals will assume a new social identity as a member of the crowd it is when one no longer attends to the public reaction and judgement of individual behavior that antisocial behavior is elicited convergence theory claims that crowd behavior is not irrational ; rather , people in crowds express existing beliefs and values so that the mob reaction is the rational product of widespread popular feeling suggestion refers to the period in which the ideas and emotions of the crowd are primarily drawn from a shared unconscious ideology additionally , le bon 's theory ignores the socio-cultural context of the crowd , which some theorists argue can disempower social change
