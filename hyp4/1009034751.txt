although he had been cleared of the accusation of any fascist or nazi sympathies since the 1950s , and he never showed any sympathy to the political style of '' blood and soil '' popular in the third reich , jünger 's national conservatism and his ongoing role as conservative philosopher and icon made him a controversial figure in the eyes of the german marxist left , and huyssen ( 1993 ) argued that nevertheless '' his conservative literature made nazism highly attractive '' , and that '' the ontology of war depicted in storm of steel could be interpreted as a model for a new ,

photographs dealing with the first world war , hier spricht der feind : kriegserlebnisse unserer gegner ( the voice of the enemy : war experiences of our adversaries , 1931 ) one of the most important contributions of jünger 's later literary production is the metahistoric figure of the anarch , an ideal figure of a self-ownership , conceived in his novel eumeswil ( 1977 ) , which evolved from his earlier conception of the waldgänger , or '' forest fleer '' by influence of max stirner 's conception of the unique ( der einzige ) pour le mérite , the highest military decoration of the german empire , was awarded some 700 times during the war , but almost exclusively to high-ranking officers ( and seventy times to combat pilots ) ; jünger was one of only eleven infantry company leaders

of guillemont and was obliterated in a british offensive after the war , jünger was initially under some suspicion for his nationalist past , and he was banned from publishing in germany for four years by the british occupying forces because he refused to submit to the denazification procedures in the essay on pain , written and published in 1934 , jünger rejects the liberal values of liberty , security , ease , and comfort , and seeks instead the measure of man in the capacity to withstand pain and sacrifice in 1984 , he spoke at the verdun memorial , alongside his admirers , french

year before the end of his long life ( 1895–1998 ) , the german author ernst jünger converted to catholicism , a late change on a tumultuous path of searching and adventures that were far from exclusively spiritual he was clearly an inspiration to anti-nazi conservatives in the german army , and while in paris he was close to the old , mostly prussian , officers who carried out the assassination attempt against hitler on the marble cliffs ( 1939 , german title : auf den marmorklippen ) , a short novel in the form of a parable , uses metaphor to describe jünger 's negative perceptions of the situation in hitler 's germany in the 22 october 1932 edition of völkischer beobachter , the article '' das endlose dialektische gespräch '' ( '' the never-ending dialectical debate '' ) attacked jünger for his rejection of the '' blood and soil '' doctrine , accusing him of being an '' intellectualist '' and a liberal on 1 august 1914 , shortly after the start of world war i ,

the head on 14 june 1934 , jünger wrote a '' letter of rejection '' to the völkischer beobachter , the official nazi newspaper , in which he requested that none of his writings be published in it his vision in the glass bees ( 1957 , german title : gläserne bienen ) , of a future in which an automated machine-driven world threatens individualism , could be seen as a story within the science fiction genre jünger again refused a seat offered to him in the reichstag following the nazi party 's machtergreifung in january 1933 , and he refused the invitation to head the german academy of literature ( die deutsche akademie der dichtung ) a sensitive poet with training in botany and zoology , as well as a soldier , his works in general are infused with tremendous details of the natural world during the battle of the somme near the obliterated remains of the village of guillemont his platoon took up a front line position in a defile that had been shelled until it consisted of little more than a dip strewn with the rotting corpses of predecessors transferred to penal unit 999 as frontbewahrung after his parents had spoken to the presiding judge admiral scheurlen , he was killed near carrara in occupied italy on 29 november 1944 ( though jünger was never sure whether he had been shot by the enemy or by the ss ) becoming aware the position he was lying was falling , jünger rose , and as his lung drained of the blood spurting through the wound , recovered enough to escape in the confused situation in the battle of cambrai ( 1917 ) jünger sustained two wounds , by a bullet passing through his helmet at the back of the head , and another by a shell fragment on the forehead four of his world war ii diaries have been translated and published in english as : a german
