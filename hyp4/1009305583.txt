the first description of a simple lamp using crude mineral oil was provided by persian alchemist al-razi ( rhazes ) in 9th century baghdad , who referred to it as the '' naffatah '' in his kitab al-asrar ( book of secrets ) the glass chimney needs a '' throat '' , or slight constriction , to create the proper draft for complete combustion of the fuel ; the draft carries more air ( oxygen ) past the flame , helping to produce a smokeless light , which is brighter than an open flame would produce the burner uses a wick , usually made of cotton , that is made of a wide , flat wick rolled into a tube , the seam of which is then stitched together to form the complete wick the tubular wick is then mounted into a '' carrier '' , which is some form of a toothed rack that engages into the gears of the wick-raising mechanism of the burner and allows the wick to be raised and lowered the mantle typically contains thorium or other rare-earth salts ; on first use the cloth burns away , and the rare-earth salts are converted to oxides , leaving a very fragile structure , which incandesces ( glows brightly ) upon exposure to the heat of the burner flame mantle lamps typically use fuel faster than a flat-wick lamp , but slower than a center-draught round-wick , as they depend on a small flame heating a mantle , rather than having all the light coming from the flame itself like flat- and round-wick lamps , they can be adjusted for brightness ; however , caution must be used , because if set too high , the lamp chimney and the mantle can become covered with black areas of soot a kerosene lantern , also known as a '' barn lantern '' or '' hurricane lantern '' , is a flat-wick lamp made for portable and outdoor use the earliest portable kerosene '' glass globe '' lanterns , of the 1850s and 1860s , were of the dead-flame type , meaning that it had an open wick , but the airflow to the flame was strictly controlled in an upward motion by a combination of vents at the bottom of the burner and an open topped chimney later lanterns , such as the hot-blast and cold-blast lanterns , took this airflow control even further by partially or fully enclosing the wick in a '' deflector '' or '' burner cone '' and then channeling the air to be supplied for combustion at the wick while at the same time pre-heating the air for combustion as noted in the patent , the '' novel mode of constructing a lantern whereby the wind , instead of acting upon the flame in such a manner as to extinguish it , serves to support or sustain and prevent the extinguishment thereof '' this improvement essentially redirected wind which might normally tend to extinguish the flame of an unprotected dead-flame lantern , instead is redirected , slowed , pre-heated , and supplied to the burner to actually support and promote the combustion of the fuel this design is similar to his earlier '' hot-blast '' design , except that the oxygen-depleted hot combustion byproducts are redirected and prevented from recirculating back to the burner by redesigning the intake products , so that only oxygen-rich , fresh air is drawn from the atmosphere into the lamp ( '' the inlets for fresh air are placed out of the ascending current of products of combustion , and said products are thereby prevented from entering the air intake '' ) flat-wick lamps have the lowest light output , center-draft round-wick lamps have 3â€“4 times the output of flat-wick lamps , and pressurized lamps have higher output yet ; the range is from 8 to 100 lumens
