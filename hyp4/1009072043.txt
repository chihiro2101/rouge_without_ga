the boston women 's health book collective : our bodies ourselves , pages 489–491 , new york : touchstone book , 2005 typically , a diagnosis of postpartum depression is considered after signs and symptoms persist for at least two weeks persistent sadness , anxiousness or '' empty '' mood severe mood swings webmd : understanding post partum depression frustration , irritability , restlessness , anger feelings of hopelessness or helplessness guilt , shame , worthlessness low self-esteem numbness , emptiness exhaustion inability to be comforted trouble bonding with the baby feeling inadequate in taking care of the baby thoughts of self-harm or suicide diminished ability to make decisions and think clearly lack of concentration and poor memory fear that you can not care for the baby or fear of the baby worry about harming self , baby , or partner when at rest , that is not cued by anything in the environment , mothers with ppd have less activity in the left frontal lobe and increased activity in the right frontal lobe when compared with healthy controls depressed mothers show greater neural activity in the right amygdala toward non-infant emotional cues as well as reduced connectivity between the amygdala and right insular cortex - a pattern consistently found in those with depression and anxiety therefore , in the dsm-5 postpartum depression is diagnosed under '' depressive disorder with peripartum onset '' , in which '' peripartum onset '' is defined as anytime either during pregnancy or within the four weeks following delivery in rare cases , or about 1 to 2 per 1,000 , the postpartum depression appears as postpartum psychosis in the united states , postpartum depression is one of the leading causes of annual reported infanticide incidence rate of about 8 per 100,000 births when a child is in infancy , these problems can include unusual amounts of crying ( colic ) and not having normal sleeping patterns these problems can have a cyclical effect , meaning that they can further agitate the mother 's postpartum depression and can even lead to the mother further developing postpartum depression hormonal and physical changes , personal and family history of depression , and the stress of caring for a new baby all may contribute to the development of postpartum depression a review of exploratory studies in ppd have observed that women with ppd , have more dramatic changes in hpa axis activity , however directionality of specific hormone increases or decreases remain mixed despite the biological and psychosocial changes that may accompany pregnancy and the postpartum period , most women are not diagnosed with ppd sleep deprivation can lead to physical discomfort and exhaustion , which can contribute to the symptoms of postpartum depression while the causes of ppd are not understood , a number of factors have been suggested to increase the risk : prenatal depression or anxiety a personal or family history of depression moderate to severe premenstrual symptoms stressful life events experienced during pregnancy postpartum blues birth-related psychological trauma birth trauma ( physical ) history of sexual abuse childhood trauma previous stillbirth or miscarriage formula-feeding rather than breast-feeding cigarette smoking low self-esteem childcare or life stress low social support poor marital relationship or single marital status low socioeconomic status a lack of strong emotional support from spouse , partner , family , or friends infant temperament problems/colic unintended pregnancy breastfeeding difficulties administration of labor-inducing medication synthetic oxytocin of these risk factors a history of depression , and cigarette smoking have been shown to have additive effects contrastingly , some factors almost certainly attribute to the cause of postpartum depression , such as lack of social support african american mothers have been shown to have the highest risk of ppd at 25 % , while asian mothers had the lowest at 11.5 % , after controlling for social factors such as age , income , education , marital status , and baby 's health one of the strongest predictors of paternal ppd is having a partner who has ppd , with fathers developing ppd 50 % of the time when their female partner has ppd further , violence against women was defined as '' any act of gender-based violence that results in , or is likely to result in , physical , sexual , or psychological harm or suffering to women '' psychological and cultural factors associated with increased incidence of postpartum depression include family history of depression , stressful life events during early puberty or pregnancy , anxiety or depression during pregnancy , and low social support the criteria required for the diagnosis of postpartum depression are the same as those required to make a diagnosis of non-childbirth related major depression or minor depression the criteria include at least five of the following nine symptoms , within a two-week period : feelings of sadness , emptiness , or hopelessness , nearly every day , for most of the day or the observation of a depressed mood made by others loss of interest or pleasure in activities weight loss or decreased appetite changes in sleep patterns feelings of restlessness loss of energy feelings of worthlessness or guilt loss of concentration or increased indecisiveness recurrent thoughts of death , with or without plans of suicide postpartum psychosis is not a formal diagnosis , but is widely used to describe a emergency psychiatry that appears to occur in about 1 in a 1000 pregnancies , in which symptoms of high mood and racing thoughts ( mania ) , depression , severe confusion , loss of inhibition , paranoia , hallucinations and delusions begin suddenly in the first two weeks after delivery ; the symptoms vary and can change quickly about half of women who experience postpartum psychosis have no risk factors ; but a prior history of mental illness , especially bipolar disorder , a history of prior episodes of postpartum psychosis , or a family history put some at a higher risk postpartum psychosis often requires hospitalization , where treatment is antipsychotic medications , mood stabilizers , and in cases of strong risk for suicide , electroconvulsive therapy '' across different cultures , traditional rituals for postpartum care may be preventative for ppd , but are more effective when the support is welcomed by the mother social interventions include individual counseling and peer support , while psychological interventions include cognitive behavioral therapy ( cbt ) and interpersonal therapy ( ipt ) other forms of therapy , such as group therapy , home visits , counseling , and ensuring greater sleep for the mother may also have a benefit there is evidence which suggests that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( ssris ) are effective treatment for ppd the first-line anti-depressant medication of choice is sertraline , an ssri , as very little of the it passes into the breast milk and , as a result , to the child therefore , it is not completely clear which antidepressants , if any , are most effective for treatment of ppd , and for whom antidepressants would be a better option than non-pharmacotherapy some studies show that hormone therapy may be effective in women with ppd , supported by the idea that the drop in estrogen and progesterone levels post-delivery contribute to depressive symptoms however , there is some controversy with this form of treatment because estrogen should not be given to people who are at higher risk of blood clots , which include women up to 12 weeks after delivery united states within the united states , the prevalence of postpartum depression was lower than the global approximation at 11.5 % but varied between states from as low as 8 % to as high as 20.1 % the highest prevalence in the us is found among women who are american indian/alaska natives or asian/pacific islanders , possess less than 12 years of education , are unmarried , smoke during pregnancy , experience over two stressful life events , or who ’ s full term infant is low-birthweight or was admitted to a newborn intensive care unit even with the variety of studies , it is difficult to find the exact rate as approximately 60 % of us women are not diagnosed and of those diagnosed approximately 50 % are not treated for ppd based on her descriptions of visions of demons and conversations she wrote about that she had with religious figures like god and the virgin mary , historians have identified what margery kempe was suffering from as '' postnatal psychosis '' and not postpartum depression a 16th century physician , castello branco , documented a case of postpartum depression without the formal title as a relatively healthy woman who suffered from melancholy after childbirth , remained insane for a month , and recovered with treatment it was n't until the onset of the twentieth century that the attitude of the scientific community shifted once again : the consensus amongst gynecologists and other medical experts was to turn away from the idea of diseased reproductive organs and instead towards more '' scientific theories '' that encompassed a broadening medical perspective on mental illness when this spirit is unsatisfied and venting resentment , it causes the mother to experience frequent crying , loss of appetite , and trouble sleeping , known collectively as '' sakit meroyan '' globalization and migration can disconnect women from their traditional communities of maternal support , which can be positive or negative depending on the traditions and on the mother 's wishes some chinese women postpartum confinement that is known as '' doing the month '' ( confinement ) in which they spend the first 30 days after giving birth resting in bed , while the mother or mother-in-law takes care of domestic duties and childcare in addition , the new mother is not allowed to bathe or shower , wash her hair , clean her teeth , leave the house , or be blown by the wind some argue that more resources in the form of policies , programs , and health objectives need to be directed to the care of those with ppd
