the fragility of the blood vessels can cause problems during surgery ; and wound healing is often delayed or incomplete ligaments in neck are unable to heal properly , therefore , the neck structure does not have the ability to support the skull , which can then sink into the brain stem blocking the normal flow of cerebrospinal fluid , leading to issues related to the autonomic nervous system failing to work properly initially , prevalence estimates ranged from one in 250,000 to 500,000 people , but these estimates were soon found to be too low , as more was studied about the disorders , and medical professionals became more adept at diagnosis this group of disorders affects connective tissues across the body , with symptoms most typically present in the joints , skin , and blood vessels a few are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern , which means both copies of the gene must be altered for a person to be affected by a disorder instability of almost all joints can happen , but appears most often in the lower and upper extremities , with the wrist , fingers , shoulder , knee , hip , and ankle being most common after surgery , the degree of stabilization , pain reduction , and people 's satisfaction can improve , but surgery does not guarantee an optimal result ; affected peoples and surgeons report being dissatisfied with the results deformities of the spine , such as scoliosis ( curvature of the spine ) , kyphosis ( a thoracic hump ) , tethered spinal cord syndrome , craniocervical instability , and occipitoatlantoaxial hypermobility may also be present cognitive behavioural therapy is used in all chronic pain patients , especially those who have severe , chronic , life-controlling pain that is unresponsive to treatment there can be an early onset of advanced osteoarthritis , chronic degenerative joint disease , swan neck deformity of the fingers , and boutonniere deformity of the fingers for example , the chance of being a carrier for dermatosparaxis eds is one in 248 in ashkenazi jews , whereas the prevalence of this variation in the general population is one in 2,000 skin may tear and bruise easily , and may heal with abnormal atrophic scars , and atrophic scars that look like cigarette paper are a sign seen including in those whose skin might appear otherwise normal also , it can be misdiagnosed as eds due to common symptoms , including fatigue , pain , gastrointestinal complaints , or cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction children should be taught that demonstrating the unusual positions that they can maintain due to loose joints should not be done , as this may cause early degeneration of the joints it was originally notated in the peruvian paso and thought to be a condition of overwork and older age , but it is being recognized in all age groups and all activity levels the instability of joints , leading to subluxations and joint pain , often requires surgical intervention in people with eds drag queen and winner of the 11th season of rupaul 's drag race yvie oddly drag race 's yvie oddly on living with ehlers danos syndrome eric the actor , a regular caller to the howard stern show actress and activist jameela jamil has heds
