menarche is the culmination of a series of physiological and anatomic processes of puberty : attainment of a sufficient body mass ( typically 17 % body fat ) over an interval of about 2 to 3 years , estrogen stimulates growth of the uterus ( as well as height growth , breast growth , widening of the pelvis , and increased regional adipose tissue ) no specific hormonal signal for menarche is known ; menarche as a discrete event is thought to be the relatively chance result of the gradual thickening of the endometrium induced by rising but fluctuating pubertal estrogen in postmenarchal girls , about 80 % of the cycles were anovulatory in the first year after menarche , 50 % in the third and 10 % in the sixth year although unlikely , it is possible for a girl who has engaged in sexual intercourse shortly before her menarche to conceive and become pregnant , which would delay her menarche until after the end of the pregnancy when menarche occurs , it confirms that the girl has had a gradual estrogen-induced growth of the uterus , especially the endometrium , and that the '' outflow tract '' from the uterus , through the cervix to the vagina , is open in very rare instances , menarche may occur at an unusually early age , preceding thelarche and other signs of puberty when menarche has failed to occur for more than three years after thelarche , or beyond 16 years of age , the delay is referred to as primary amenorrhea some studies have shown that there may be an association between early or late-age menarche and cardiovascular disease , although the mechanism of the association is not well understood there is conflicting evidence regarding the association between obesity and timing of menarche ; a meta-analysis and systematic review has determined that more studies must be conducted to make any definitive conclusions about this association in most of these studies menarche was specifically examined , assuming it to be a valid '' proxy '' for the more general process of puberty in comparison with the effects of genetics , nutrition , and general health , social influences are small , shifting timing by a few months rather than years some of the aspects of family structure and function reported to be independently associated with earlier menarche antenatal and early childhood being non-white having experienced pre-eclampsia in the womb being a singleton low birthweight not having been breast-fed previous exposure to smoking high-conflict family relationships increased incidence of childhood obesity there is more uncertainty and mixed evidence as to whether milder degrees of stress or early-life under-nutrition can accelerate puberty in girls as would be predicted by life history theory and demonstrated in many other mammals the understanding of these environmental effects is incomplete and the following observations and cautions are relevant : mechanisms of these social effects are unknown , though a variety of physiological processes , including pheromones , have been suggested based on animal research most older estimates of average timing of menarche were based on observation of a small homogeneous population not necessarily representative of the larger population , or based on recall by adult women , which is also susceptible to various forms of error most sources agree that the average age of menarche in girls in modern societies has declined , though the reasons and the degree remain subjects of controversy from the sixth to the fifteenth centuries in europe , most women reached menarche on average at about 14 , between the ages of 12 and 15 a 2011 study found that each 1 & nbsp ; kg/m 2 increase in childhood body-mass index ( bmi ) can be expected to result in a 6.5 % higher absolute risk of early menarche ( before age 12 years ) girls are menstruating by 13.8 years of age , with a median age of 12.4 years age at menarche for non-hispanic black girls was significantly earlier than that of white girls at 10 % , 25 % , and 50 % of those who had attained menarche , whereas non-white mexican american girls were only slightly earlier than the white girls at 25 % in the united states , public schools have a sex education program that teaches girls about menstruation and what to expect at the onset of menarche ( often this takes place during the 4th grade ) historically menstruation has been a social taboo and girls were taught about menarche and menstruation by their mothers or a female role model carrie white experiences her first period as she showers after the school gym class , and unaware of what is happening to her , she panics and pleads for help , but the other girls respond by bullying her girls experiencing their first period is part of many movies , though not central to their plot , including the blue lagoon ( 1980 ) , the company of wolves ( 1984 ) , my girl ( 1991 ) , return to the blue lagoon ( 1991 ) , a walk on the moon ( 1999 ) .
