) is applied in a context or setting similar to that which applies to the control group can be isolated from other activities—and the purpose of the study is to assess this isolated effect has a short timescale between its implementation and maturity of its effects and the causal mechanisms : are either known to the researchers , or else all possible alternatives can be tested do not involve significant feedback mechanisms between the intervention group and external environments have a stable and predictable relationship to exogenous factors would act in the same way if the control group and intervention group were reversed some examples of scientific organizations ' considering rcts or systematic reviews of rcts to be the highest-quality evidence available are : as of 1998 , the national health and medical research council of australia designated '' level i '' evidence as that '' obtained from a systematic review of all relevant randomised controlled trials '' and '' level ii '' evidence as that '' obtained from at least one properly designed randomised controlled trial the 2010 consort statement specifies that authors and editors should not use the terms '' single-blind '' , '' double-blind '' , and '' triple-blind '' ; instead , reports of blinded rct should discuss '' if done , who was blinded after assignment to interventions ( for example , participants , care providers , those assessing outcomes ) and how in 2008 a study concluded that the results of unblinded rcts tended to be biased toward beneficial effects only if the rcts ' outcomes were subjective as opposed to objective ; for example , in an rct of treatments for multiple sclerosis , unblinded neurologists ( but not the blinded neurologists ) felt that the treatments were beneficial the major types of restricted randomization used in rcts are : randomized block design or blocked randomization : a '' block size '' and '' allocation ratio '' ( number of subjects in one group versus the other group ) are specified , and subjects are allocated randomly within each block '' for issues involving '' therapy/prevention , aetiology/harm '' , the oxford centre for evidence-based medicine as of 2011 defined '' level 1a '' evidence as a systematic review of rcts that are consistent with each other , and '' level 1b '' evidence as an '' individual rct ( with narrow confidence interval ) from most to least common in the healthcare literature , the major categories of rct study designs are : parallel study – each participant is randomly assigned to a group , and all the participants in the group receive ( or do not receive ) an intervention reviewers examine the study results for potential problems with design that could lead to unreliable results ( for example by creating a systematic bias ) , evaluate the study in the context of related studies and other evidence , and evaluate whether the study can be reasonably considered to have proven its conclusions it is recommended that allocation concealment methods be included in an rct 's protocol , and that the allocation concealment methods should be reported in detail in a publication of an rct 's results ; however , a 2005 study determined that most rcts have unclear allocation concealment in their protocols , in their publications , or both these include the '' unique time period assessment bias '' , the '' background traits remain constant assumption '' , the '' average treatment effects limitation '' , the '' simple treatment at the individual level limitation '' , the '' all preconditions are fully met assumption '' , the '' quantitative variable limitation '' and the '' placebo only or conventional treatment only limitation '' . '' although subjects almost always provide informed consent for their participation in an rct , studies since 1982 have documented that rct subjects may believe that they are certain to receive treatment that is best for them personally ; that is , they do not understand the difference between research and treatment nevertheless , the return on investment of rcts may be high , in that the same study projected that the 28 rcts produced a '' net benefit to society at 10-years '' of 46 times the cost of the trials program , based on evaluating a quality-adjusted life year as equal to the prevailing mean per capita gross domestic product first is choosing a randomization procedure to generate an unpredictable sequence of allocations ; this may be a simple random assignment of patients to any of the groups at equal probabilities , may be '' restricted '' , or may be '' adaptive if a disruptive innovation in medical technology is developed , it may be difficult to test this ethically in an rct if it becomes '' obvious '' that the control subjects have poorer outcomes—either due to other foregoing testing , or within the initial phase of the rct itself '' unlike allocation concealment , blinding is sometimes inappropriate or impossible to perform in an rct ; for example , if an rct involves a treatment in which active participation of the patient is necessary ( e.g '' allocation concealment '' ( defined as '' the procedure for protecting the randomization process so that the treatment to be allocated is not known before the patient is entered into the study '' ) is important in rcts two other lines of reasoning question rcts ' contribution to scientific knowledge beyond other types of studies : if study designs are ranked by their potential for new discoveries , then anecdotal evidence would be at the top of the list , followed by observational studies , followed by rcts at least two types of '' adaptive '' randomization procedures have been used in rcts , but much less frequently than simple or restricted randomization : covariate-adaptive randomization , of which one type is minimization : the probability of being assigned to a group varies in order to minimize '' covariate imbalance he proposed the following eight criteria for the use of rcts in contexts where interventions must change human behaviour to be effective : the intervention : has not been applied to all members of a unique group of people ( e.g non-random '' systematic '' methods of group assignment , such as alternating subjects between one group and the other , can cause '' limitless contamination possibilities '' and can cause a breach of allocation concealment traditionally , blinded rcts have been classified as '' single-blind '' , '' double-blind '' , or '' triple-blind '' ; however , in 2001 and 2006 two studies showed that these terms have different meanings for different people if the randomization procedure causes an imbalance in covariates related to the outcome across groups , estimates of effect may be biased if not adjusted for the covariates ( which may be unmeasured and therefore impossible to adjust for ) finally , zelen 's design , which has been used for some rcts , randomizes subjects before they provide informed consent , which may be ethical for rcts of screening and selected therapies , but is likely unethical '' for most therapeutic trials although arguments have been made that this approach is more ethical than other types of randomization when the probability that a treatment is effective or ineffective increases during the course of an rct , ethicists have not yet studied the approach in detail adaptive biased-coin randomization methods ( of which urn randomization is the most widely known type ) : in these relatively uncommon methods , the probability of being assigned to a group decreases if the group is overrepresented and increases if the group is underrepresented to underscore the need for peer review and the danger of over-generalizing conclusions , two boston-area medical researchers performed a randomized controlled trial in which they randomly assigned either a parachute or an empty backpack to 23 volunteers who jumped from either a biplane or a helicopter due to the costs of running rcts , these usually only inspect one variable or very few variables , rarely reflecting the full picture of a complicated medical situation ; whereas the case report , for example , can detail many aspects of the patient 's medical situation ( e.g this may occur when covariates that affect the outcome are not equally distributed between treatment groups , and the treatment effect is confounded with the effect of the covariates ( i.e an rct may be blinded , ( also called '' masked '' ) by '' procedures that prevent study participants , caregivers , or outcome assessors from knowing which intervention was received the risk of selection bias is highest when previous treatment assignments are known ( as in unblinded studies ) or can be guessed ( perhaps if a drug has distinctive side effects ) this type of randomization can be combined with '' stratified randomization '' , for example by center in a multicenter trial , to '' ensure good balance of participant characteristics in each group in 2002 and 2004 , however , published rcts from the women 's health initiative claimed that women taking hormone replacement therapy with estrogen plus progestin had a higher rate of myocardial infarctions than women on a placebo , and that estrogen-only hormone replacement therapy caused no reduction in the incidence of coronary heart disease the authors of the 2000 findings questioned the belief that '' observational studies should not be used for defining evidence-based medical care '' and that rcts ' results are '' evidence of the highest grade '' a second and more practical issue is allocation concealment , which refers to the stringent precautions taken to ensure that the group assignment of patients are not revealed prior to definitively allocating them to their respective groups '' however , a 2001 study published in journal of the american medical association concluded that '' discrepancies beyond chance do occur and differences in estimated magnitude of treatment effect are very common '' between observational studies and rcts to improve the reporting of rcts in the medical literature , an international group of scientists and editors published consolidated standards of reporting trials ( consort ) statements in 1996 , 2001 and 2010 , and these have become widely accepted a '' pure '' intention-to-treat analysis is '' possible only when complete outcome data are available '' for all randomized subjects ; when some outcome data are missing , options include analyzing only cases with known outcomes and using imputed data on the other hand , a 2008 study of 146 meta-analysis concluded that the results of rcts with inadequate or unclear allocation concealment tended to be biased toward beneficial effects only if the rcts ' outcomes were subjective as opposed to objective '' rcts without blinding are referred to as '' unblinded '' , '' open '' , or ( if the intervention is a medication ) '' open-label '' nevertheless , the more that analyses can include all participants in the groups to which they were randomized , the less bias that an rct will be subject to for example , a block size of 6 and an allocation ratio of 2:1 would lead to random assignment of 4 subjects to one group and 2 to the other
