gustav and his father erik supported the party of sten sture the younger , regent of sweden from 1512 , and its struggle against the danish king christian ii flanked by the councilors of lübeck , gustav eriksson was brought to strängnäs cathedral where the king sat down in the choir with the swedish privy councilors on one side , and the lübeck representatives on the other eric 's most trusted counsellor , jöran persson ( 1530–68 ) , took much of the blame for the actions directed against the nobility during eric xiv 's reign and was executed shortly after john iii ascended to the throne sigismund iii vasa was born when his parents , john iii and catherine jagiellon , were held prisoner by john 's brother king eric xiv , but john replaced eric in 1568 his polish connection came through his mother , daughter of sigismund i the old , and the jagiellonian dynasty had ruled poland and then the polish–lithuanian commonwealth since 1386 from that time his official name and title became '' sigismund iii , by the grace of god , king of poland , grand duke of lithuania , ruthenia , prussia , masovia , samogitia , livonia and also hereditary king of the swedes , goths and wends '' ; after his father died in 1592 , he added '' hereditary king of the swedes , goths , and vandals '' english translation : sigismund iii , by the grace of god , king of poland , grand duke of lithuania , ruthenia , prussia , masovia , samogitia , livonia , and also hereditary king of the swedes , goths and vandals however , as was often the case with the polish electoral monarchy , the outcome was strongly contested by the '' losers '' and the greedy and stubborn polish nobility who backed maximilian iii , archduke of austria he immediately agreed to give up several royal privileges to the sejm ( parliament ) of the commonwealth in the hope of winning over some of his enemies and settling the disputed election sigismund certainly valued the swedish throne and upon learning about the death of his father , and the pretensions to the throne of his uncle , duke charles ix of sweden , he asked the sejm ( polish parliament ) for permission to leave the commonwealth and go to sweden , where he could secure the swedish crown charles at first looked ready to negotiate but in fact he was playing for time , trying to confirm his power at another riksdag ( in arboga ) , recruiting peasants for his army , and isolating sigismund 's followers after initial successes ( the taking of kalmar and defeating charles ' troops at stegeborg ) , sigismund 's forces were defeated on september 25 , 1598 , at the battle of stångebro , ( also known as the battle of stångebro ) the new king of sweden was charles ix of sweden , and the polish–swedish union was dissolved after barely seven years of existence the polish–muscovite war or the polish–russian war ( 1605–1618 ) , in poland known as the dimitriads , took place in the early 17th century as a sequence of military conflicts and eastward invasions carried out by the polish–lithuanian commonwealth , or the private armies and mercenaries led by the magnates ( the commonwealth aristocracy ) , when the russian tsardom was torn by a series of civil wars , the time most commonly referred to in the russian history as the '' time of troubles '' , sparked by the russian dynastic crisis and overall internal chaos the sides and their goals changed several times during this conflict : the polish–lithuanian commonwealth was not formally at war with russia until 1609 , and various russian factions fought amongst themselves , allied with the commonwealth and other countries or fighting against them the aims of the various factions changed frequently as well as the scale of the parties ' goals , which ranged from minor border adjustments to imposing the polish kings or the polish-backed impostors ' claims to the russian throne and even the creation of a new state by forming a union between the commonwealth and russia in the first stage , certain commonwealth szlachta ( nobility ) , encouraged by some boyar ( russian aristocracy ) , but without the official consent of the polish king sigismund iii vasa , attempted to exploit russia 's weakness and intervene in its civil war by supporting the impostors for the tsardom , false dmitriy i and later false dmitriy ii , against the crowned tsars , boris godunov and vasili shuiski in response to this alliance , the polish king sigismund iii decided to intervene officially and to declare war upon russia , aiming to weaken sweden 's ally and to gain territorial concessions hetman of the crown stanisław żółkiewski held a triumphal entry by the kraków suburb of the royal palace , leading with him the prisoners : the russian tsar wasyl iv szujski , his brothers : dimitri szujski with his wife - grand duchess ekaterina grigoryevna , daughter grigory malyuta skuratov and ivan shuysky mikhail shein , and filaret , the non-canonical patriarch of moscow and all russia after early commonwealth victories ( battle of klushino ) , which culminated in polish forces entering moscow in 1610 , sigismund 's son , prince władysław iv vasa , was briefly elected tsar with the intensification of the polish–muscovite war ( 1605–18 ) , in 1609 , the royal family moved to their residence in vilnius , capital of the grand duchy of lithuania likely , the failure of this campaign showed władysław the limits of royal power in poland , as major factors for the failure included significant autonomy of the military commanders , which did not see władysław as their superior , and lack of funds for the army , as the polish parliament ( sejm ) refused to subsidize the war in the pacta conventa , władysław pledged himself to fund a military school and equipment ; to find a way to fund a naval fleet ; to maintain current alliances ; not to raise armies , give offices or military ranks to foreigners , negotiate peace treaties or declare war without the sejm 's approval ; not to take a wife without the senate 's approval ; to convince his brothers to take an oath to the commonwealth ; and to transfer the profits from the royal mint to the royal treasury rather than to a private treasury his relationship with the habsburgs was relatively strong ; although he was not above carrying some negotiations with their enemies , like france , he refused cardinal richelieu 's 1635 proposal of an alliance and a full-out war against them , despite potential lure of territorial gains in silesia in the meantime , władysław still tried to take a leading role in european politics , and negotiate a peaceful settlement to the thirty years ' war , a settlement which he hoped would ease his way into regaining the swedish crown the reign of the last of the vasas in the polish–lithuanian commonwealth would be dominated by the russo-polish war ( 1654–67 ) , followed by the war with sweden ( '' the deluge '' ) , the scene for which had been set by the commonwealth 's two previous vasa kings in the course of a few years , the commonwealth rose to force the swedes out of poland , ending the short-lived intrusions and campaigns , however , at a high cost although the reign of john casimir is remembered to be one of the most disastrous and perhaps most unsuccessful in the history of poland and the polish–lithuanian commonwealth , he is often referred to as the '' warrior king '' that fought bravely to save his nation and his people on 16 september 1668 , grief-stricken after the death of his wife in the previous year , john ii casimir abdicated the throne of the polish–lithuanian commonwealth , and returned to france , where he joined the jesuits and became abbot of abbey of saint-germain-des-prés in paris before his death john casimir intended to return to poland , however shortly before the journey in autumn 1672 he fell dangerously ill to the news of the fall of kamieniec podolski , which was seized by the ottomans the french , who were secretly in contact with him during his stay in the abbey , were astonished by such a great affection of the king to remember the loss of his kingdom , and so concerned about the loss of only one city the hostility of poland and the breakup of russia involved him in overseas contests for the possession of livonia and ingria , the polish–swedish war ( 1600–1611 ) and the ingrian war , while his pretensions to claim lappland brought upon him a war with denmark in the last year of his reign gustavus adolphus was born in stockholm as the oldest son of duke charles of the vasa dynasty and his second wife , christina of holstein-gottorp the staunch protestant duke charles forced the catholic sigismund to let go of the throne of sweden in 1599 , a part of the preliminary religious strife before the thirty years ' war , and reigned as regent before taking the throne as charles ix of sweden in 1604 upon his father 's death in october 1611 , a sixteen-year-old gustavus inherited the throne ( declared of age and able to reign himself at seventeen as of 16 december ) , as well as an ongoing succession of occasionally belligerent dynastic disputes with his polish cousin his reign became famous from his actions a few years later when in june 1630 he landed in germany , marking the swedish intervention in the thirty years ' war gustavus was married to maria eleonora of brandenburg , the daughter of john sigismund , elector of brandenburg , and chose the prussian city of elbląg as the base for his operations in germany his involvement in the thirty years ' war gave rise to the saying that he was the incarnation of '' the lion of the north '' , or as it is put in german '' der löwe von mitternacht '' gustav ii adolf 's success in making sweden one of the great powers of europe , and perhaps the most important power in the thirty years ' war after france and spain , was due not only to his military brilliance , but also to important institutional reforms in sweden 's government gustav i ( born 1496 , reigned 1523–1560 ) eric xiv ( reigned 1560–1568 ) john iii ( reigned 1568–1592 ) sigismund ( reigned 1592–1599 ) charles ix ( reigned 1599–1611 ; officially became king in march 1604 ) gustavus adolphus ( gustav adolf the great ) ( reigned 1611–1632 ) christina ( reigned 1632–1654 ) in 1654 christina , the daughter of gustavus adolphus , the protestant champion of the thirty years ' war , abdicated , converted to roman catholicism and left the country the kings of the house of holstein-gottorp , which produced the kings of sweden from 1751 to 1818 , emphasized their vasa descent through a female line the current ruling house of bernadotte similarly claims a vasa mantle : charles xiv was an adopted son of charles xiii ; his son oscar i married a vasa descendant josephine of leuchtenberg ; their grandson gustav v married victoria of baden who was a great-grandchild of gustav iv adolf of the house holstein-gottorp image : polish house of vasa coa.svg thumb coat of arms of the polish branch of the house of vasa as elected kings of poland ( lithuania and ruthenia ) and rightful hereditary kings of sweden ( finland and estonia ) sigismund iii vasa ( 1587–1632 ) władysław iv ( 1632–1648 ) john ii casimir ( 1648–1668 ) john iii of sweden married catherine jagellonka , the sister of sigismund ii augustus when sigismund ii of poland died without issue , the son of john iii of sweden and catherine jagellonka was elected king of poland and grand duke of lithuania as sigismund iii in 1587 we thus have two houses of vasa from this point onwards : the senior , catholic branch ruling in poland and lithuania , and the cadet , protestant branch ruling in sweden
