bce on the order of darius the great , george rawlinson , noted in his translation of history of herodotus , book vii , p 378 these people were reported to be mainly interested in settling in the kingdom of urartu , later part of armenia , and shacusen in utik derived its name from them ) the behistun inscription initially only gave one entry for saka , they were however further differentiated later into three groups : the sakā paradraya – '' saka beyond the sea '' , a name added after the scythian campaign of darius i north of the danube an additional term is found in two inscriptions elsewhere : the sakā para sugdam – '' saka beyond sugda ( sogdia ) '' , a term was used by darius for the people who formed the limits of his empire at the opposite end to the kingdom of kush ( the ethiopians ) , therefore should be located at the eastern edge of his empire it has been suggested that the sakā haumavargā may be the sakā para sugdam , therefore sakā haumavargā is argued by some to be located further east than the sakā tigraxaudā , perhaps at the pamir mountains or xinjiang , although syr darya is considered to be their more likely location given that the name says '' beyond sogdia '' rather than bactria john manuel cook , in the cambridge history of iran , states : '' the persians gave the single name sakā both to the nomads whom they encountered between the hungry steppe ( mirzacho ' l ) and the caspian , and equally to those north of the danube and black sea against whom darius later campaigned ; and the greeks and assyrians called all those who were known to them by the name skuthai ( iškuzai ) journal of the royal asiatic society of great britain & ireland by royal asiatic society of great britain and ireland-page-323 modern scholars now usually use the term saka to refer to iranian peoples who inhabited the northern and eastern eurasian steppe and the tarim basin like the scythians of the pontic steppe , to whom they were related , the saka were racially europoid and ultimately traced their origin to the andronovo culture '' the rich kurgan burials in pazyryk , siberia probably were those of saka chieftains '' '' analysis of the clothing , which has analogies in the complex of saka clothes , particularly in pazyryk , led wang binghua ( 1987 , 42 ) to the conclusion that they are related to the saka culture two saka tribes named in the behistun inscription , sakā tigraxaudā ( '' saka with pointy hats/caps '' ) and the sakā haumavargā ( '' haoma-drinking saka '' ) , may be located to the east of the caspian sea greek historians wrote of the wars between the saka and the medes , as well as their wars against cyrus the great of the persian achaemenid empire where saka women were said to fight alongside their men according to herodotus , cyrus the great confronted the massagetae , a people related to the saka , while campaigning to the east of the caspian sea and was killed in the battle in 530 bc the territories of saka were absorbed into the achaemenid empire as part of chorasmia that included much of the amu darya ( oxus ) and the syr darya ( jaxartes ) , and the saka then supplied the achaemenid army with large number of mounted bowmen '' the ethnonym saka appears in ancient iranian and indian sources as the name of the large family of iranian nomads called scythians by the classical western sources and sai by the chinese ( gk the yuehzhi , who originally lived between tängri tagh ( tian shan ) and dunhuang of gansu , china , were assaulted and forced to flee from the hexi corridor of gansu by the forces of the xiongnu ruler modu chanyu , who conquered the area in 177–176 bc the saka also moved southwards toward the pamirs and northern india , where they settled in kashmir , and eastward , to settle in some of the oasis-states of tarim basin sites , like yanqi ( 焉耆 , karasahr ) and qiuci ( 龜茲 , kucha ) the yuehzhi , themselves under attacks from another nomadic tribe , the wusun , in 133–132 bc , moved , again , from the ili and chu valleys , and occupied the country of daxia , ( 大夏 , '' bactria '' ) the ancient greco-roman geographer strabo noted that the four tribes that took down the bactrians in the greek and roman account – the asii , pasianoi , tokharoi and sakaraulai – came from land north of the syr darya where the ili and chu valleys are located identification of these four tribes varies , but sakaraulai may indicate an ancient saka tribe , the tokharoi is possibly the yuezhi , and while the asioi had been proposed to be groups such as the wusun or alans rené grousset wrote of the migration of the saka : '' the saka , under pressure from the yueh-chih yuezhi , overran sogdiana and then bactria , there taking the place of the greeks '' then , '' thrust back in the south by the yueh-chih , '' the saka occupied '' the saka country , sakastana , whence the modern persian seistan according to harold walter bailey , the territory of drangiana ( now in afghanistan and pakistan ) became known as '' land of the sakas '' , and was called sakastāna in the persian language of contemporary iran , in armenian as sakastan , with similar equivalents in pahlavi , greek , sogdian , syriac , arabic , and the middle persian tongue used in turfan , xinjiang , china this is attested in a contemporary kharosthi inscription found on the mathura lion capital belonging to the saka kingdom of the indo-scythians ( 200 bc – 400 ad ) in north india , roughly the same time the chinese record that the saka had invaded and settled the country of jibin 罽賓 ( i.e migrations of the 2nd and 1st century bc have left traces in sogdia and bactria , but they can not firmly be attributed to the saka , similarly with the sites of sirkap and taxila in ancient india the shakya clan of india , to which gautama buddha , called śākyamuni '' sage of the shakyas '' , belonged , were also likely sakas , as michael witzel and christopher i this is attested in a contemporary kharosthi inscription found on the mathura lion capital belonging to the saka kingdom of the indo-scythians ( 200 bc – 400 ad ) in northern india , bailey , h.w ( 1996 ) '' khotanese saka literature '' , in

in the persian language of contemporary iran the territory of drangiana was called sakastāna , in armenian as sakastan , with similar equivalents in pahlavi , greek , sogdian , syriac , arabic , and the middle persian tongue used in turfan , xinjiang , china as a consequence of the han–xiongnu war spanning from 133 bce to 89 ce , the tarim basin ( now xinjiang , northwest china ) , including khotan and kashgar , fell under han chinese influence , beginning with the reign of emperor wu of han ( r the official language of khotan was initially gandhari prakrit written in kharosthi , and coins from khotan dated to the 1st century bear dual inscriptions in chinese and gandhari prakrit , indicating links of khotan to both india and china surviving documents however suggest that an iranian language was used by the people of the kingdom for a long time third-century ad documents in prakrit from nearby shanshan record the title for the king of khotan as hinajha ( i.e this , along with the fact that the king 's recorded regnal periods were given as the khotanese kṣuṇa , '' implies an established connection between the iranian inhabitants and the royal power , '' according to the professor of iranian studies ronald e however , by the early 11th century the region fell to the muslim turkic peoples of the kara-khanid khanate , which led to both the turkification of the region as well as its conversion from buddhism to islam although the ancient chinese had called khotan yutian ( 于闐 ) , another more native iranian name occasionally used was jusadanna ( 瞿薩旦那 ) , derived from indo-iranian gostan and gostana , the names of the town and region around it , respectively much like the neighboring people of the kingdom of khotan , people of kashgar , the capital of

its later history , kashgar was controlled by various empires , including tang china , '' the territory of yārkand is for the first time mentioned in the hanshu ( 1st century bce ) , under the name shache ( old chinese , approximately , s³a ( j ) -ka ) , which is probably related to the name of the iranian saka tribes in the 11th century , according to mahmud al-kashgari , some non-turkic languages like the kanchaki and sogdian were still used in some areas in the vicinity of kashgar , and kanchaki is thought to belong to the saka language group in the 1st century bc , the greek-roman geographer strabo gave an extensive description of the peoples of the eastern steppe , whom he located in central asia beyond bactria and sogdiana strabo went on to list the names of the various tribes he believed to be '' scythian '' , and in so doing almost certainly conflated them with unrelated tribes of eastern central asia modern scholarly consensus is that the eastern iranian language ancestral to the pamir languages in central asia and the medieval saka language of xinjiang , was one of the scythian languages evidence of the middle iranian '' scytho-khotanese '' language survives in northwest china , where khotanese-saka-language documents , ranging from medical texts to buddhist texts , have been found primarily in khotan and tumxuk ( northeast of kashgar ) according to the indo-europeanist martin kümmel , wakhi may be classified as a western saka dialect ; the other attested saka dialects , khotanese and tumshuqese , would then be classified as eastern saka conclusions are ( i ) an early , bronze age mixing of both west and east eurasian lineages , with western lineages being found far to the east , but not vice versa ; ( ii ) an apparent reversal by iron age times , with an increasing presence of east eurasian lineages in the western steppe ; ( iii ) the possible role of migrations from the south , the balkano-danubian and iranian regions , toward the steppe they studied the haplotypes and haplogroups of 26 ancient human specimens from the krasnoyarsk area in siberia dated from between the middle of the 2nd millennium bc and the 4th century ad ( scythian and sarmatian timeframe ) 900 bc to ad 1 , compromising eight sakas of southern siberia ( tagar culture ) , eight sakas of the central steppe ( tasmola culture ) , and twelve sakas of the tian shan the study suggested that the saka were the source of west eurasian ancestry among the xiongnu , and that the huns probably emerged through conquests of sakas by the xiongnu , which is characterized by increased levels of east asian paternal ancestry in central asia a site found in 1968 in tillia tepe ( literally '' the golden hill '' ) in northern afghanistan ( former bactria ) near shebergan consisted of the graves of five women and one man with extremely rich jewelry , dated to around the 1st century bc , and probably related to that of saka tribes normally living slightly to the north hellenistic cultural and artistic influences appear in many of the forms and human depictions ( from putto to rings with the depiction of athena and her name inscribed in greek ) , attributable to the existence of the seleucid empire and greco-bactrian kingdom in the same area until around 140 bc , and the continued existence of the indo-greek kingdom in the northwestern indian sub-continent until the beginning of our era the art of the saka was of a similar styles as other iranian peoples of the steppes , which is referred to collectively as scythian art mallory and mair , the tarim mummies :
