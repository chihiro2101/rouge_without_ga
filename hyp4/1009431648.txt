stokowski conducted a great deal of contemporary music with the nbc symphony , including the us premiere of prokofiev 's alexander nevsky in 1943 , the world premieres of schoenberg 's piano concerto ( with eduard steuermann ) and george antheil 's 4th symphony , both in 1944 , and new works by alan hovhaness , stravinsky , hindemith , milhaud , howard hanson , william schuman , morton gould and many others fantasia ( 1940 walt disney animated movie ) , which stars stokowski leading the philadelphia orchestra and performing , among other pieces of music , his transcription of bach 's toccata and fugue in d minor , bwv 565 , as the opening piece of the program list of poles music long-haired hare ( 1949 bugs bunny cartoon ) , which pokes gentle fun at stokowski 's conducting style , including his habit of leading the orchestra without a baton he added works by rachmaninoff to his repertoire , giving the world premieres of his fourth piano concerto , the three russian songs , the third symphony , and the rhapsody on a theme of paganini ; sibelius , whose last three symphonies were given their american premieres in philadelphia in the 1920s ; and igor stravinsky , many of whose works were also given their first american performances by stokowski a lifelong and ardent fan of the newest and most experimental techniques in recording , stokowski saw to it that most of the music for fantasia was recorded over class a telephone lines laid down between the academy of music in philadelphia and bell laboratories in camden nj , using an early , highly complex version of multi-track stereophonic sound , dubbed fantasound , which shared many attributes with the later perspecta stereophonic sound system after the nbc symphony orchestra was disbanded as the official ensemble of the nbc radio network , it was re-formed as the symphony of the air with stokowski as notional music director , and as such performed many concerts and made recordings from 1954 until 1963

of thomas tallis , ravel 's rapsodie espagnole and brahms 's 4th symphony in 1960 , stokowski made one of his infrequent appearances in the opera house , when he conducted giacomo puccini 's turandot

danish radio orchestra on vai ( video artists international ) ; and charles ives ' 4th symphony with the american symphony orchestra on classical video rarities it has been suggested that stokowski resigned abruptly at cincinnati with the hidden knowledge that the conducting position in philadelphia was his when he wanted it , or as oscar levant suggested in his book a smattering of ignorance , '' he had the contract in his back pocket his early recordings were made at victor 's trinity church studio in camden , new jersey until 1926 , when victor began recording the orchestra in the academy

cbs also recorded he was very popular among the parishioners , who included members of the vanderbilt family , but in the course of time , he resigned this position in order to pursue a career as an

and on 14 june 1912 he conducted an all-wagner concert that featured the noted soprano lillian nordica 1-3 ( new york : da capo press , 1979 ) the '' mystery '' surrounding his origins and accent is clarified in oliver daniel 's 1000-page biography stokowski – a counterpoint of view ( 1982 ) , in which ( in chapter 12 ) daniel reveals stokowski came under the influence of his first wife , american pianist olga samaroff claxton , the registrar at the general office , somerset house , london , in the parish of all souls , county of middlesex ) gives his birth on 18 april 1882 , at 13 upper marylebone street ( now new cavendish street ) , in the marylebone district of london he encouraged '' free bowing '' from the string section , '' free breathing '' from the brass section , and continually altered the seating arrangements of the orchestra 's sections , as well as the acoustics of the hall , in response to his urge to create a better sound he conducted all the music ( with the exception of a '' jam session '' in the middle of the film ) and included his own orchestrations for the toccata and fugue in d minor and night on bald mountain/ave maria segments the lps were

cabinet-maker of poland heritage , kopernik joseph boleslaw stokowski , and his northampton-born wife annie-marion ( née moore ) , stokowski was born leopold anthony stokowski , although on occasion in later life he altered his middle name to antoni , per the polish spelling for example , stokowski revised the ending of the romeo and juliet ( tchaikovsky ) , by tchaikovsky , so it would close quietly , taking his notion from modest tchaikovsky 's life and letters of peter ilych tchaikovsky ( translated by rosa newmarch : 1906 ) that the composer had provided a quiet ending of his own at balakirev 's suggestion stokowski also became known for modifying the orchestrations of some of the works that he conducted , as was a standard practice for conductors prior to the second half of the 20th century he also experimented with new lighting arrangements in the concert hall , at one point conducting in a dark hall with only his head and hands lighted , at other times arranging the lights so they would cast theatrical shadows of his head and hands
