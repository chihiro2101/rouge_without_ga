although koreans had to learn classical chinese to be properly literate for the most part , some additional systems were developed which used simplified forms of chinese characters that phonetically transcribe korean , including hyangchal , gugyeol , and idu this is a typical example of gugyeol words where the radical is read in korean for its meaning ( hă— '' to do '' ) , whereas the suffix , ni ( meaning '' nun '' ) , is used phonetically since june 1949 , hanja have not officially been used in north korea , and , in addition , most texts are now most commonly written horizontally instead of vertically nevertheless , a large number of chinese-borrowed words are still widely used in the north ( although written in hangul ) , and hanja still appear in special contexts , such as recent north korean dictionaries the vast majority of hanja use the additional elements to indicate the sound of the character , but a few hanja are purely pictographic , and some were formed in other ways scholars in the 4th century used this to study and write confucian classics , which were written with these traditional characters as opposed to the not yet invented simplified characters to aid in understanding the meaning of a character , or to describe it orally to distinguish it from other characters with the same pronunciation , character dictionaries and school textbooks refer to each character with a combination of its sound and a word indicating its meaning '' a balance was struck in august 1976 , when the ministry of education agreed to keep chinese characters out of the elementary schools and teach the 1,800 characters in special courses , not as part of korean language or any other substantive curricula '' although north korea has removed chinese characters from its written materials , it has , paradoxically , ended up with an educational program that teachers more characters than either south korea or japan , as table 2 shows '' but by the 1960s , he had reversed his stance ; he was quoted as saying in 1966 , '' while we should use as few sinitic terms as possible , students must be exposed to the necessary chinese characters and taught how to write them hanja 's language of origin , chinese , has many homophones , and hanja words became even more homophonic when they came into korean , since korean lacks a tonal system , which is how chinese distinguishes many words that would otherwise be homophonic hanja are often also used as a form of shorthand in newspaper headlines , advertisements , and on signs , for example the banner at the funeral for the sailors lost in the sinking of roks cheonan this practice helps to eliminate ambiguity , and it also serves as a sort of shorthand etymology , since the meaning of the hanja and the fact that the word is composed of hanja often help to illustrate the word 's origin the most notable exception is the name of the capital , seoul , a native korean word meaning '' capital '' with no direct hanja conversion ; the hanja gyeong , '' capital '' ) is sometimes used as a back-rendering for example , disyllabic names of railway lines , freeways , and provinces are often formed by taking one character from each of the two locales ' names ; thus , the gyeongbu corridor connects seoul ( gyeong , and busan ( bu , ; the gyeongin corridor connects seoul and incheon ( in , ; the former jeolla province took its name from the first characters in the city names jeonju and naju ( '' naju '' is originally '' raju , '' but the initial '' r/l '' sound in south korean is simplified to '' n '' ) subway and railway station signs give the station 's name in hangul , hanja , and english , both to assist visitors ( including chinese or japanese who may rely on the hanja spellings ) and to disambiguate the name hanja are still required for certain disciplines in academia , such as oriental studies and other disciplines studying chinese , japanese or historic korean literature and culture , since the vast majority of primary source text material are written in hanzi , kanji , hanja , etc for the traditional creative arts such as calligraphy and painting , a knowledge of hanja is needed to write and understand the various scripts and inscriptions , as is the same in china and japan on 9 september 2003 , the celebration for the 55th anniversary of north korea appeared a float decorated with the situation of north korean people welcomes kim il-sung , which including a banner with kim il-sung 's name written with hanja in 1956 , one study found mixed-script korean text ( in which sino-korean nouns are written using hanja , and other words using hangul ) were read faster than texts written purely in hangul ; however , by 1977 , the situation had reversed they include ; dap ; '' paddy field '' ) , ; jang , '' wardrobe '' ) , ; dol , a character only used in given names ) , ; so , a rare surname from seongju ) , and ; gi , an old name referring to kumgangsan ) the pronunciation of hanja in korean is by no means identical to the way they are pronounced in modern chinese , particularly mandarin , although some chinese dialects and korean share similar pronunciations for some characters in other aspects , the pronunciation of hanja is more conservative than most northern and central chinese dialects , for example in the retention of labial consonant codas in characters with labial consonant onsets , such as the characters beop ) and beom ) ; labial codas existed in middle chinese but do not survive intact in most northern and central chinese varieties today , and even in many southern chinese varieties that still retain labial codas , including cantonese and hokkien , labial codas in characters with labial onsets are replaced by their dental counterparts when learning how to write hanja , students are taught to memorize the native korean pronunciation for the hanja 's meaning and the sino-korean pronunciations ( the pronunciation based on the chinese pronunciation of the characters ) for each hanja respectively so that students know what the syllable and meaning is for a particular hanja for example , the name for the hanja is ( mul-su ) in which ( mul ) is the native korean pronunciation for '' water '' , while ( su ) is the sino-korean pronunciation of the character other examples include ( saram-in ) for '' person/people '' , ( keul-dae ) for '' big/large/great '' , ( jageul-so ) for '' small/little '' , ( arae-ha ) for '' underneath/below/low '' , ( abi-bu ) for '' father '' , and ( naraireum-han ) for '' han/korea '' .
