in march 1941 wkbw inaugurated a new transmitter plant south of buffalo in the town of hamburg , increased power to 50,000 watts around the clock and shifted to its current dial position at 1520 & nbsp ; khz as a result of narba at night , it must direct its signal eastward due to sharing a frequency with kokc in oklahoma city , oklahoma ( the former koma , another flame-throwing 50,000-watt top 40 powerhouse in the 1960s and 1970s ) wkbw radio was sold to price communications , who subsequently changed the station 's call letters to the current wwkb on january 3 , mainly in order to keep the long-standing '' kb '' slogan ( which was necessitated due to an fcc regulation in effect then that forbade tv and radio stations in the same city , but with different owners from sharing the same call letters ; the former calls remained on now-former sister station wkbw-tv , which capital cities/abc would sell to queen city broadcasting ) the espn radio affiliation had previously been on wgr from the network 's launch in 1992 until 2013 ; wgr 's increased emphasis on local programming ( and , since the phil hendrie show moved to an earlier time slot , a lack of progressive talk programs to air in the overnight hours ) prompted entercom to move the espn affiliation to a full-time signal the station is primarily a straight simulcast of the espn radio feed , with the exception of the jim rome show which is part of cbs sports radio on july 4 , 1958 , a few months before companion station wkbw-tv ( channel 7 ) was launched , wkbw radio abandoned its adult approach and was converted into a personality-driven full service top 40 music radio station , featuring foreground personalities , a tight playlist of current hits and an aggressive local news department , which it continued to program with great success for over 20 years wkbw changed frequencies from 1380 to 1480 & nbsp ; khz in the late 1920s as a result of general order 40 ( bumping the station already at that frequency , wufo , down the dial to 1040 & nbsp ; khz ) , and raised its power to 5,000 wattsâ€”the first buffalo station to raise its power to that level buffalo bills home games buffalo bandits lacrosse ( in season ) buffalo bisons baseball ( in season ) buffalo bulls football and basketball ( beginning 2014 ) nfl on westwood one ( in season , overflow from wgr when wgr does bills games ) select buffalo sabres preseason and prospect tournament games wwkb 's 50,000-watt signal has made the station desirable as an outlet for the buffalo 's second-tier sports teams : the buffalo bandits have aired on the station since the 2006 season ( moving from wgr where it took the place of the locked-out sabres in 2005 ) , buffalo bulls football and basketball , and , on and off , the buffalo bisons , who moved back to the frequency in april 2008 nevertheless , entercom found the personality oldies format too expensive to maintain in buffalo for only a 2 share , and so on february 6 , 2006 , wwkb ended a three-year run as an oldies station with a format change to predominantly syndicated progressive talk during the 1930s , wkbw shared a cbs affiliation with then-sister station wgr , and in the 1940s , was affiliated with the nbc blue network and its corporate successor abc , running as a conventional full service network affiliated station also offering local news and music programming the oldies format was an attempt to recreate the station 's history as a popular music station ( and was part of a nationwide fad of '' real oldies '' formats on am radio stations in the early 2000s ) the local sports broadcasts and brokered programming that wwkb carried under its previous format continue under the espn affiliation ; the station launched with a broadcast of the buffalo sabres ' participation in the traverse city prospects tournament on halloween night 1968 , writer dan kriegler and then-program director jefferson kaye ( later the voice of wpvi-tv in philadelphia , co-owned with wkbw-tv in 1971 ) commemorated the 30th anniversary of orson welles ' 1938 war of the worlds by re-making the infamous broadcast , updating the storyline and changing locations to make it significant to buffalo listeners wwkb 's transmitter is located in hamburg , new york , with a three-tower array designed for maximum nighttime range while it maintained the official wwkb calls for station identification , it also played the original '' wkbw buffalo '' jingles and featured many of the classic wkbw jocks including armstrong and neaverth , who is currently on air at weck buffalo in 1999 , sinclair decided to divest its radio stations , selling most of them , including wwkb , wben and wgr , to entercom wkbw was founded in 1926 as a religious station , operating at the frequency of 1380 & nbsp ; khz with top 40 music every night , and the station actually had a better signal at night in the western boston suburbs than boston 's own top 40 station , wmex , located at 1510 , right next door to wkbw while not performing as well in arbitron ratings as it had in its golden past , the revived '' wkbw '' earned the best ratings for the station since the 1990s , with approximately a 2 share , and was beginning to grow i heard it on the am radio-wkbw heard in morocco-1967 audio file of wkbw playing '' sleepy jean '' / '' daydream believer '' -1967 wwkb 's daytime signal decently covers all of western new york , including rochester , as well as the southern tier
