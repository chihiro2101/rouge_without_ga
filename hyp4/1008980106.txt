before an architectural competition was launched in november 1831 this attracted 46 entrants , and in march 1832 the premium was awarded , despite some opposition , for a gothic revival design by henry edward kendall ; this decision was , however , eventually overturned on 11 july 1832 , the act of parliament establishing a '' general cemetery company for the interment of the dead in the

kensal green has always been more expensive and prestigious than burial in a simple plot in the grounds of the cemetery , although less costly than a brick-lined grave or mausoleum without the further expense and responsibility of a monument above the grave , the catacombs have afforded a secure , dignified and exclusive resting place for the well-to-do , particularly the unmarried , the childless and young children of those without family plots or mausolea elsewhere the cemetery contains the graves of 473 commonwealth service personnel of the first world war & nbsp ; – half of whom form a war
