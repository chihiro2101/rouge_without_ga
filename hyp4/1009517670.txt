there had been debate over whether to classify this species as lynx rufus or felis rufus as part of a wider issue regarding whether the four species of lynx should be given their own genus , or be placed as a subgenus of felis the bobcat is believed to have evolved from the eurasian lynx , which crossed into north america by way of the bering land bridge during the pleistocene , with progenitors arriving as early as 2.6 million years ago texensis ( mearns ) – western louisiana , texas , south-central oklahoma , and south into tamaulipas , nuevo león , and coahuila this subspecies division has been challenged , given a lack of clear geographic breaks in their ranges and the minor differences between these subspecies the latest revision of cat taxonomy in 2017 , by the cat classification taskforce of the cat specialist group recognises only two subspecies , based on phylogeographic and genetic studies , although the status of the mexican bobcat ( lynx rufus esquinapae syn lynx rufus oaxacensis ) remains under review : lynx rufus rufus – east of the great plains , north america lynx rufus fasciatus – west of the great plains , north america its coat is variable , though generally tan to grayish-brown , with black streaks on the body and dark bars on the forelegs and tail the nose of the bobcat is pinkish-red , and it has a base color of gray or yellowish- or brownish-red on its face , sides , and back youtube ( august 3 , 2015 ) the adult bobcat is long from the head to the base of its distinctive stubby tail , averaging ; the tail , which appears '' bobbed '' and gives the species its name , adds an adult stands about at the shoulders a morphological size comparison study in the eastern united states found a divergence in the location of the largest male and female specimens , suggesting differing natural selection for the sexes this behavior may vary seasonally , as bobcats become more diurnal during fall and winter in response to the activity of their prey , which are more active during the day in colder weather in its territory , the bobcat has numerous places of shelter , usually a main den , and several auxiliary shelters on the outer extent of its range , such as hollow logs , brush piles , thickets , or under rock ledges another found that female bobcats , especially those which were reproductively active , expanded their home range in winter , but that males merely shifted their range without expanding it , which was consistent with numerous earlier studies its main prey varies by region : in the eastern united states , it is the eastern cottontail and new england cottontail , and in the north , it is the snowshoe hare with small animals , such as rodents ( including squirrels , moles , muskrats , mice ) , birds , fish including small sharks , bobcat drags shark out of florida surf and insects , it hunts in areas known to be abundant in prey , and will lie , crouch , or stand , and wait for victims to wander close for slightly larger animals , such as geese , ducks , rabbits , and hares , it stalks from cover and waits until prey comes within before rushing in to attack less commonly , it feeds on larger animals , such as young ungulates , and other carnivores , such as fishers ( primarily female ) , foxes , minks , martens , skunks , raccoons , small dogs , and domesticated cats while larger species , such as cattle , and horses , are not known to be attacked , bobcats do present a threat to smaller ruminants , such as pigs , sheep and goats however , some amount of bobcat predation may be misidentified , as bobcats have been known to scavenge on the remains of livestock kills by other animals it has been known to kill deer or pronghorn , and sometimes to hunt elk in western north america , especially in winter when smaller prey is scarce , or when deer populations become more abundant one study in the everglades showed a large majority of kills ( 33 of 39 ) were fawns , according to the yellowstone showed a large amount of kills ( 15 of 20 ) were includes elk calves , but prey up to eight times the bobcat 's weight could be successfully taken it stalks the deer , often when the deer is lying down , then rushes in and grabs it by the neck before biting the throat , base of the skull , or chest on the rare occasions a bobcat kills a deer , it eats its fill and then buries the carcass under snow or leaves , often returning to it several times to feed however , other studies have found bobcat populations may decrease in areas with high coyote populations , with the more social inclination of the canid giving them a possible competitive advantage with the canada lynx , however , the interspecific competition affects distribution patterns ; competitive exclusion by the bobcat is likely to have prevented any further southward expansion of the range of its felid relative a dominant male travels with a female and mates with her several times , generally from winter until early spring ; this varies by location , but most mating takes place during february and march kittens may be taken by several predators , including owls ( almost entirely great horned owls ) , eagles , foxes , and bears , as well as other adult male bobcats ; when prey populations are not abundant , fewer kittens are likely to reach adulthood the bobcat may have external parasites , mostly ticks and fleas , and often carries the parasites of its prey , especially those of rabbits and squirrels parasites ' and diseases ' role in the mortality of the bobcat is still unclear , but they may account for greater mortality than starvation , accidents , and predation the population of the bobcat depends primarily on the population of its prey ; other principal factors in the selection of habitat type include protection from severe weather , availability of resting and den sites , dense cover for hunting and escape , and freedom from disturbance the bobcat 's range does not seem to be limited by human populations , but by availability of suitable habitat ; only large , intensively cultivated tracts are unsuitable for the species the historical range of the bobcat was from southern canada , throughout the united states , and as far south as the mexican state of oaxaca , and it still persists across much of this area in the 20th century , it was thought to have lost territory in the us midwest and parts of the northeast , including southern minnesota , eastern south dakota , and much of missouri , mostly due to habitat changes from modern agricultural practices while thought to no longer exist in western new york and pennsylvania , multiple confirmed sightings of bobcats ( including dead specimens ) have been recently reported in new york 's southern tier and in central new york , and a bobcat was captured in 2018 on a tourist boat in downtown pittsburgh , pennsylvania the bobcat does not tolerate deep snow , and waits out heavy storms in sheltered areas ; it lacks the large , padded feet of the canadian lynx and can not support its weight on snow as efficiently the bobcat is not entirely at a disadvantage where its range meets that of the larger felid : displacement of the canadian lynx by the aggressive bobcat has been observed where they interact in nova scotia , while the clearing of coniferous forests for agriculture has led to a northward retreat of the canadian lynx 's range to the advantage of the bobcat in northern and central mexico , the cat is found in dry scrubland and forests of pine and oak ; its range ends at the tropical southern portion of the country it is listed in appendix ii of the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora ( cites ) , which means it is not considered threatened with extinction , but hunting and trading must be closely monitored the animal is regulated in all three of its range countries , and is found in a number of protected areas of the united states , its principal territory estimates from the us fish and wildlife service placed bobcat numbers between 700,000 and 1,500,000 in the us in 1988 , with increased range and population density suggesting even greater numbers in subsequent years ; for these reasons , the u.s it is listed as least concern on the iucn red list , noting it is relatively widespread and abundant , but information from southern mexico is poor the bobcat also suffered population decline in new jersey at the turn of the 19th century , mainly because of commercial and agricultural developments causing habitat fragmentation ; by 1972 , the bobcat was given full legal protection , and was listed as endangered in the state in 1991 the bobcat has long been valued both for fur and sport ; it has been hunted and trapped by humans , but has maintained a high population , even in the southern united states , where it is extensively hunted in the 1970s and 1980s , an unprecedented rise in price for bobcat fur caused further interest in hunting , but by the early 1990s , prices had dropped significantly in bobcats using urban habitats in california , the use of rodenticides has been linked to both secondary poisoning by consuming poisoned rats and mice , and to increased rates of severe mite infestation ( known as notoedric mange ) , as an animal with a poison-weakened immune system is less capable of fighting off mange stories featuring the bobcat , in many variations , are found in some indigenous cultures of north america , with parallels in south america after trapping the rabbit in a tree , the bobcat is persuaded to build a fire , only to have the embers scattered on its fur , leaving it singed with dark brown spots european colonizers to the americas also admired the cat , both for its ferocity and its grace , and in the united states , it '' rests prominently in the anthology of & nbsp ; '' grave artifacts from dirt domes excavated in the 1980s along the illinois river revealed a complete skeleton of a young bobcat along with a collar made of bone pendants and shell beads that had been buried by the hopewell culture the hopewell normally buried their dogs , so the bones were initially identified as remains of a puppy , but dogs were usually buried close to the village and not in the mounds themselves
