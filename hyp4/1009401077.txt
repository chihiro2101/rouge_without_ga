the legal standing is similar to that in england and wales , in that cpr is viewed as a treatment and , although there is a general presumption that cpr will be performed in the case of cardiac arrest , this is not the case if it is viewed by the treating clinician to be futile in the united states , cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( cpr ) and advanced cardiac life support ( acls ) will not be performed if a valid written dnr order is present if a patient has a living will that specifies the patient requests dnr but does not have a properly filled out state-sponsored form that is co-signed by a physician , ems may attempt resuscitation interviews with 26 dnr patients and 16 full code patients in toronto in 2006-9 suggest that the decision to choose do-not-resuscitate status was based on personal factors including health and lifestyle ; relational factors ( to family or to society as a whole ) ; and philosophical factors in 1995 , the canadian medical association , canadian hospital association , canadian nursing association , and catholic health association of canada worked with the canadian bar association to clarify and create a joint statement on resuscitative interventions guideline for use to determine when and how dnr orders are assigned patients and families can not demand cpr to be performed if it is felt to be futile ( as with any medical treatment ) and a dnacpr can be issued despite disagreement , although it is good practice to involve all parties in the discussion patients and relatives can not demand treatment ( including cpr ) which the doctor believes is futile and in this situation , it is their doctor 's duty to act in their 'best interest ' , whether that means continuing or discontinuing treatment , using their clinical judgment with the dat it is also possible to appoint a trustee , as long as he is of age and capable of understanding and willing , who is called to represent the signatory of the dat who has become incapable in relations with the doctor and health facilities also included in the hospice and palliative regulation is the requirement to inform a patient of their terminal condition , however , the requirement is not explicitly defined leading to interpretation of exact truth telling after cpr , up to 1 more person , among each 100 survivors , is in a coma than before cpr ( and most people come out of comas ) if the patient is unable to make a decision , the discussion , thus , goes to a trusted third party in israel , it is possible to sign a dnr form as long as the patient is dying and aware of their actions patients may also specify their wishes and/or devolve their decision-making to a proxy using an advance directive , which are commonly referred to as 'living wills ' , or an emergency care and treatment plan ( ectp ) , such as respect '' cpr revives 64 % of patients in hospitals and 43 % outside ( rosc ) , which gives families a chance to say goodbye , and all organs can be considered for donation , '' we recommend that all patients who are resuscitated from cardiac arrest but who subsequently progress to death or brain death be evaluated for organ donation the uae have laws forcing healthcare staff to resuscitate a patient even if the patient has a dnr or does not wish to live typically , the time period between signing the dnr and death is very short , showing that signing a dnr in taiwan is typically delayed an advanced care directive legally defines the medical treatments that a person may choose to receive ( or not to receive ) in various defined circumstances evaluation of respect ( an ectp ) found that resuscitation status remained a central component of conversations , and that there was variability in the discussion of other emergency treatments in nsw , a resuscitation plan is a medically authorised order to use or withhold resuscitation measures , and which documents other aspects of treatment relevant at end of life research shows that cpr survival is the same as the average cpr survival rate , or nearly so , for patients with multiple chronic illnesses , or diabetes , heart or lung diseases the ranges given in the text above represent outcomes inside and outside of hospitals : in us hospitals a study of 12,500 survivors after cpr , 2000-2009 , found : 1 % more survivors of cpr were in comas than before cpr ( 3 % before , 4 % after ) , 5 % more survivors were dependent on other people , and 5 % more had moderate mental problems but were still independent
