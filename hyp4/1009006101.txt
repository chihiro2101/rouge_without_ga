historically , prefixes for civilian vessels often identified the vessel 's mode of propulsion , such as , '' ss '' ( screw steamer ) , '' mv '' ( motor vessel ) , or '' ps '' ( paddle steamer ) in terms of abbreviations that may reflect a vessel 's purpose or function , technology has introduced a broad variety of differently named vessels onto the world 's oceans , such as ; '' lpgc '' ( liquified petroleum gas carrier ) , or '' tb '' ( tug-boat ) , or '' db '' ( derrick barge ) historically , the most significant navy was britain 's royal navy , which has usually used the prefix '' hms '' , standing for '' his/her majesty 's ship '' in the early days of the united states navy , abbreviations often included the type of vessel , for instance '' usf '' ( united states frigate ) , but this method was abandoned by president theodore roosevelt 's executive order no in the united states navy that prefix officially only applies while the ship is in active commission , with only the name used before or after a period of commission and for all vessels '' in service '' rather than commissioned status however , not all navies used prefixes ; this includes the significant navies of china , france and russia bureau of fisheries in 1903 , and usfs in turn was replaced in 1940 by us fws when the bureau of fisheries merged with the united states department of the interior 's division of biological survey to form the department of the interior 's fish and wildlife service ( which in 1956 was reorganized as the united states fish and wildlife service ) vessels , such as yard and harbor craft that are not commissioned and '' in service '' are officially referred to by name or hull number without prefix prior to commissioning , ships may be described as a pre-commissioning unit or pcu ; for example , the uncommissioned has been described as the '' pre-commissioning unit ( pcu ) gerald r when it is stricken from the fleet list , a ship typically has the prefix '' ex- '' added to its name , to distinguish it from any active ships bearing the same name and '' msv '' for '' merchant space vehicle '' , used on numerous human commercial ships , as well as '' pfs '' for a turian hierarchy naval craft , and a freighter aml demeter of unknown affiliation dead space – '' usg '' , standing for '' united spacefaring guild '' , which oversees civilian spacecraft operation , including the planet-cracker class leader usg ishimura of the concordance extraction corporation ; '' usm '' for the earth defense force of earthgov ; and '' cms '' for its former opponents , the sovereign colonies armed forces the lost fleet – the alliance use the prefix '' asn '' for '' allied systems navy '' ( or possibly '' alliance of systems navy '' ) , the syndicate worlds do not use prefixes '' honorverse '' – the manticoran kingdom uses '' hms '' as a prefix , the graysons use '' gns '' ( grayson navy ship ) , and the havenite ships use '' pns '' ( people 's navy ship ) and later '' rhns '' ( republic of haven navy ship ) , being reflections of actual ship prefixing traditions , and mirroring the napoleonic wars the culture – ships are identified by a three-letter prefix denoting class ( such as gsv for '' general systems vehicle '' or rou for '' rapid offensive unit '' ) , followed by their personal name unreal tournament – ships mentioned there have prefixes such as itv ( '' interstellar transport vessel '' , the first non-tutorial match in the tournament happens on board of itv oblivion ) and isv ( '' interstellar science vessel '' , ship 's name being isv-kran from unreal ) neither the holy dominion nor the league of tripoli use prefixes , although the kms hessen is mentioned once , it is n't clear if the prefix is internally used or not
