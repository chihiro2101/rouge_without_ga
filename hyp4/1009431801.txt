pinero travelled to new york for the american premiere , at daly 's theatre in october 1885 57–58 his first full-length play , la comète , was staged in a theatre in croydon in 1878 , and he wrote four more one-act comedies , staged in london in 1878–1880 , playing in two of them – daisy 's escape and bygones – at the lyceum pinero 's profile as a playwright was further raised by the money spinner , a full-length comedy , first given at the prince 's theatre , manchester in november 1880 and then at the st james 's in london in january 1881 323–331 pinero 's other court farces – the schoolmistress ( 1886 ) , dandy dick ( 1887 ) , the cabinet minister ( 1890 ) and the amazons ( 1893 ) – ran for 291 , 262 , 199 and 114 performances respectively , an aggregate of 866 his shakespearean roles were lord stanley in richard iii ( 1877 ) , rosencrantz in hamlet ( 1878 ) , guildenstern in hamlet ( 1879 ) , salarino in the merchant of venice ( 1879 ) , and roderigo in othello ( 1881 ) 155 reviewing the book , the academic robert ronning agreed that the farces were pinero 's most enduring works : : the fact that students will continue to read the second mrs tanqueray instead of the magistrate does not mean much except for what they learn about craftsmanship , and this could be learned equally well from the farces in a 1972 study of the playwright , walter lazenby wrote , '' pinero can not be outranked as a farceur by any other english writer ; not even shakespeare consistently expended on this form the care and art which went into the court theatre farces or achieved such thoroughly satisfying results '' it is not clear why carte chose to commission a libretto from two writers with no experience in the genre , but for arthur sullivan 's the beauty stone he brought together pinero and j the first of pinero 's works to be filmed was the second mrs tanqueray , in an unauthorised american silent version in 1914 , which prompted a successful but not very lucrative lawsuit by the author 742 during this period he became particularly associated with the court theatre , where five of his farces were presented , with great success at the box office , between 1885 and 1892 , beginning with the magistrate pinero or a more delicate subtlety , a third may easily outclass him in intellectual gymnastic , but in his command of the resources of the stage for the legitimate purposes of the stage he is without a rival the play shows a popular actress in mid-victorian melodramas marrying into the aristocracy , regretting it , returning to the stage and finding that she can no longer make the old style of plays work , successfully switching to works in the new realistic style pinero was born in london , the only son , and second of three children , of john daniel pinero ( 1798–1871 ) , and his wife lucy , née daines ( 1836–1905 ) with the exception of two adaptations of serious french works , the ironmaster ( 1884 ) and mayfair ( 1885 ) , pinero 's output between 1884 and 1893 consisted of six farces and five comedies the notorious mrs ebbsmith ( 1895 ) managed a run of 88 performances , the benefit of the doubt ( 1895 ) ran for 74 , the thunderbolt ( 1908 ) and mid-channel ( 1909 ) both ran for 58 pinero 's play was regarded as daringly unconventional and a risky venture , but it caught on with the public , particularly for the character baron croodle , a '' disreputable but delightful old reprobate and card-shark '' played by john hare although the tour was uncongenial , and pinero gathered some highly critical notices , he continued to work as a supporting actor to irving for five years while he was planning it , several plays of henrik ibsen were presented in london for the first time , regarded by much of polite society as avant garde , blunt and shocking as it was said of euripides that he was τραγικώτατος , the most tragic of the tragic writers , as it might be said of molière that he was the most comic of comic writers , so it may be said of mr
