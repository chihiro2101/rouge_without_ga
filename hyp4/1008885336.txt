in the united states ansi c84.1 : american national standard for electric power systems and equipment – voltage ratings ( 60 hertz ) , nema ( costs 95 for access ) and canada , csa can3-c235-83 : preferred voltage levels for ac systems , 0 to 50 & thinsp ; 000 & nbsp ; v national standards specify that the nominal voltage at the source should be 120 & nbsp ; v and allow a range of 114 & nbsp ; v to 126 & nbsp ; v ( rms ) ( −5 % to +5 % ) the significant exceptions are in brazil , which has a synchronized 60 & nbsp ; hz grid with both 127 & nbsp ; v and 220 & nbsp ; v as standard voltages in different regions , and japan , which has two frequencies : 50 & nbsp ; hz for east japan and 60 & nbsp ; hz for west japan many other combinations of voltage and utility frequency were formerly used , with frequencies between 25 & nbsp ; hz and 133 & nbsp ; hz and voltages from 100 & nbsp ; v to 250 & nbsp ; v cenelec harmonisation document hd 472 s1:1988 british standard bs 7697 : nominal voltages for low voltage public electricity supply systems – ( implementation of hd 472 s1 ) no change in voltage was required by either the central european or the uk system , as both 220 & thinsp ; v and 240 & thinsp ; v fall within the lower 230 & nbsp ; v tolerance bands ( 230 & nbsp ; v ±6 % ) eastern and northern parts of honshū ( including tokyo ) and hokkaidō have a frequency of 50 & nbsp ; hz , whereas western honshū ( including nagoya , osaka , and hiroshima ) , shikoku , kyūshū and okinawa operate at 60 & nbsp ; hz in the us , mains electric power is referred to by several names including '' utility power '' , '' household power '' , '' household electricity '' , '' house current '' , '' powerline '' , '' domestic power '' , '' wall power '' , '' line power '' , '' ac power '' , '' city power '' , '' street power '' the modern combinations of 230 & nbsp ; v/50 & nbsp ; hz and 120 & nbsp ; v/60 & nbsp ; hz , listed in iec 60038 , did not apply in the first few decades of the 20th century and are still not universal around 1893 the westinghouse electric company in the united states and aeg in germany decided to standardize their generation equipment on 60 & nbsp ; hz and 50 & nbsp ; hz respectively , eventually leading to most of the world being supplied at one of these two frequencies for a list of voltages , frequencies , and wall plugs by country , see mains electricity by country worldwide , many different mains power systems are found for the operation of household and light commercial electrical appliances and lighting today most 60 & nbsp ; hz systems deliver nominal 120/240 & nbsp ; v , and most 50 & nbsp ; hz nominally 230 & nbsp ; v it was an alternating current ( ac ) system using a siemens alternator supplying power for both street lights and consumers at two voltages , 250 & nbsp ; v for arc lamps , and 40 & nbsp ; v for incandescent lamps power quality can also be affected by distortions of the current or voltage waveform in the form of harmonics of the fundamental ( supply ) frequency , or non-harmonic intermodulation such as that caused by rfi or emi interference historically 110 & nbsp ; v , 115 & nbsp ; v and 117 & nbsp ; v have been used at different times and places in north america by connecting two groups of 110 & nbsp ; v lamps in series more load could be served by the same size conductors run with 220 & nbsp ; v between them ; a neutral conductor carried any imbalance of current between the two sub-circuits 193 in the first decade after the introduction of alternating current in the us ( from the early 1880s to about 1893 ) a variety of different frequencies were used , with each electric provider setting their own , so that no single one prevailed
