the burning of books has a long history as a tool that has been wielded by authorities both secular and religion , in their efforts to suppress dissenting or heresy views that are believed to pose a threat to the prevailing order according to the tanakh ( hebrew bible ) , in the 7th century bce king jehoiakim of judah burned part of a scroll that baruch ben neriah had written at prophet jeremiah 's dictation ( jeremiah 36 ) in 213 bce qin shi huang , the first emperor of the qin dynasty , ordered the burning of books and burying of scholars and in 210 bce he supposedly ordered the live burial of 460 confucian scholars in order to stay on his throne though the burning of books is well established , the live burial of scholars has been disputed by modern historians who doubt the details of the story , which first appeared more than a century later in the han dynasty official sima qian 's records of the grand historian after the first council of nicea ( 325 ce ) , roman emperor constantine the great issued an edict against nontrinitarian arians which included a prescription for systematic book-burning : '' in addition , if any writing composed by arius should be found , it should be handed over to the flames , so that not only will the wickedness of his teaching be obliterated , but nothing will be left even to remind anyone of him and i hereby make a public order , that if someone should be discovered to have hidden a writing composed by arius , and not to have immediately brought it forward and destroyed it by fire , his penalty shall be death elaine pagels , beyond belief : the secret gospel of thomas ( random house , 2003 ) , page 176-177 ( pagels cites athanasius 's paschal letter ( letter 39 ) for 367 ce , which prescribes a canon , but her citation '' cleanse the church from every defilement '' ( page 177 ) does not explicitly appear in the festal letter 'the writings of nestorius were originally very numerous ' , however , they were not part of the nestorian or oriental theological curriculum until the mid-sixth century , unlike those of his teacher theodore of mopsuestia , and those of diodorus of tarsus , even then they were not key texts , so relatively few survive intact , cf according to the chronicle of fredegar , recared , visigothic kingdom ( reigned 586–601 ) and first catholic king of spain , following his conversion to catholicism in 587 , ordered that all arian books should be collected and burned ; and all the books of arian theology were reduced to ashes , along with the house in which they had been purposely collected in 1244 , as an outcome of the disputation of paris , twenty-four carriage loads of talmuds and other jewish religious manuscripts were set on fire by french law officers in the streets of paris de landa wrote : '' we found a large number of books in these characters and , as they contained nothing in which were not to be seen as superstition and lies of the devil , we burned them all , which they ( the maya ) regretted to an amazing degree , and which caused them much affliction '' ironically , most of the books that were destroyed by the europeans were biased and based upon the aztec people 's version of the history of the region the schism between the church of england and that of the roman catholic church reached a tipping point during the tudor and stuart periods of england ( 1485–1603 , 1603–1714 ) , when the citizens loyal to crown and country sacked abbeys and monasteries across the british countryside , and pillaged their valuable books to burn , degrade , or destroy david cressy 's ( 2005 ) article , book burning in tudor and stuart england discussed the mechanics of these book burnings and how the enforcement was trickled down to the citizens ; that everyone had a part in this '' spectacle '' '' over the course of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries book burning developed from a rare to an occasional occurrence , relocated from an outdoor to an indoor procedure , and changed from a bureaucratic to a quasi-theatrical performance '' comstock 's total accomplishment in a long and influential career is estimated to have been the destruction of some 15 & nbsp ; tons of books , 284,000 & nbsp ; pounds of plates for printing such '' objectionable '' books , and nearly 4,000,000 pictures to this day , his followers mourn '' the burned book '' and seek in their rabbi 's surviving writings for clues as to what the lost volume contained and why it was destroyed as noted in claire tomalin 's intensively researched '' the invisible woman '' , charles dickens is known to have made a big bonfire of his letters and private papers , as well as asking friends and acquaintances to either return letters which he wrote to them or themselves destroy the letters – and most complied with his request martin gardner , a well-known expert on the work of lewis carroll , believes that carroll had written a earlier version of alice in wonderland which he later destroyed after writing a more elaborate version which he presented to the child alice who inspired the book however , no such symphony was ever performed , and the only concrete evidence of the symphony 's existence on paper is a 1933 bill for a fair copy of the first movement and short draft fragments first published and played in 2011 during the revolutions of 1848 in the austrian empire the imperial court library ( now austrian national library ) was in extreme danger , when the bombardment of vienna caused the burning of the hofburg , in which the imperial library was located otherwise the archives – containing a vast number of documents relating to the 1500-years ' history of the abbey as well as some 1,400 irreplaceable manuscript codex , chiefly patristic and historical – would have been destroyed in the allied air bombing which almost completely destroyed the abbey shortly afterwards also saved by the two officers ' prompt action were the collections of the keats-shelley memorial house in rome , which had been sent to the abbey for safety in december 1942 the sarajevo haggadah – one of the oldest and most valuable jewish illustrated manuscripts , with immense historical and cultural value – was hidden from the nazis and their ustaše collaborators by derviš korkut , chief librarian of the national museum in sarajevo at risk to his own life , korkut smuggled the haggadah out of sarajevo and gave it for safekeeping to a muslim cleric in zenica , where it was hidden until the end of the war under the floorboards of either a mosque or a muslim home this library contained copies of titles that were burned by the nazis in their campaign to cleanse german culture of jewish and foreign influences such as pacifist and decadent literature the herculaneum papyri are more than 1,800 papyri found in the herculaneum villa of the papyri , in the 18th century , carbonized by the eruption of mount vesuvius in 79 , very fragile , but with great care they can be unrolled and read in the way of diaries , manuscripts , letters ( my own and others ' ) , sketches , and so on , is to be burned unread despite the fact that the act of destroying books is condemned by the majority of the world 's societies , book burning still occurs on a small or large scale in the people 's republic of china , library officials publicize the burning of books that have fallen out of favor with the communist party of china 's elites book burnings were regularly organised in nazi germany in the 1930s by stormtroopers so that '' degenerate '' works could be destroyed , especially works written by jewish authors such as thomas mann , marcel proust , and karl marx seeking to '' cleanse '' german culture of the '' un-german '' spirit , goebbels compelled students ( who were egged on by their professors ) to perform the book burning to some this could be easily dismissed as the childish actions of the youth , but to many in europe and america , it was a horrific display of power and disrespect the student , barbro andenaes , reported the actions of the senior official to the superintendent of the reading room and then reported them to the head librarian of the university library in oslo while this may not have been the large scale , violent demonstration which usually occurs during wars , kvavik 's disregard for libraries and books shows that the destruction of books on any scale can affect an entire country here , a senior official in the norwegian government was disgraced and the university library was only refunded for a small portion of the costs which it had incurred from the loss and destruction of rare materials and the security changes that had to be made as a result of it in this case , the lure of personal profit and the desire to enhance one 's own collection were the causes of the defacement of rare books and maps staff members fished books from the water in hopes of salvaging the rare editions of travel books , documents about the boer wars , and contemporary materials which were both for and against apartheid the world was outraged by the loss of knowledge that these demonstrators had caused , and instead of supporting their cause and drawing people 's attention to the issue of apartheid , the international community denounced their actions at amsterdam 's south african institute such is the case with the burning of heretical books over a side door on the façade of santa maria maggiore , rome , the bas-relief by giovanni battista maini , which depicts the burning of '' heretical '' books as a triumph of righteousness during the years of the chilean military dictatorship under augusto pinochet ( 1973–1990 ) , book burnings in chile as a way of repression and censorship of left-wing literature in 1981 , the jaffna public library in jaffna , sri lanka , was burned down by sinhalese police and paramilitaries during a pogrom against the minority tamil population in the sikh religion , any copies of their sacred book , guru granth sahib , which are too badly damaged to be used , and any printer 's waste which bears any of its text , are cremated in his 1821 play , almansor , the german writer heinrich heine – referring to the burning of the muslim holy book , the qur'an , during the spanish inquisition – wrote , '' where they burn books , so too will they in the end burn human beings '' ) over a century later , heine 's own books were among the thousands of volumes that were torched by the nazis in berlin 's bebelplatz , even while his poem die lorelei continued to be printed in german schoolbooks as '' by an unknown author ''
