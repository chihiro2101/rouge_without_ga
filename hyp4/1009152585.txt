the recommendations are as follows : if the patient has another medical condition or taking other medication that may increase bleeding risk , consult the patient 's general medical practitioner or specialist if the patient is on a short course anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy , delay non-urgent , invasive procedure , until the medication has been discontinued plan treatment for early in the day and week , where possible , to allow time for the management of prolonged bleeding or re-bleeding , if it occurs perform the procedure as atraumatically as possible , use appropriate local measures and only discharge patient once hemostasis has been confirmed if travel time to emergency care is a concern , place particular emphasis at the time of the initial treatment on the use of measures to avoid complications advise the patient to take paracetamol , unless contraindicated , for pain relief rather than nsaids such as aspirin , ibuprofen , diclofenac or naproxen provide the patient with written post-treatment advice and emergency contact details follow the specific recommendations and advice given for the management of patients taking the different anticoagulants or antiplatelet drugs there is general agreement that in most cases , treatment regimens with older anticoagulants ( e.g assessing bleeding risk there are 2 main parts to the assessment of bleeding risk : assessment of the likely risk of bleeding associated with the required dental procedure assessment of the patient 's individual level bleeding risk managing bleeding risk a patient who is on anticoagulants or antiplatelet medications may undergo dental treatments which are unlikely to cause bleeding such as local anaesthesia injection , basic gum charting , removal of plaque , calculus and stain above the gum level , direct or indirect fillings which are above the gingiva , root canal treatment , taking impression for denture or crown and fitting or adjustment of orthodontics , patients with other medical conditions or undergoing more extensive procedures associated with higher bleeding risk ) , consideration may be given , in consultation with and on advice of the patient 's physician , to postponing the timing of the daily dose of the anticoagulant until after the procedure ; timing the dental intervention as late as possible after last dose of anticoagulant ; or temporarily interrupting drug therapy for 24 to 48 hours for a patient who needs to undergo dental treatments which is more likely to cause bleeding such as simple tooth extractions ( 1-3 teeth with small wound size ) , drainage of swelling inside the mouth , periodontal charting , root planing , & nbsp ; direct or indirect filling which extends below the gingiva , complex filling , flap raising procedure , gingival recontouring and biopsies , the dentist needs to take extra precautions apart from the standard procedure the development of darexaban was discontinued in september 2011 : in a trial for prevention of recurrences of myocardial infarction in addition to dual antiplatelet therapy ( dapt ) , the drug did not demonstrate effectiveness and the risk of bleeding was increased by approximately 300 % reversal agents for warfarin are more widely studied and established guidelines for reversal exist , due to longer history of use of warfarin and the ability to get a more accurate measurement of anticoagulation effect in a patient via measuring the inr ( international normalized ratio ) since the 2000s a number of agents have been introduced that are collectively referred to as directly acting oral anticoagulants ( doacs ) , novel oral anticoagulants ( noacs ) , or non-vitamin k antagonist oral anticoagulants heparin can be used in vivo ( by injection ) , and also in vitro to prevent blood or plasma clotting in or on medical devices detecting overdose an overdose in anticoagulants usually occurs in people who have heart problems and need to take anticoagulants in a long term , in order to reduce the risk of stroke from their high blood pressure an oral direct thrombin inhibitor , ximelagatran ( exanta ) was denied approval by the food and drug administration ( fda ) in september 2004 and was pulled from the market entirely in february 2006 after reports of severe liver damage and heart attacks citrate is in liquid form in the tube and is used for coagulation tests , as well as in blood transfusion bags these anticoagulants are used to treat patients with deep-vein thrombosis ( dvt ) , pulmonary embolism ( pe ) and to prevent emboli in patients with atrial fibrillation ( af ) , and mechanical prosthetic heart valves foods and food supplements with blood-thinning effects include nattokinase , lumbrokinase , beer , bilberry , celery , cranberry , fish oil , garlic , ginger , ginkgo , ginseng , green tea , horse chestnut , licorice , niacin , onion , papaya , pomegranate , red clover , soybean , st ) antithrombin is approved by the fda as an anticoagulant for the prevention of clots before , during , or after surgery or birthing in patients with hereditary antithrombin deficiency , dabigatran , rivaroxaban , apixaban , or edoxaban ) and undergoing dental treatment ( in conjunction with usual local measures to control bleeding ) , no change to the anticoagulant regimen is required grapefruit interferes with some anticoagulant drugs , increasing the amount of time it takes for them to be metabolized out of the body , and so should be eaten with caution when on anticoagulant drugs the inr test measures the time taken for a clot to form in a blood sample , relative to a standard these agents include direct thrombin inhibitor ( dabigatran ) and factor xa inhibitor ( rivaroxaban , apixaban , betrixaban and edoxaban ) and they have been shown to be as good or possibly better than the coumarins with less serious side effects complex extractions , adjacent extractions leading to large wound or more than three extractions ) , the recommended practice is for patient to miss or delay a dose of their doac before such procedures so as to minimize the effect on bleeding risk however , in urgent settings , or in settings with extremely high inr ( inr > 20 ) , hemostatic reversal agents such as fresh frozen plasma ( ffp ) , recombinant factor viia , and prothrombin complex concentrate ( pcc ) have been utilized with proven efficacy bleeding risk is especially important to consider in patients with renal impairment and noac therapy due to the fact that all noacs , to some extent , are excreted by the kidneys the antithrombin protein itself is used as a protein therapeutic that can be purified from human plasma or produced recombinantly ( for example , atryn , which is produced in the milk of genetic engineering goats , factor v leiden ) — can lead to deep vein thrombosis mechanical heart valves myocardial infarction pulmonary embolism restenosis from stents cardiopulmonary bypass ( or any other surgeries requiring temporary aortic occlusion ) heart failure in these cases , anticoagulation therapy can prevent formation of dangerous clots or prevent growth of clots in patients with other existing medical conditions that can increase the risk of prolonged bleeding after dental treatment or who are receiving other therapy that can increase bleeding risk , dental practitioners may wish to consult the patient 's physician to determine whether care can safely be delivered in a primary care office although specific antidotes and reversal agents for doacs are not as widely studied , idarucizumab ( for dabigatran ) and andexanet alfa ( for factor xa inhibitor ) have been used in clinical settings with varying efficacy a prominent member of this class is warfarin ( coumadin ) and was found to be the dominant anticoagulant prescribed in a large multispecialty practice some indications for anticoagulant therapy that are known to have benefit from therapy include : atrial fibrillation — commonly forms an right atrium clot coronary artery disease deep vein thrombosis — can lead to pulmonary embolism ischemic stroke hypercoagulable states ( e.g other adverse effects of warfarin are associated with depletion of vitamin k , which can lead to inhibition of g1a proteins and growth arrest-specific gene 6 , which can lead to increased risk of arterial calcification and heart valve , especially if too much vitamin d is present with low bleeding risk of dental procedures , it is recommended that doac medicine still be taken by the patient as per normal , so as to avoid increase in the risk of thromboembolic event compared to warfarin , doacs have a rapid onset action and relatively short half-lives ; hence , they carry out their function more rapidly and effectively and allow for drugs to quickly reduce their anticoagulation effects
