this is an illustration of the law of increase of entropy through boltzmann 's identification of the logarithm of the number of states with the entropy many other phenomena , such as the relative motion of bodies with friction , or viscous motion of fluids , reduce to this , because the underlying mechanism is the dissipation of usable energy ( for example , kinetic energy ) into heat by eventually making one side of the room cooler than before and the other hotter , it seems to reduce the entropy of the room , and reverse the arrow of time in this view , the apparent t-asymmetry of our universe is a problem in cosmology : why did the universe start with a low entropy ? this view , supported by cosmological observation ( such as the isotropy of the cosmic microwave background , connect this problem to the question of initial conditions of the universe the modern view of black hole irreversibility is to relate it to the second law of thermodynamics , since black holes are viewed as thermodynamic objects for example , according to the gaugeâ€“gravity duality conjecture , all microscopic processes in a black hole are reversible , and only the collective behavior is irreversible , as in any other macroscopic , thermal system classical variables that do not change upon time reversal include : : \vec x , position of a particle in three-space : \vec a , acceleration of the particle : \vec f , force on the particle : e , energy of the particle : v , electric potential ( voltage ) : \vec e , electric field : \vec d , electric displacement : \rho , density of electric charge : \vec p , electric polarization : energy density of the electromagnetic field : t_ , are characterized by a multiplicative quantum number , sometimes called the t-parity there are two possible origins of this asymmetry , one through the mixing of different flavours of quarks in their weak decays , the second through a direct cp violation in strong interactions time reversal violation is unrelated to the second law of thermodynamics , because due to the conservation of the cpt symmetry , the effect of time reversal is to rename particles as antiparticles and vice versa strong measurements ( both classical and quantum ) are certainly disturbing , causing asymmetry due to the second law of thermodynamics this type of asymmetry is independent of cpt symmetry but has not yet been confirmed experimentally due to extreme conditions of the checking proposal .
