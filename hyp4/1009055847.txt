on their 2001 product web page , nvidia initially placed the ultra as a separate offering from the rest of the geforce 2 lineup ( gts , pro , ti ) , however by late 2002 with the geforce 2 considered a discontinued product line , the ultra was included along the gts , pro , and ti in the geforce 2 information page nvidia has ceased driver support for geforce 2 series , ending with gts , pro , ti and ultra models in 2005 and then with mx models in 2007 the non-mx geforce 2 line was reduced in price and saw the addition of the geforce 2 ti , in order to offer a mid-range alternative to the high-end geforce 3 product in order to create a better low-end option , nvidia created the geforce 2 mx series , which offered a set of standard features , specific to the entire geforce 2 generation , limited only by categorical tier the first models to arrive after the original geforce 2 gts was the geforce 2 ultra and geforce2 mx , launched on september 7 , 2000 geforce 2 gts , geforce 2 pro , geforce 2 ti and geforce 2 ultra : windows 9x & windows me : 71.84 released on march 11 , 2005 ; download ; : product support list windows 95/98/me â€“ 71.84 faster than the gts and pro but slower than the ultra , the geforce 2 ti performed competitively against the radeon r100 , although the 7500 had the advantage of dual-display support the geforce 2 pro , introduced shortly after the ultra , was an alternative to the expensive top-line ultra and is faster than the gts the prime competitors to the geforce 2 mx series were ati 's radeon r100 and radeon sdr ( which with the other r100 's was later renamed as part of the 7200 series ) this doubles the texture fillrate per clock compared to the previous generation and is the reasoning behind the geforce 2 gts 's naming suffix : gigatexel shader ( gts )
