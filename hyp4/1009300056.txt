preamble general principle 's ( chapter 1 ) the fundamental rights and duties of citizens ( chapter 2 ) the structure of the state ( chapter 3 ) — which includes such state organs as the national people 's congress , the state council , the local people 's congress and local people 's governments and the people 's courts and the people 's procuratorates the national flag , the national anthem , the national emblem and the capital ( chapter 4 ) article 1 of the state constitution describes china as '' a socialist state under the people 's democratic dictatorship '' meaning that the system is based on an alliance of the working classes—in communist terminology , the workers and peasants—and is led by the communist party , the vanguard of the working class in fact , the constitution omits all references to the cultural revolution and restates chairman mao zedong 's contributions in accordance with a major historical reassessment produced in june 1981 at the sixth plenum of the eleventh central committee , the '' resolution on some historical issues of the party since the founding of the people 's republic unlike the 1977 soviet constitution , the text of the constitution itself does n't explicitly mention the chinese communist party and there is an explicit statement in article 5 that the constitution and law are supreme over all organizations and individuals probably because of the excesses that filled the years of the cultural revolution , the 1982 constitution gives even greater attention to clarifying citizens ' '' fundamental rights and duties '' than the 1954 constitution did , like the right to vote and to run for election begins at the age of eighteen except for those disenfranchised by law '' article 35 of the 1982 state constitution proclaims that '' citizens of the people 's republic of china enjoy freedom of speech , of the press , of assembly , of association , of procession , and of demonstration '' in the 1978 constitution , these rights were guaranteed , but so were the right to strike and the '' four big rights '' , often called the '' four bigs '' : to speak out freely , air views fully , hold great debates , and write big-character posters as chinese citizens are categorized into rural resident and town resident , and the constitution has no stipulation of freedom of transference , those rural residents are restricted by the hukou ( registered permanent residence ) and have fewer political , economic , and educational rights it stipulates the npc as the highest organ of state authority power , under which the state council , the supreme people 's court , and the supreme people 's procuratorate shall be elected and responsible for the npc whereas the 1978 constitution stressed '' self-reliance '' in modernization efforts , the 1982 document provides the constitutional basis for the considerable body of laws passed by the npc in subsequent years permitting and encouraging extensive foreign participation in all aspects of the economy the cpc thereby endeavors to represent : the development trend of china 's advanced productive forces , the orientation of china 's advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the chinese people the constitution was amended on 14 march 2004 to include guarantees regarding private property ( '' legally obtained private property of the citizens shall not be violated '' ) and human rights ( '' the state respects and protects human rights '' ) it includes an assortment of revisions that further cement the communist party ’ s control and supremacy , including setting up the national supervisory commission , establishing a new anti-graft agency , extending the powers of the communist party ’ s graft watchdog , adding hu jintao 's scientific outlook on development and xi jinping thought to the preamble of the constitution , and removing term limits for both the president and vice president , enabling xi jinping to remain president indefinitely constitutional preambles are often not legally binding ( as with the united states constitution ) , and as the legal applicability of the chinese constitution is debated the amendment may be seen as providing a constitutional basis for china ’ s status as a one-party state and formally rendering any competitive multi-party system unconstitutional the constitution stipulates that the national people 's congress ( npc ) and its standing committee have the power to review whether laws or activities violate the constitution since 2002 , a special committee within the npc called the national people 's congress constitution and law committee has been responsible for constitutional review and enforcement however , in one case , after media outcry over the sun zhigang incident the state council was forced to rescind regulations allowing police to detain persons without residency permits after the standing committee of the national people 's congress ( npcsc ) made it clear that it would rule such regulations unconstitutional the open constitution initiative was an organization consisting of lawyers and academics in the people 's republic of china that advocated the rule of law and greater constitutional protections
