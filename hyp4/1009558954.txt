the term '' genetic relationship '' is meant in the genealogical sense of historical linguistics , which groups most languages spoken in the world today into a relatively small number of families , according to reconstructed descent from common ancestral languages a '' genetic relationship '' is a connection between languages , like similarities in vocabulary or grammar , that can be attributed to a common ancestral proto-language that diverged into multiple languages or branches similarly , if deaf parents were to raise a group of hearing children who have no contact with others until adulthood , those children might develop an oral idioglossia and keep using it later , teaching it to their children , and so on with unsigned languages , this is not very likely to occur at any one time but , over the tens of thousands of years of human prehistory , the likelihood of this occurring at least a few times increases there are also creole languages and constructed languages such as esperanto , which do not descend directly from a single ancestor but have become the language of a population ; however , they do take elements from existing languages despite their great age , sumerian and elamite can be safely classified as isolates , as the languages are well enough known that , if modern relatives existed , they would be recognizably related however , many extinct languages are very poorly attested , and the fact that they can not be linked to other languages may be a reflection of our poor knowledge of them a language thought to be an isolate may turn out to be relatable to other languages once enough material is recovered , but material is unlikely to be recovered if a language was not documented in writing muzale , university of dar es salaam , 2003 sign languages have also developed outside schools , in communities with high incidences of deafness , such as kata kolok in bali , the adamorobe sign language in ghana , the urubu sign language in brazil , several mayan sign languages , and half a dozen sign languages of the hill tribes in thailand including the ban khor sign language these and more are all presumed isolates or small local families , because many deaf communities are made up of people whose hearing parents do not use sign language , and have manifestly , as shown by the language itself , not borrowed their sign language from other deaf communities during the recorded history of these languages however , the genetic unity of some language families , like nilo-saharan , is questionable , and so there may be many more language families and isolates than currently accepted
