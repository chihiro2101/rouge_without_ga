'' although the neighboring states of arkansas , louisiana , and missouri would also produce boogie-woogie players and their boogie-woogie tunes , and despite the fact that chicago would become known as the center for this music through such pianists as jimmy yancey , albert ammons , and meade lux lewis , texas was home to an environment that fostered creation of boogie-style : the lumber , cattle , turpentine , and oil industries , all served by an expanding railway system from the northern corner of east texas to the gulf coast and from the louisiana border to dallas and west texas the city of marshall , texas is committed to cooperating with any and all efforts to unearth boogie-woogie history and to honor , celebrate , and re-create the vibrant environment that was catalytic to the creation of the most entertaining , revolutionary , and influential of all american musical forms tennison states : '' given the account of elliot paul , and given that lead belly witnessed boogie-woogie in 1899 in the arklatex ; and given the north to south migration of the thomas family ; and given the texas & pacific headquarters in marshall in the early 1870s ; and given that harrison county had the largest slave population in the state of texas ; and given the fact that the best-documented and largest-scale turpentine camps in texas did not occur until after 1900 in southeast texas , it is most probable that boogie-woogie spread from northeast to southeast texas , rather than from southeast to northeast texas , or by having developed diffusely with an even density over all of the piney woods of east texas '' on may 13 , 2010 , the marshall city commission enacted an official declaration naming marshall as the '' birthplace '' of boogie-woogie music , and embarked on a program to encourage additional historical research and to stimulate interest in and appreciation for the early african-american culture in northeast texas that played a vital role in creating boogie-woogie music also from 1939 , the will bradley orchestra had a string of boogie hits such as the original versions of '' beat me daddy , eight to the bar '' and '' down the road a piece '' , both 1940 , and '' scrub me mamma with a boogie beat '' , in 1941 according to tennison , '' although some boogie woogie bass figures were present in prior sheet music , the thing that made 'the fives ' so special was the greater amount and variety of boogie woogie bass figures that were present in the music as compared to boogie woogie bass figures that had been present in previously published sheet music , such as the 1915 '' weary blues '' by artie matthews the first time the modern-day spelling of '' boogie-woogie '' was used in a title of a published audio recording of music appears to be pine top smith 's december 1928 recording titled '' pine top 's boogie woogie '' , a song whose lyrics contain dance instructions to '' boogie-woogie '' the earliest documented inquiries into the geographical origin of boogie-woogie occurred in the late 1930s when oral histories from the oldest living americans of both african and european descent revealed a broad consensus that boogie-woogie piano was first played in texas in the early 1870s in 1948 arthur smith achieved top 10 us country chart success with his mgm records recordings of '' guitar boogie '' and '' banjo boogie '' , with the former crossing over to the us pop chart , introducing many people to the potential of the electric guitar tommy dorsey 's band recorded an updated version of '' pine top 's boogie woogie '' in 1938 , which ( as '' boogie woogie '' ) became a hit in 1943 and 1945 , and was to become the swing era 's second best seller , only second to glenn miller 's '' in the mood '' a key to identifying the geographical area in which boogie-woogie originated is understanding the relationship of boogie-woogie music with the steam railroad , both in the sense of how the music might have been influenced by sounds associated with the arrival of steam locomotives as well as the cultural impact the sudden emergence of the railroad might have had indeed , all modern boogie-woogie bass figures can be found in '' the fives '' , including swinging , walking broken-octave bass , shuffled ( swinging ) chord bass ( of the sort later used extensively by ammons , lewis , and clarence '' pine top '' smith ) , and the ubiquitous '' oom-pah '' ragtime stride bass in january 2010 , john tennison summarized his research into the origins of boogie-woogie with the conclusion that marshall , texas is '' the municipality whose boundaries are most likely to encompass or be closest to the point on the map which is the geographic center of gravity for all instances of boogie woogie performance between 1870 and 1880 '' in the 1986 television broadcast of britain 's the south bank show about boogie-woogie , music historian paul oliver noted : '' now the conductors were used to the logging camp pianists clamoring aboard , telling them a few stories , jumping off the train , getting into another logging camp , and playing again for eight hours , barrel house simms campbell , jazzmen : the story of hot jazz told in the lives of the men who created it , 1939 , chapter 4 : '' blues '' , pp beginning with the formation of the texas western railroad company in marshall , texas , through the subsequent establishment in 1871 of the texas and pacific railway company , which located its headquarters and shops there , marshall was the only railroad hub in the piney woods of northeast texas at the time the music developed the sudden appearance of steam locomotives , and the building of mainline tracks and tap lines to serve logging operations was pivotal to the creation of the music in terms of its sound and rhythm in 1901 , '' hoogie boogie '' appeared in the title of published sheet music , the first known instance where a redoubling of the word '' boogie '' occurs in the title of published music alan lomax wrote : '' anonymous black musicians , longing to grab a train and ride away from their troubles , incorporated the rhythms of the steam locomotive and the moan of their whistles into the new dance music they were playing in jukes and dance halls from the primitive to the complex , those identifications indicate that the most primitive form of the music was associated with marshall , texas â€“ and that the left-hand bass lines grew more complex as the distance from marshall increased one notable country boogie from this period was the delmore brothers '' freight train boogie '' , considered to be part of the combined evolution of country music and blues towards rockabilly '' '' 5 boogie woogie piano solos by all-star composers '' ( a book of sheet music ) , copyright 1942 , edited by frank paparelli , leeds music corporation , rko building , radio city , new york , ny in the many styles of blues , especially chicago blues and ( more recently ) west coast blues , some pianists and guitarists were influenced by , and employed , the traditional boogie-woogie styles smith 's record was the first boogie-woogie recording to be a commercial hit , and helped establish '' boogie-woogie '' as the name of the style it is a simple , four-beats-to-the-bar figure the second-most primitive bass-line , called '' the jefferson '' , is also four-beats-to-the-bar , but goes down in pitch on the last note in each four-note cycle the charlie daniels band ( whose earlier tune '' the south 's gon na do it again '' uses boogie-woogie influences ) released '' boogie woogie fiddle country blues '' in 1988 , and three years later in 1991 brooks & dunn had a huge hit with '' boot scootin ' boogie '' jefferson , texas , about 17 miles north of marshall , was the westernmost port of a steamboat route that connected to new orleans via caddo lake , the red river , and the mississippi river according to tennison , when he interviewed lee ree sullivan in texarkana in 1986 , sullivan told him that he was familiar with '' fast western '' and '' fast texas '' as terms to refer to boogie-woogie in general , but not to denote the use of any specific bass figure used in boogie-woogie several african terms have been suggested as having some interesting linguistic precursors to '' boogie '' : among them are the : hausa word '' boog '' , and mandingo word '' booga '' ( both of which mean '' to beat '' , as in beating a drum ) west african word '' bogi '' ( which means '' to dance '' ) the south bank show ( uk television series ) , episode on boogie woogie , 1986 , with commentary by paul oliver in sheet music literature prior to 1900 , there are at least three examples of the word '' boogie '' in music titles in the archives of the library of congress otis spann and pinetop perkins , two of the best known blues pianists , are heavily boogie-woogie influenced , with the latter taking both his name and signature tune from
