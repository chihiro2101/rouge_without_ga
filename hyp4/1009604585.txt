as a construct and measured by measuring , intelligence is considered to be one of the most useful concepts used in psychology , because it correlates with many relevant variables , for instance the probability of suffering an accident , salary , and more some suggest that the reason for the correlation is environmental , whereby people with a higher iq are more likely to damage their eyesight with prolonged reading , or the other way around whereby people who read more are more likely to reach a higher iq , while others contend that a genetic link exists however , while iq test scores show a high degree of inter-test reliability , and predict certain forms of achievement rather effectively , their construct validity as a holistic measure of human intelligence is considered dubious while iq tests are generally understood to measure some forms of intelligence , they may fail to serve as an accurate measure of broader definitions of human intelligence inclusive of creativity and social intelligence howard gardner 's theory of multiple intelligences is based on studies not only of normal children and adults , but also of gifted individuals ( including so-called '' savants '' ) , of persons who have suffered brain damage , of experts and virtuosos , and of individuals from diverse cultures in the first edition of his book frames of mind ( 1983 ) , he described seven distinct types of intelligence—logical-mathematical , linguistic , spatial , musical , kinesthetic , interpersonal , and intrapersonal article in wikipedia : intelligence : knowns and unknowns a major criticism of gardner 's theory is that it has never been tested , or subjected to peer review , by gardner or anyone else , and indeed that it is unfalsifiable on the other hand , jerome bruner agreed with gardner that the intelligences were '' useful fictions '' , and went on to state that '' his approach is so far beyond the data-crunching of mental testers that it deserves to be cheered intrapersonal intelligence : it is a capacity to form an accurate , veridical model of oneself and to be able to use that model to operate effectively in life creative intelligence is necessary when an individual is confronted with a challenge that is nearly , but not entirely , novel or when an individual is engaged in automatizing the performance of a task the triarchic theory does not argue against the validity of a general intelligence factor ; instead , the theory posits that general intelligence is part of analytic intelligence , and only by considering all three aspects of intelligence can the full range of intellectual functioning be fully understood the processing skills are applied to the pursuit of success through what were the three elements of practical intelligence : adapting to , shaping of , and selecting of one 's environments neuroethics considers the ethical , legal and social implications of neuroscience , and deals with issues such as the difference between treating a human neurological disease and enhancing the human brain , and how wealth impacts access to neurotechnology iq and g ( discussed in the next section ) are correlated with many important social outcomes—individuals with low iqs are more likely to be divorced , have a child out of marriage , be incarcerated , and need long-term welfare support , while individuals with high iqs are associated with more years of education , higher status jobs and higher income he interpreted it as the core of human intelligence that , to a larger or smaller degree , influences success in all cognitive tasks and thereby creates the positive manifold this is problematic , however , because there are substantial gender differences on the raven 's , which are not found when g is measured directly by computing the general factor from a broad collection of tests a recent scientific understanding of collective intelligence , defined as a group 's general ability to perform a wide range of tasks , expands the areas of human intelligence research applying similar methods and concepts to groups definition , operationalization and methods are similar to the psychometric approach of general individual intelligence where an individual 's performance on a given set of cognitive tasks is used to measure intelligence indicated by the g factor ( psychometrics ) extracted via factor analysis kaufman , 2009 , springer publishing company , fluid intelligence ( gf ) : includes the broad ability to reason , form concepts , and solve problems using unfamiliar information or novel procedures crystallized intelligence ( gc ) : includes the breadth and depth of a person 's acquired knowledge , the ability to communicate one 's knowledge , and the ability to reason using previously learned experiences or procedures visual processing ( gv ) : is the ability to perceive , analyze , synthesize , and think with visual patterns , including the ability to store and recall visual representations auditory processing ( ga ) : is the ability to analyze , synthesize , and discriminate auditory stimuli , including the ability to process and discriminate speech sounds that may be presented under distorted conditions decision/reaction time/speed ( gt ) : reflect the immediacy with which an individual can react to stimuli or a task ( typically measured in seconds or fractions of seconds ; not to be confused with gs , which typically is measured in intervals of 2–3 minutes ) the mismeasure of man , stephen jay gould , norton , 1996 a reply has been that drawing conclusions from early intelligence research is like condemning the auto industry by criticizing the performance of the model t several critics , such as stephen jay gould , have been critical of g , seeing it as a statistical artifact , and that iq tests instead measure a number of unrelated abilities robert sternberg is among the researchers who have discussed how one 's culture affects the person 's interpretation of intelligence , and he further believes that to define intelligence in only one way without considering different meanings in cultural contexts may cast an investigative and unintentionally egocentric view on the world a chinese conception of intelligence would define it as the ability to empathize with and understand others — although this is by no means the only way that intelligence is defined in china for example , in the language of chi-chewa , which is spoken by some ten million people across central africa , the equivalent term for intelligence implies not only cleverness but also the ability to take on responsibility one of the most common views on intelligence within american societies defines it as a combination of problem-solving skills , deductive reasoning skills , and iq ( iq ) , while other american societies point out that intelligent people should have a social conscience , accept others for who they are , and be able to give advice or wisdom
