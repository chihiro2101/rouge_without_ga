. food and drink the food retail industry has started to apply automation to the ordering process ; mcdonald 's has introduced touch screen ordering and payment systems in many of its restaurants , reducing the need for as many cashier employees currently , it can still require a large amount of human capital , particularly in the third world where labor costs are low so there is less incentive for increasing efficiency through automation the defense advanced research projects agency ( darpa ) started the research and development of automated visual surveillance and monitoring ( vsam ) program , between 1997 and 1999 , and airborne video surveillance ( avs ) programs , from 1998 to 2002 , indoor , outdoor or airborne , the number of sensors that the automated system can handle and the mobility of sensors , i.e the purpose of a surveillance system is to record properties and trajectories of objects in a given area , generate warnings or notify the designated authorities in case of occurrence of particular events seeking to accelerate the development and introduction of fully automated vehicles and highways , the united states congress authorized more than 650 million over six years for intelligent transport systems ( its ) and demonstration projects in the 1991 intermodal surface transportation efficiency act ( istea ) full automation commonly defined as requiring no control or very limited control by the driver ; such automation would be accomplished through a combination of sensor , computer , and communications systems in vehicles and along the roadway other potential benefits include improved air quality ( as a result of more-efficient traffic flows ) , increased fuel economy , and spin-off technologies generated during research and development related to automated highway systems home automation ( also called domotics ) designates an emerging practice of increased automation of household appliances and features in residential dwellings , particularly through electronic means that allow for things impracticable , overly expensive or simply not possible in recent past decades industrial automation deals primarily with the automation of manufacturing , quality control , and material handling processes industrial automation is to replace the decision making of humans and manual command-response activities with the use of mechanized equipment and logical programming commands one trend is increased use of machine vision to provide automatic inspection and robot guidance functions , another is a continuing increase in the use of robots originating from germany , industry 4.0 encompasses numerous devices , concepts , and machines , as well as the advancement of the industrial internet of things ( iiot ) '' these new revolutionary advancements have drawn attention to the world of automation in an entirely new light and shown ways for it to grow to increase productivity and efficiency in machinery and manufacturing facilities industrial robots use various mechanical , electrical as well as software systems to allow for high precision , accuracy and speed that far exceed any human performance servos , digital logic and solid-state electronics allowed engineers to build better and faster systems and over time these systems were improved and revised to the point where a single robot is capable of running 24 hours a day with little or no maintenance in 1997 , there were 700,000 industrial robots in use , the number has risen to 1.8m in 2017 in recent years , artificial intelligence ( ai ) with robotics is also used in creating an automatic labeling solution , using robotic arms as the automatic label applicator , and ai for learning and detecting the products to be labelled using a logic-based language , a plc can receive a variety of inputs and return a variety of logical outputs , the input devices being sensors and output devices being motors , valves , etc thumb plcs can range from small '' building brick '' devices with tens of i/o in a housing integral with the processor , to large rack-mounted modular devices with a count of thousands of i/o , and which are often networked to other plc and scada systems before the plc , control , sequencing , and safety interlock logic for manufacturing automobiles was mainly composed of relays , cam timers , drum sequencers , and dedicated closed-loop controllers since these could number in the hundreds or even thousands , the process for updating such facilities for the yearly model changeover was very time-consuming and expensive , as electricians needed to individually rewire the relays to change their operational characteristics it would tolerate the shop-floor environment , it would support discrete ( bit-form ) input and output in an easily extensible manner , it would not require years of training to use , and it would permit its operation to be monitored automated storage and retrieval system automation technician cognitive computing control engineering cybernetics data-driven control system dirty , dangerous and demeaning feedforward control futures studies industrial revolution ludditism machine to machine mobile manipulator multi-agent system post-work society process control productivity improving technologies robot tax robotic process automation semi-automation industry 4.0 technological unemployment
