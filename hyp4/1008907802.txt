on the other hand , the '' render unto caesar '' of the synoptic gospels acknowledges the possibility of distinct loyalties ( secular and religious ) without conflict , but if loyalty to man conflicts with loyalty to god , the latter takes precedence the encyclopædia britannica eleventh edition defines loyalty as '' allegiance to the sovereign or established government of one 's country '' and also '' personal devotion and reverence to the sovereign and royal family '' it traces the word '' loyalty '' to the 15th century , noting that then it primarily referred to fidelity in service , in love , or to an oath that one has made the meaning that the britannica gives as primary , it attributes to a shift during the 16th century , noting that the origin of the word is in the old french '' loialte '' , that is in turn rooted in the latin '' lex '' , meaning '' law '' one who is loyal , in the feudal sense of fealty , is one who is lawful ( as opposed to an outlaw ) , who has full legal rights as a consequence of faithful allegiance to a feudal lord the short definition that he gives of the idea is that loyalty is '' the willing and practical and thoroughgoing devotion of a person to a cause '' royce 's view of loyalty was challenged by ladd in the article on '' loyalty '' in the first edition of the macmillan encyclopedia of philosophy ( 1967 ) ralls ( 1968 ) observes that ladd 's article is the macmillan encyclopaedias only article on a virtue , and praises it for its '' magnificent '' declaration by ladd that '' a loyal nazi is a contradiction in terms '' duska , the lamont post chair of ethics and the professions at the american college , extends ladd 's objection , saying that it is a perversion of ethics and virtue for one 's self-will to be identified with anything , as royce would have it examples of this , which are unequivocally considered to be instances of loyalty , are loyalty by a person to his or her family , to a team that he or she is a member or fan of , or to his or her country john kleinig , professor of philosophy at city university of new york , observes that over the years the idea has been treated by writers from aeschylus through john galsworthy to joseph conrad , by psychologists , psychiatrists , sociologists , scholars of religion , political economists , scholars of business and marketing , and—most particularly—by political theorists , who deal with it in terms of loyalty oaths and patriotism baron ( 1984 ) , disagree amongst themselves as to the proper object of loyalty—what it is possible to be loyal to , in other words ladd , as stated , considers loyalty to be interpersonal , and that the object of loyalty is always a person in the encyclopaedia of the history of ideas , konvitz states that the objects of loyalty encompass principles , causes , ideas , ideals , religions , ideologies , nations , governments , parties , leaders , families , friends , regions , racial groups , and '' anyone or anything to which one 's heart can become attached or devoted '' baron agrees with ladd , inasmuch as loyalty is '' to certain people or to a group of people , not loyalty to an ideal or cause '' stephen nathanson , professor of philosophy at northeastern university , states that loyalty can be either exclusionary or non-exclusionary ; and can be single or multiple one can , for example , be loyal to one 's friends , or one 's family , and still , without contradiction , be loyal to one 's religion , or profession they may be constructed upon the basis of unalterable facts that constitute a personal connection between the subject and the object of the loyalty , such as biological ties or place of birth ( a notion of natural allegiance propounded by socrates in his political theory ) they range from loyalties with limited scope , that require few actions of the subject , to loyalties with broad or even unlimited scopes , which require many actions , or indeed to do whatever may be necessary in support of the loyalty at the other end of the spectrum , past the middle ground of considering some loyalties as legitimate and others not , according to cases , or plain and simple indifference to other people 's loyalties , is the positive regard of other people 's loyalties ) the ethics of whistleblowing thus encompass a conflicting multiplicity of loyalties , where the traditional loyalty of the employee to the employer conflicts with the loyalty of the employee to his or her community , which the employer 's business practices may be adversely affecting duska resolves the conflict by asserting that there is really only one proper object of loyalty in such instances , the community , a position that vandekerckhove counters by arguing that businesses are in need of employee loyalty john corvino , associate professor of philosophy at wayne state university takes a different tack , arguing that loyalty can sometimes be a vice , not a virtue , and that '' loyalty is only a virtue to the extent that the object of loyalty is good '' ( similar to nathanson ) vandekerckhove suggests that duska and corvino combine , however , to point in a direction that makes it possible to resolve the conflict of loyalties in the context of whistleblowing , by clarifying the objects of those loyalties the bible also speaks of loyal ones , which would be those who follow the bible with absolute loyalty , as in '' precious in the eyes of god is the death of his loyal ones '' ( psalms 116:15 ) most jewish and christian authors view the binding of isaac ( genesis 22 ) , in which abraham was called by god to offer his son isaac as a burnt offering , as a test of abraham 's loyalty famous cases include greyfriars bobby , a skye terrier who attended his master 's grave for fourteen years ; hachiko , a dog who returned to the place he used to meet his master every day for nine years after his death ; and foxie , the spaniel belonging to charles gough , who stayed by her dead master 's side for three months on helvellyn in the lake district in 1805 ( although it is possible that foxie had eaten gough 's body )
