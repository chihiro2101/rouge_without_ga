the 4kids-produced block , which by that point had become 4kids tv , ended its run on december 27 , 2008 , fox opted to drop children 's programming altogether rather than lease the block to another company , becoming the third broadcast network ( after ion television ( then known as pax tv , which discontinued its pax kids lineup in 2000 , before reviving children 's programming as i : independent television through the 2006 launch of qubo ) and upn ) to completely abandon children 's programming , and replaced 4kids tv with a two-hour infomercial block called weekend marketplace ; as with 4kids tv and its predecessors , fox has allowed several stations the option to decline to carry the block and lease it to another station in the market , especially those stations which had never carried fox kids following the 1994–1996 united states broadcast television realignment resulting from fox 's 1994 affiliation agreement with new world pictures a 1996 federal communications commission mandate , issued in the wake of the regulations on children 's television programming in the united states , requires that stations program a minimum of three hours of children 's regulations on children 's television programming in the united states ( '' e/i '' ) programming per week independent station ( tv stations not affiliated with networks ) often did not show cartoons on saturday mornings , instead running feature films ( usually western or low-budget series movies such as the bowery boys or bomba , the jungle boy ) , chapters of '' cliffhanger '' serial film , comedy short film originally made for movie theatres ( laurel and hardy , the three stooges , and our gang ) , older live-action syndicated series like the adventures of superman , the cisco kid , ramar of the jungle , the abbott and costello show , the adventures of robin hood , hopalong cassidy , flash gordon , and sheena , queen of the jungle , and regional sports shows , often wrestling or bowling programs defining cartoons of the '80s that had associated toy lines , but which were not created specifically for the purpose of selling toys , included teenage mutant ninja turtles , which began as an independent comic-book series , and the real ghostbusters , based on the live-action movie from 1984 ; both continued to be produced into the '90s , and in fact ninja turtles lasted so long that most of its episodes were produced and aired in the '90s , though it is still associated more with the '80s nbc replaced that block with qubo , a three-hour '' educational entertainment '' block that debuted on september 9 , 2006 ( with accompanying blocks on co-owned spanish network telemundo on weekend mornings and on ion television once weekly ) , as part of a programming partnership between parent company nbcuniversal , ion media , scholastic corporation , nelvana and dreamworks classics , that resulted in the creation of a companion digital multicast network on ion television 's stations ; the qubo blocks on nbc and telemundo ended on june 30 , 2012 , leaving only the ion block and standalone qubo channel in the 1990s , television in japan shows targeted towards children and teenagers were introduced to american television , including live-action tokusatsu superhero shows such as power rangers ( super sentai ) and vr troopers ( metal hero series ) , and anime shows such as pokémon , dragon ball , sailor moon , digimon and yu-gi-oh ! this led to a transition in the saturday-morning slot from traditional american saturday-morning cartoons towards japanese anime , which have dominated the saturday-morning timeslot since the 1990s with the 1970s came a wave of animated versions of popular live-action prime time series , mainly with the voices of the original casts , including the brady bunch ( the brady kids ) , star trek ( star trek : the animated series ) , emergency ! ( emergency+4 ) , gilligan 's island ( the new adventures of gilligan and later gilligan 's planet in the 1980s ) , happy days ( the fonz and the happy days gang ) , laverne & shirley ( laverne & shirley in the army ) , mork & mindy ( mork & mindy/laverne & shirley/fonz hour ) , the partridge family ( partridge family 2200 a.d by late 2008 , most shows that were part of the abc kids block ( except for power rangers ) were reruns of older episodes that originally aired a few years earlier ; this remained the case for the next three years , with no episodes added into rotation ( thus , for instance , the first season of hannah montana was still running on abc kids in constant repeats , even though several further seasons had aired on disney channel by the time the block ended ) as the popularity of these blocks continued to decline and no hit shows emerged from them , by the early 2010s cartoons began an outright phaseout , with the major networks opting to fill their educational mandates by commissioning live-action , mostly documentary/human interest series that were far less labor-intensive and expensive to produce ( and , more importantly for the networks , less restrictive in regard to commercials ) in 2003 , dic entertainment launched a syndicated children 's programming block titled the dic kids network ( branded as the incredible world of dic on-screen ) , which aired select animated series from the dic entertainment catalog ( and later some third-party programming ) on fox , upn and the wb ( later the cw and mynetworktv ) affiliated stations , alongside independent station to allow these stations to meet required e/i programming quotas the decline of saturday-morning cartoons coincided with a rise in adult animation and a wave of new , creator-driven animation studios , which experienced a revival ( much of it on prime time television ) in the 1990s as the saturday-morning cartoons were in decline , as did animated feature films ( see , for example , the disney renaissance ) in 2004 , abc was the last of the broadcast networks to add a saturday-morning edition of its morning news program ( in their case , good morning america ) in the first hour of its lineup , mainly due to internal affiliate criticism of the lack of network coverage for the february 2003 space shuttle columbia disaster which occurred on a saturday morning , forcing them to take coverage from other video news agency during the 1960s and 1970s , it was not uncommon to have animated shorts produced with both film and television in mind ( depatie-freleng was particularly associated with this business model ) , so that by selling the shorts to theaters , the studios could afford a higher budget than would otherwise be available from television alone , which at the time was still a free medium for the end-user kids ' wb , now reduced to just the saturday-morning block that was expanded to five hours from four with the removal of the weekday afternoon lineup , moved to the cw ( which is part-owned by the wb 's former parent warnermedia ) on september 23 , 2006 ( cw owned-and-operated station wupa in atlanta debuted the block the following day , as it opted to carry the block on sundays ) hub network owned the broadcast rights to rerun several of fox kids ' most popular programs ( this was a byproduct of former fox kids head margaret loesch working as head of the hub network at the time ) ; the majority of that programming was dropped or relegated to early morning time slots when loesch left the network and the channel was relaunched as discovery family in 2014 although the saturday-morning timeslot had always featured a great deal of children 's television series beginning in the early 1950s , the idea of commissioning new animated series for broadcast on saturday mornings caught on in the mid-1960s , when the networks realized that they could concentrate kids ' viewing on that one morning to appeal to advertising the decline of the timeslot somewhat began in the early 1990s for a variety of reasons , including : creative declines and stagnation at the major television animation studios ; by the late 1980s , major saturday-morning producers such as hanna-barbera and filmation had already recycled a limited number of common tropes and poorly developed stock characters numerous times over the previous two decades among its notable series included animated series such as taz-mania , batman : the animated series , x-men ( 1992 tv series ) , eek ! the cat , bobby 's world , spider-man : the animated series , and animaniacs , live action shows like power rangers ( the american adaptation of super sentai ) , goosebumps , and big bad beetleborgs , and japanese anime series such as digimon and transformers : robots in disguise filmation , primarily a cartoon producer , also turned out several live-action saturday-morning series in the 1970s , including shazam ! ( with animated sequences ) and the secret of isis , jason of star command , the ghost busters ( not related to the ghostbusters , but a vehicle for former f troop stars larry storch and forrest tucker ) and uncle croc 's block while production times and costs were undeniably higher with animated programming , the cost of talent was far less ( voice actors became known for their ability to hold several characters at once , sometimes even on the same show ) and networks could rerun children 's animated programming more frequently than most live-action series , negating the financial disadvantages in the 2010s , the channel 's focus shifted toward airing reruns of cancelled animated series from the 1990s and 2000s ( many of which were never intended for the saturday-morning programming block ) , and as of 2014 , all earlier cartoons are relegated to graveyard slots cartoons returned to the network in the fall of 2002 , after cable network discovery kids ( now discovery family ) won the rights to the timeslot in an auction , beating out other children 's television companies ( notably nickelodeon , which already programmed cbs 's saturday-morning block as nickelodeon on cbs ) the ties between the animated spin-offs and their live-action origins varied widely , depending on how much input the original cast and crew were willing to contribute ( and how much the animation companies were willing to pay for that talent ) ; in retrospect , animated versions of tv series are generally not treated as canon the network continues to offer saturday-morning programming as of 2015 , though as with most pbs programming , local member stations retain the right to refuse it outright for other programming such as instructional/diy/cooking programming , carrying it on sundays instead , or placing it on a subchannel telexitos airs both cartoons and three-hour children 's programming ; however , only two non-regulations on children 's television programming in the united states programming airs in the early morning and afternoon hours such as he-man and the masters of the universe and she-ra : princess of power on february 24 , 2016 , nbc announced a new e/i block produced by litton entertainment , the more you know—a brand extension of nbc 's public service announcement brand '' the more you know '' , and it launched on october 8 , 2016 , resulting in nbc removing all cartoons from its saturday-morning lineups for the first time since september 1992 fueled by the continued requirement for educational programming , networks continued to carry some cartoons well into the 2000s ; by this point , these consisted either of re-purposed rerun from cable or outsourced blocks of cartoons imported from outside the united states the kids ' wb block ended its run on may 17 , 2008 , and was replaced on may 24 , 2008 by the 4kids entertainment-produced toonzai ( 4kids already produced fox 's 4kids tv block at that time , which would not end for another seven months due to a dispute with the network over distribution on fox stations and compensation for the time lease ) ) most of the genres made popular in previous generations ( funny animals , superheroes , teen mysteries , science fiction and live-action adaptations ) continued to appear as well , with the exception of the musical band cartoons ( only one of note , the syndicated jem , emerged in the 1980s ) during the run of the weekday morning blocks , the network aired the animated series histeria ! to meet regulations on children 's television programming in the united states content quotas for the network 's affiliates boomerang , a spin-off channel of cartoon network , specialized primarily in rerun of saturday-morning cartoons from the 1960s and 1970s ( the majority of which come from hanna-barbera , which , like boomerang , is owned by warnermedia ) cookie jar toons/this is for kids was discontinued on october 31 , 2013 , effectively removing saturday children 's programming from the network ; after tribune broadcasting assumed part-ownership of thistv from weigel broadcasting the following day , tribune replaced the block with a three-hour sunday morning lineup of exclusively e/i-compliant programs from various syndication distributors the mid-1960s brought a boom in superhero cartoon series , some adapted from comic book , ( superman , aquaman , spider-man , fantastic four ) , and others original ( space ghost , the herculoids , birdman and the galaxy trio , etc the cw4kids was renamed toonzai on august 14 , 2010 ( with the former brand being retained as a sub-brand to fulfill branding requirements imposed by 4kids ) , toonzai was replaced by vortexx , produced under a time lease agreement with saban capital group ( which had acquired some of 4kids ' assets , including certain programs , in an auction earlier in the year ) on august 25 , 2012
