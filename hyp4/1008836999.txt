'' moss 2004:33 the terms birding and birdwatching are today used by some interchangeably , although some participants prefer birding , partly because it includes the auditory aspects of enjoying birds at the most basic level , the distinction is perceived as one of dedication or intensity , though this is a subjective differentiation generally , self-described birders perceive themselves to be more versed in minutiae like identification ( aural and visual ) , molt , distribution , migration timing , and habitat usage whereas these dedicated birders may often travel specifically in search of birds , birdwatchers have been described by some enthusiasts as having a more limited scope , perhaps not venturing far from their own yards or local parks to view birds indeed , in 1969 a birding glossary appeared in birding magazine which gave the following definitions : twitching is a british term used to mean '' the pursuit of a previously located rare bird the term twitcher , sometimes misapplied as a synonym for birder , is reserved for those who travel long distances to see a rare bird that would then be ticked , or counted on a list many birders maintain a life list , that is , a list of all of the species they have seen in their life , usually with details about the sighting such as date and location the american birding association has specific rules about how a bird species may be documented and recorded in such a list if it is submitted to the aba ; however , the criteria for the personal recording of these lists are very subjective the early interest in observing birds for their aesthetic rather than utilitarian ( mainly food ) value is traced to the late 18th century in the works of gilbert white , thomas bewick , george montagu and john clare moss 2004:10 the study of birds and natural history in general became increasingly prevalent in britain during the victorian era , often associated with collection , eggs and later skins being the artifacts of interest moss 2004:72 the phrase '' bird watching '' appeared for the first time as the title of a book '' bird watching '' by edmund selous in 1901 the organization and networking of those interested in birds began through organizations like the audubon society that was against the killing of birds and the american ornithologists ' union ( aou ) the bto saw the potential to produce scientific results through the networks , unlike the royal society for the protection of birds ( rspb ) which like the audubon society originated from the bird protection movement the need for global guides to birds became more relevant and one of the biggest projects that began was the handbook of the birds of the world which started in the 1990s with josep del hoyo , a country doctor in catalonia , jordi sargatal , and ornithologist andy elliott since the second half of the 20th century an increasing number of people in developing countries have engaged in this activity , such as in the degua tembien district of ethiopia transnational birding has played an important role in this , as birders in developing countries usually take up the pastime under the influence of foreign cultures with a history of birding fish and wildlife service study , birders contributed 36 billion to the us economy in 2006 , and one fifth ( 20 % ) of all americans are identified as birdwatchers one of the expectations of ecotourism is that the travels of birders to a place will contribute to the improvement of the local economy which and in turn ensure that the environment is valued and protected the most active times of the year for birding in temperate zones are during the spring or fall migrations when the greatest variety of birds may be seen seawatching , or pelagic birding , is a type of birding where observers based at a coastal watch point , such as a headland , watch birds flying over the sea this is one form of pelagic birding , by which pelagic bird species are viewed this kind of citizen science can assist in identifying environmental threats to the well-being of birds or , conversely , in assessing outcomes of environmental management initiatives intended to ensure the survival of at-risk species or encourage the breeding of species for aesthetic or ecological reasons this more scientific side of the hobby is an aspect of ornithology , coordinated in the uk by the british trust for ornithology prominent national and continental organizations concerned with birding include the british trust for ornithology and royal society for the protection of birds in the united kingdom , and the american birding association and the cornell lab of ornithology in north america equipment commonly used for birding includes binoculars , a spotting scope with tripod , a smartphone , a notepad , and one or more field guides it is now possible to take a recording of every birdcall you are likely to encounter in a given area out into the field stored on a device that will slip into your pocket , and to retrieve calls for playback and comparison in any order you choose photography has always been a part of birding , but in the past the cost of cameras with super-telephoto lenses made this a minority , often semi-professional , interest the advent of affordable digital cameras , which can be used in conjunction with a spotting scope or binoculars ( using the technique of afocal photography , referred to by the neologism '' digiscoping '' or sometimes digibinning for binoculars ) , have made this a much more widespread aspect of the hobby as with the arrival of affordable digital cameras , the development of more compact and affordable camcorder has made them more attractive and accessible to the birding community the ability to easily capture and reproduce not only the visual characteristics of a bird , but also its patterns of movement and its sound , has wide applications for birders in the field moss 2004:267–275 with the advent of the world-wide web , birders have been using the internet to convey information ; this can be via mailing lists , forums , bulletin-boards , web-based databases and other media messages can range from the serious to trivial , notifying others of rarities , questioning the taxonomy or identification of a species , discussing field guides and other resources , asking for advice and guidance , or organizing groups to help save habitats one of the oldest , birdchat ( based in the us ) probably has the most subscribers , followed by the english-language fork of eurobirdnet , birding-aus from australia , sabirdnet from south africa and orientalbirding as the numbers of birdwatchers increases , there is growing concern about the impact of birdwatching on the birds and their habitat some examples of birdwatching etiquette include promoting the welfare of birds and their environment , limiting use of photography , pishing and playback devices to mitigate stress caused to birds , maintaining a distance away from nests and nesting colonies , and respecting private property a study of the motivations for birdwatching in new york concluded that initial motivations were largely similar in males and females , but males who participate actively in birding are more motivated by '' sharing knowledge '' with others , and active female birders are more motivated by their '' intellectual '' interest in studying birds , and by the '' challenge '' of identifying new and rare birds and improving their skills all about birds – cornell lab of ornithology the bird wide web – non-commercial review site of online birding resources birders , banders , & binoculars video produced by idaho public television a six-part history of birding magazine , covering the period 1968–2006 , appeared in birding magazine in 2006 : 1968–1974 , 1975–1980 , 1981–1887 , 1988–1993 , 1994–2000 , 2001–2006
