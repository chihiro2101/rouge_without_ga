the term was coined by nobuyuki takahashi of studio hard after he attended the 42nd world science fiction convention ( worldcon ) in los angeles and saw costumed fans , which he later wrote about in an article for the japanese magazine my anime takahashi decided to coin a new word rather than use the existing translation of the english term '' masquerade '' because that translates into japanese as '' an aristocratic costume '' , which did not match his experience of the worldcon costuming guides of the period , such as samuel miller 's male character costumes ( 1884 ) or ardern holt 's fancy dresses described ( 1887 ) , feature mostly generic costumes , whether that be period costumes , national costumes , objects or abstract concepts such as '' autumn '' or '' night '' they attended the 1939 1st world science fiction convention ( nycon or 1st worldcon ) in the caravan hall , new york , usa dressed in '' futuristicostumes '' , including green cape and breeches , based on the pulp magazine artwork of frank r in japan , costuming at conventions was a fan activity from at least the 1970s , especially after the launch of the comiket convention in december 1975 the first documented case of costuming at a fan event in japan was at ashinocon ( 1978 ) , in hakone , at which future science fiction critic mari kotani wore a costume based on the cover art for edgar rice burroughs ' novel a fighting man of mars mari kotani 's costume has sometimes been misreported as a triton costume ( from the manga triton of the sea ) due to its visual similarity and because kotani was known as a member of the triton fan club in an interview kotani states that there were about twenty costumed attendees at the convention 's costume party—made up of members of her triton of the sea fan club and , antecedent of the gainax anime studio—with most attendees in ordinary clothing '' photographer dan golden saw a photograph of stevens in the vampirella costume while visiting ackerman 's house , leading to him hiring her for a non-speaking role in her first student film , zyzak is king ( 1980 ) , and later photographing her for the cover of the first issue of femme fatales ( 1992 ) as early as a year after the 1975 release of the rocky horror picture show , audience members began dressing as characters from the movie and role-playing ( although the initial incentive for dressing-up was free admission ) in often highly accurate costumes cosplay is the practice of dressing up as a character from a movie , book , or video game , especially one from the japanese genres of manga and anime he was impressed with the masquerade and reported on it in my anime , coining the term kosupure ( from which cosplay is derived ) in the process the term '' cosplay '' was coined in japan in 1984 , meaning '' costume '' and '' play '' it was inspired by and grew out of the practice of fan costuming at science fiction conventions , beginning with morojo 's '' '' futuristicostumes '' created for the 1st world science fiction convention in new york city in 1939 as stated above , costuming had been a fan activity in japan from the 1970s , and it became much more popular in the wake of takahashi 's report it was in the 1990s , after exposure on television and in magazines , that the term and practice of cosplaying became common knowledge in japan the first world cosplay summit was held on october 12 , 2003 at the rose court hotel in nagoya , japan , with five cosplayers invited from germany , france and italy it is generally considered different from halloween and mardi gras costume wear , as the intention is to replicate a specific character , rather than to reflect the culture and symbolism of a holiday event as such , when in costume , some cosplayers often seek to adopt the affect , mannerisms , and body language of the characters they portray ( with '' out of character '' breaks ) the characters chosen to be cosplayed may be sourced from any movie , tv series , book , comic book , video game , music band , anime , or manga , a steampunk version of a character ) , and it is a part of the ethos of cosplay that anybody can be anything , as with genderbending , crossplay , or drag , a cosplayer playing a character of another ethnicity , or a hijabi portraying captain america other cosplayers , who prefer to create their own costumes , still provide a market for individual elements , and various raw materials , such as unstyled wigs , hair dye , cloth and sewing notions , liquid latex , body paint , costume jewelry , and prop weapons the accuracy of a cosplay is judged based on the ability to accurately represent a character through the body , and individual cosplayers frequently are faced by their own '' bodily limits '' such as level of attractiveness , body size , and disability that often restrict and confine how accurate the cosplay is perceived to be some have argued that cosplay can never be a true representation of the character ; instead , it can only be read through the body , and that true embodiment of a character is judged based on nearness to the original character form in the creation of the outfits , much time is given to detail and qualities , thus the skill of a cosplayer may be measured by how difficult the details of the outfit are and how well they have been replicated because of the difficulty of replicating some details and materials , cosplayers often educate themselves in crafting specialties such as textiles , sculpture , face paint , fiberglass , fashion design , woodworking , and other uses of materials in the effort to render the look and texture of a costume accurately some anime and video game characters have weapons or other accessories that are hard to replicate , and conventions have strict rules regarding those weapons , but most cosplayers engage in some combination of methods to obtain all the items necessary for their costumes ; for example , they may commission a prop weapon , sew their own clothing , buy character jewelry from a cosplay accessory manufacturer , or buy a pair of off-the-rack shoes , and modify them to match the desired look multiple conventions dedicated to anime and manga , comics , tv shows , video games , science fiction , and fantasy may be found all around the world in north america , the highest-attended fan conventions featuring cosplayers are the san diego comic-con and new york comic con held in the united states , and the anime-specific anime north in toronto , otakon held in baltimore md and anime expo held in los angeles the areas are set up by not for profit associations of fans , but in some major fairs it is possible to visit areas set up directly by the developers of the video games or the producers of the anime as the popularity of cosplay has grown , many conventions have come to feature a contest surrounding cosplay that may be the main feature of the convention
