dvorak , '' why wikipedia just gets better '' pc magazine ( february 1 , 2008 ) : : you do n't think i 'm here as a wikipedia booster without some deeper commentary , do you ? there has to be something wrong with it , since the idea is utopian , and utopian ideas are bound to fail in the long term because its entries can be edited by anyone , the wikipedia can be the source of dubious or biased information : so is it to be trusted ? does it have the credibility of britannica ? well , i have monitored over a decent period a number of entries on matters about which i know something and have found them almost invariably accurate nor will you find it in any of the half a dozen or so mainstream encyclopedias currently on the market '' open source '' , the economist print edition , ( june 10th 2004 ) : wikipedia and the typos and awkward constructions we found ? as editors , we plan to return to those pages , on the subjects we care about , and tweak them a bit 30 , 2003 ) : : the wikipedia is perhaps one of the greatest testaments to the generosity on the web john jerney , '' the wikipedia : the encyclopedia for the rest of us '' , the daily yomiuri ( oct 22 , 2002 ) : : in particular , the goal of the wikipedia is to produce the best encyclopedia encapsulating the sum total of human knowledge the wikipedia , and hopefully other services similar to it , offers the possibility of everything being written into history , with all of mankind sharing knowledge and information in a way that enables everyone to profit from it 15 , 2002 ) : : what about authority and reliability and all the other things we 've been taught to look for in an encyclopedia ? we were prepared to hate wikipedia , but were disarmed when we got to the section wikipedia : our replies to our critics , which answered all these questions and more bad content will be edited out , and good content will rise to the top , like cream : as further edits accumulate , the quality of the article moves asymptomatically towards perfection , and likewise the quality of the encyclopedia as a whole with a total of 16,000 articles in the database , the wikipedia is already large enough to be a source of generally reliable information , though stronger in some areas ( '' star trek '' spinoffs ) than others ( the charles_dickens works ) to combat the problem of '' fake news '' on its site , facebook announced in 2018 that it is using wikipedia as a tool 31 , 2004 ) : : maybe the wikipedia is a short-lived fad , maybe it ’ ll get better , maybe it ’ ll get worse , but i was surprised that nobody pointed this out : the wikipedia is beautiful this killer app called , email , everyone around me has been chattering about for 17 years , does n't provide me incentive to learn a very simple interface , how the hell could a usenet group ? the killer app called wiki wiki has caused me to learn a mark up language , learn to keyboard , learn to compose text while touch typing and learn npov cold thank heavens you 're all out there ! user : aarchiba on user talk : aarchiba : : i must say , wikipedia has made tremendous progress since i last fiddled with it ; it 's astonishingly compendious , and the quality is just amazing musichastherighttochildren on wikipedia : village pump : i am a newcomer to wikipedia ; although i have been aware of it and used it on occasion for quite a while , i have only recently realised the depth of this resource , and discovered the mechanics behind it : this project is fantastic ! the number of articles and the amount of information in them is truly amazing , even articles on topics so obscure i thought there would be no chance they would exist : also , the articles are articulately written and unbiased , and the links between articles are very well done ( though perhaps i have whiled away too many hours in school reading article after article as a consequence of this ) wikipedia has become the primary internet resource for me ( with the possible exception of news websites ) , and i really think that it is a credit to everyone who works on it , and indeed to human nature itself ! this may seem like a sweeping statement , but it is hard to believe that something so incredible could be produced entirely voluntarily by people in their spare time
