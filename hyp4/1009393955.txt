these paradigms set the ways of approaching linguistic anthropology : the first , now known as '' anthropological linguistics '' , focuses on the documentation of languages ; the second , known as '' linguistic anthropology '' , engages in theoretical studies of language use ; the third , developed over the past two or three decades , studies issues from other sub-fields of anthropology with linguistic tactics addressing the broad central concerns of the subfield and drawing from its core theories , many scholars focus on the intersections of language and the particularly salient social constructs of race ( and ethnicity ) , class , and gender ( and sexuality ) he explored how the use of two languages with and around children in gapun village : the traditional language ( taiap ) , not spoken anywhere but in their own village and thus primordially '' indexical '' of gapuner identity , and tok pisin , the widely circulating official language of new guinea ochs and schieffelin demonstrated that baby talk is not universal , that the direction of adaptation ( whether the child is made to adapt to the ongoing situation of speech around it or vice versa ) was a variable that correlated , for example , with the direction it was held vis-à-vis a caregiver 's body in a series of studies , linguistic anthropologists elinor ochs and bambi schieffelin addressed the anthropological topic of socialization ( the process by which infants , children , and foreigners become members of a community , learning to participate in its culture ) , using linguistic and other ethnographic methods before that , indonesianist joseph errington , making use of earlier work by indonesianists not necessarily concerned with language issues per se , brought linguistic anthropological methods ( and semiotic theory ) to bear on the notion of the exemplary center , the center of political and ritual power from which emanated exemplary behavior while the field of linguistics has also been focused on the study of the linguistic structures of endangered languages , anthropologists also contribute to this field through their emphasize on ethnography understandings of the socio-historical context of language endangerment , but also of language revitalization and reclamation projects . contemporary linguistic anthropology continues research in all three of the paradigms described above : documentation of languages , study of language through context , and study of identity through linguistic means '' although this is arguably a fledgling line of language ideology research , this work is poised to contribute to the understanding of how ideologies of language operate in a variety of settings current approaches to such classic anthropological topics as ritual by linguistic anthropologists emphasize not static linguistic structures but the unfolding in realtime of a hypertrophic ' set of parallel orders of iconicity and indexicality that seem to cause the ritual to create its own sacred space through what appears , often , to be the magic of textual and nontextual metricalizations , synchronized encouraging those who already know the language to use it , increasing the domains of usage , and increasing the overall prestige of the language are all components of reclamation guardado goes on to argue that ideologies of heritage languages also contain the expectations and desires of linguistic minority families '' regarding the relevance of these languages in their children ’ s lives as well as when , where , how , and to what ends these languages should be used within such large-scale , macrosocial orders , in-effect ritual centers of semiosis come to exert a structuring , value-conferring influence on any particular event of discursive interaction with respect to the meanings and significance of the verbal and other semiotic forms used in it in a third example of the current ( third ) paradigm , since roman jakobson 's student michael silverstein opened the way , there has been an increase in the work done by linguistic anthropologists on the major anthropological theme of ideologies , silverstein , michael ochs and schieffelin uncovered how , through naturally occurring stories told during dinners in white middle class households in southern california , both mothers and fathers participated in replicating patriarchy ( the '' father knows best '' syndrome ) by the distribution of participant roles such as protagonist ( often a child but sometimes mother and almost never the father ) and '' problematizer '' ( often the father , who raised uncomfortable questions or challenged the competence of the protagonist ) the term linguistic anthropology reflected hymes ' vision for the future , where language would be studied in the context of the situation , and relative to the community speaking it the rhizome of blackness : a critical ethnography of hip-hop culture , language , identity , and the politics of becoming specifically , applied linguist martin guardado has posited that heritage language ideologies are '' somewhat fluid sets of understandings , justifications , beliefs , and judgments that linguistic minorities hold about their languages to speak tok pisin is to index a modern , christian ( catholic ) identity , based not on hed but on save , an identity linked with the will and the skill to cooperate language reclamation , as a subset of revitalization , implies that a language has been taken away from a community and addresses their concern in taking back the agency to revitalize their language on their own terms themes include : investigations of personal and social identities shared ideology construction of narrative interactions among individuals furthermore , like how the second paradigm made use of new technology in its studies , the third paradigm heavily includes use of video documentation to support research the field is devoted to themes unique to the sub-discipline : documentation of languages that were then seen as doomed to extinction , with special focus on the languages of native north american tribes woolard , in her overview of '' code-switching '' , or the systematic practice of alternating linguistic varieties within a conversation or even a single utterance , finds the underlying question anthropologists ask of the practice—why do they do that ? —reflects a dominant linguistic ideology much research on linguistic ideologies probes subtler influences on language , such as the pull exerted on tewa , a kiowa-tanoan language spoken in certain new mexican pueblos and on the hopi reservation in arizona , by '' kiva speech '' , discussed in the next section language and the culture of gender : at the intersection of structure , usage , and ideology british linguist david crystal has contributed to investigations of language death attention to the effects of cultural assimilation resulting in the spread of one dominant language in situations of colonialism the third paradigm , the study of anthropological issues , is a particularly rich area of study for current linguistic anthropologists they discovered that the processes of enculturation and socialization do not occur apart from the process of language acquisition , but that children acquire language and culture together in what amounts to an integrated process and , even though it pertains to tewa indians in arizona rather than indonesians , paul kroskrity 's argument that speech forms originating in the tewa kiva ( or underground ceremonial space ) forms the dominant model for all tewa speech can be seen as a direct parallel franz boas was one of the first anthropologists involved in language documentation within north america and he supported the development of three key materials : 1 ) grammars , 2 ) texts , and 3 ) dictionaries the travesti community , the argument goes , ends up at least making a powerful attempt to transcend the shame the larger brazilian public might try to foist off on them , again by loud public discourse and other modes of performance errington demonstrated how the javanese priyayi , whose ancestors served at the javanese royal courts , became emissaries , so to speak , long after those courts had ceased to exist , representing throughout java the highest example of '' refined speech linguistic anthropologist don kulick has done so in relation to identity , for example , in a series of settings , first in a village called gapun in northern papua new guinea to speak the taiap language is associated with one identity : not only local but '' backward '' and also an identity based on the display of hed ( personal autonomy ) silverstein has demonstrated that these ideologies are not mere false consciousness but actually influence the evolution of linguistic structures , including the dropping of '' thee '' and '' thou '' from everyday english usage the second paradigm can be marked by the switch from anthropological linguistics to linguistic anthropology , signalling a more anthropological focus on the study in a final example of this third paradigm , a group of linguistic anthropologists have done very creative work on the idea of social space and they have struggled with and largely resisted those parts of the bible that speak of being able to know the inner states of others ( e.g , ideologies and institutions ) related to race , class , and gender ( e.g looking like a language , sounding like a race : raciolinguistic ideologies and the learning of latinidad ochs and schieffelin demonstrated that members of all societies socialize children both to and through the use of language however , hymes ' ambition backfired as the second paradigm marked a distancing of the sub-discipline from the rest of anthropology he feels , in fact , that the exemplary center idea is one of linguistic anthropology 's three most important findings more recently , a new line of ideology work is beginning to enter the field of linguistics in relation to heritage language other linguists have carried out research in the areas of language contact , language endangerment , and 'english as a global language ' language revitalization is the practice of bringing a language back into common use unlike the first paradigm , which focused on linguistic tools like measuring of phonemes and morphemes , the second paradigm 's unit of analysis was the '' speech event ''
