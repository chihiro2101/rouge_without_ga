vicious was born simon john ritchie ( often erroneously reported as '' john simon ritchie '' ) on 10 may 1957 in lewisham , to john and anne ritchie ( 1933-1996 ) his mother dropped out of school early due to a lack of academic success and joined the british army , where she met her husband-to-be , john 's father , a guardsman at buckingham palace and a semi-professional trombone player on the london jazz scene john lydon nicknamed ritchie '' sid vicious '' after lydon 's pet hamster sid ( which was named after syd barrett ) , who had bitten ritchie , eliciting ritchie 's response : '' sid is really vicious ! '' the animal was described by lydon as '' the softest , furriest , weediest thing on earth '' at the time , ritchie was squatting with lydon , john joseph wardle ( jah wobble ) , and john grey , and the four were familiarly known as '' the four johns '' vicious began his musical career in 1976 as a member of the flowers of romance along with co-founding member of the clash keith levene ( who later co-founded john lydon 's post-pistols project public image limited ; their 1981 album was titled after the band ) and palmolive and viv albertine , who would later join the slits according to members of the damned , vicious was considered , along with dave vanian , for the position of lead singer for the damned , but vicious failed to show up for the audition during the damned 's performance at day 2 of the 100 club punk special , the day after making his debut drumming with siouxsie and the banshees , an intoxicated and amphetamine-fuelled vicious hurled his glass at the stage vicious was in the band , but he could not play well and had no bass guitar experience , so guitarist steve jones played bass on the band 's debut album never mind the bollocks , here 's the sex pistols.vicious appeared only on '' bodies '' , which he was allowed to play bass on , even though it would be overdubbed later on by jones he was also absent from the album 's sessions , because he was in the hospital with hepatitis ( most likely from his drug use ) and during that period his main visitor would have been his girlfriend nancy spungen , an american groupie ( and friend of johnny thunders ' ) he had met in 1977 john lydon claimed in the documentary never mind the baubles that vicious needed a serious talking-to beforehand because he wanted to be the '' hardcore , tough rocker bloke '' and that swearing and being tough was n't '' the right way '' to '' get the message across '' to the children the recording of the johnny thunders song '' born to lose '' which appears on sid sings , featuring vicious on vocals , was recorded during this performance , when johnny rotten stepped offstage to pose as father christmas these issues primarily involved tension between malcolm mclaren , johnny rotten and vicious , with rotten accusing mclaren of trying to '' wreck the very thing that made the sex pistols great , '' and the issue of vicious 's worsening heroin habit and negative interactions with members of the audience before the sex pistols took the stage of the longhorn ballroom in dallas , vicious , again in heroin withdrawal , carved the words '' gim me a fix '' into his bare chest with a razor he embarked on a path to destruction , while recording lead vocals on three cover songs for soundtrack album and film the great rock ' n ' roll swindle '' my way '' was released in 1978 , '' c'mon everybody '' was released in 1979 , and '' something else '' was released in 1979 after his death with spungen acting as his '' manager , '' vicious embarked on a solo career during which he performed with musicians including mick jones of the clash , sex pistols bassist glen matlock , rat scabies of the damned and the new york dolls ' arthur kane , jerry nolan , and johnny thunders on the morning of 12 october 1978 , vicious claimed to have awoken from a drugged stupor to find nancy spungen dead on the bathroom floor of their room in the hotel chelsea in manhattan , new york he said they had fought that night but gave conflicting versions of what happened next , saying , '' i stabbed her , but i never meant to kill her , '' then saying that he did not remember , and at one point during the argument spungen had fallen onto the knife on the evening of 1 february 1979 , a small group of friends , including jerry only of the misfits and future d generation founding member howie pyro , gathered at the manhattan apartment of vicious 's new girlfriend , michele robison , at 63 bank st polk said that despite spungen 's mother 's refusal , jerry only drove beverley and her sister , and two of vicious ' friends to the cemetery where spungen was buried , where beverley scattered vicious ' ashes over spungen 's grave during an interview for guitar hero iii , when jones was asked why he , instead of vicious , recorded the bass parts of never mind the bollocks , jones responded , '' sid was in a hospital with hepatitis , so he could n't really play , not that he could play anyway '' according to paul cook , in the few months between joining the band and meeting spungen , vicious was a dedicated worker and tried his hardest to learn to play ; indeed , this period was cook 's favourite in the band the filth and the fury , julien temple , 2000 ; '' the best time in the band of all was when sid first joined—he was really determined to learn the bass and fit in and be part of the band '' viv albertine went further in defence of his ability , saying that one night she '' went to bed , and sid stayed up with a ramones album and a bass guitar , and when i got up in the morning , he could play 194 keith levene , a member of the flowers of romance with vicious and later a member of the clash and then public image ltd , also recounts a similar story : '' could sid play bass ? i do n't know , but one thing i do know was that sid did things quickly sid sings ( 1979 ) uk : silver bpi the idols with sid vicious ( 1993 ) sid vicious & friends ( 1998 ) better ( 2001 ) live at max 's kansas city , ny 1978 ( 2002 ) at the electric ballroom ( 2003 ) too fast to live ( 2004 ) sid lives ( 2007 ) chaos and disorder tapes ( 2008 ) the great rock ' n ' roll swindle ( virgin , 1979 ) some product : carri on sex pistols ( virgin , 1979 ) flogging a dead horse ( virgin,1980 ) kiss this ( virgin , 1992 ) never mind the bollocks / spunk ( aka this is crap ) ( virgin , 1996 ) the filth and the fury ( virgin , 2000 ) jubilee ( virgin , 2002 ) sex pistols box set ( virgin , 2002 ) mike 's mondo video ( 1979 , directed by michael o'donoghue ) the punk rock movie ( 1979 , directed by don letts ) the great rock ' n ' roll swindle ( 1979 , directed by julien temple ) doa ( 1981 , directed by lech kowalski ) buried alive ( 1991 , sex pistols ) decade ( 1991 , sex pistols ) bollocks to every ( 1995 , sex pistols ) filth to fury ( 1995 , sex pistols ) classic chaotic ( 1996 , sex pistols ) kill the hippies ( 1996 , sex pistols , vhs ) the filth and the fury ( 2000 , directed by julien temple , vhs/ntsc/dvd ) live at the longhorn ( 2001 , sex pistols ) live at winterland ( 2001 , sex pistols , dvd ) 24 hour party people ( 2002 , directed by michael winterbottom ) mind the bollocks here 's the sex pistols ( 2002 , sex pistols , vhs/dvd ) punk rockers ( 2003 , sex pistols , dvd ) blood on the turntable : the sex pistols ( 2004 , directed by steve crabtree ) music box biographical collection ( 2005 , sex pistols , dvd ) punk icons ( 2006 , sex pistols , dvd ) american hardcore ( 2007 , dvd ) chaos ! ex pistols secret history : the dave goodman story ( 2007 , sex pistols , dvd ) pirates of destiny ( 2007 , directed by tõnu trubetsky , dvd ) rock case studies ( 2007 , sex pistols , dvd ) who killed nancy ?
