further empirical work has highlighted the impact transaction costs have on the concept of market efficiency , with much evidence suggesting that any anomalies pertaining to market inefficiencies are the result of a cost benefit analysis made by those willing to incur the cost of acquiring the valuable information in order to trade on it any test of this proposition faces the joint hypothesis problem , where it is impossible to ever test for market efficiency , since to do so requires the use of a measuring stick against which abnormal returns are compared —one can not know if the market is efficient if one does not know if a model correctly stipulates the required rate of return joel tillinghast , also a fund manager at fidelity with a long history of outperforming a benchmark , has written that the core arguments of the emh are '' more true than not '' and he accepts a '' sloppy '' version of the theory allowing for a margin of error market strategist jeremy grantham stated flatly that the emh was responsible for the current financial crisis , claiming that belief in the hypothesis caused financial leaders to have a '' chronic underestimation of the dangers of asset bubbles breaking '' while other assets used as currency ( such as gold , tobacco ) have value independent of people 's willingness to accept them as payment , quiggin argues that '' in the case of bitcoin there is no source of value whatsoever '' and thus should be priced at zero or worthless pilkington argues that introducing the idea that anyone who diverges from the theory is simply 'lucky ' insulates the theory from falsification and so , drawing on the philosopher of science and critic of neoclassical economics hans albert , pilkington argues that the theory falls back into being a tautology or a pseudoscientific construct '' others , such as fama , said that the hypothesis held up well during the crisis and that the markets were a casualty of the recession , not the cause of it columbia business school publishing but he also contends the emh is not completely accurate or accurate in all cases , given the recurrent existence of economic bubbles ( when some assets are dramatically overpriced ) and the fact that value investing ( who focus on underpriced assets ) have tended to outperform the broader market over long periods the financial crisis led richard posner , a prominent judge , university of chicago law professor , and innovator in the field of law and economics , to back away from the hypothesis while event studies of stock splits are consistent with the emh ( fama , fisher , jensen , and roll , 1969 ) , other empirical analyses have found problems with the efficient-market hypothesis but pilkington points out that when proponents of the theory are presented with evidence that a small minority of investors do , in fact , beat the market over the long-run , these proponents then say that these investors were simply 'lucky ' behavioral finance attribute the imperfections in financial markets to a combination of cognitive biases such as overconfidence , overreaction , representative bias , information bias , and various other predictable human errors in reasoning and information processing these risk factor models are not properly founded on economic theory ( whereas capm is founded on modern portfolio theory ) , but rather , constructed with long-short portfolios in response to the observed empirical emh anomalies noted financial journalist roger lowenstein blasted the theory , declaring '' the upside of the current great recession is that it could drive a stake through the heart of the academic nostrum known as the efficient-market hypothesis for instance , the '' small-minus-big '' ( smb ) factor in the ff3 factor model is simply a portfolio that holds long positions on small stocks and short positions on large stocks to mimic the risks small stocks face peter lynch , a mutual fund manager at fidelity investments who consistently more than doubled market averages while managing the magellan fund , has argued that the emh is contradictory to the random walk hypothesis—though both concepts are widely taught in business schools without seeming awareness of a contradiction tshilidzi marwala surmised that artificial intelligence influences the applicability of the theory of the efficient market hypothesis in that the more artificial intelligence infused computer traders there are in the markets as traders the more efficient the markets become in his book the reformation in economics , economist and financial analyst philip pilkington has argued that the emh is actually a tautology masquerading as a theory economist john quiggin has claimed that '' bitcoin is perhaps the finest example of a pure bubble '' , and that it provides a conclusive refutation of emh consequently , a situation arises where either the asset pricing model is incorrect or the market is inefficient , but one has no way of knowing which is the case if the price of the stock does not already reflect that information , then investors can trade on it , thereby moving the price until the information is no longer useful for trading nobel prize-winning economist paul samuelson argued that the stock market is '' micro efficient '' but not '' macro efficient '' : the emh is much better suited for individual stocks than it is for the aggregate stock market further tests of portfolio efficiency by gibbons , ross and shanken ( 1989 ) ( gjr ) led to rejections of the capm , although tests of efficiency inevitably run into the joint hypothesis problem ( see roll 's critique )
