if it might have some validity – the 21st album , lost cause , finished with a sidelong piece called '' the electric end '' , a crazed instrumental featuring shouted vocals , electric guitar , and microphone feedback '' then the 22nd album arrived and returned to the acoustic and vocal sound that is found on most of the first six corwood albums ( often referred to as '' the first acoustic phase
