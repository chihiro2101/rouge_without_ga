according to the white paper by the business rules group , business rules group , defining business rules ~ what are they really ? , a statement of a business rule falls into one of four categories : definitions of business terms the most basic element of a business rule is the language used to express it '' having business rules that are not known or shared across the organization , and if they are unwritten , can cause lack of communication across the board and inconsistency with production , processes , quality , and customer/employee experiences similar to how business risks can be structured as : if then a business rule can be structured as : when then otherwise however , since any if/then/else rule can be encoded as such , it is vaccuous to claim that this is especially a '' business rule '' allowing business rules to be documented during the course of business projects is less expensive and easier to accomplish than the first approach , but if the rules are not collected in a consistent manner , they are not valuable in order to meet the business 's goals , businesses can come up with their own business rules and self-impose them in order to meet their standards or if they are trying to comply to external standards there are several assertions to be kept in mind when one is trying to define types of business rules : a structural assertion is where facts are portrayed as the structure of an enterprise and are used to make decisions while newer software tools are able to combine business rule management and execution , it is important to realize that these two ideas are distinct , and each provides value that is different from the other this process is not difficult to learn , can be performed in real-time , and empowers business stakeholders to manage their own business rules in a consistent manner in addition , business projects , such as the launching of a new product or the re-engineering of a complex process , might lead to the definition of new business rules one of the pitfalls in trying to fill the gap between rules management and execution is trying to give business rules the syntax of logic , and merely describing logical constructs in a natural language this practice of incidental , or emergent , business rule gathering is vulnerable to the creation of inconsistent or even conflicting business rules within different organizational units , or within the same organizational unit over time
