salvatore gravano was born on march 12 , 1945 , in bensonhurst , brooklyn , new york to giorlando '' gerry '' and caterina '' kay '' gravano as a child , while his father had been on the crew of a freighter when he jumped ship in canada and entered the u.s his daughter karen gravano appeared on the vh1 reality series , mob wives beginning in 2011 , and released a book in 2013 titled mob daughter : the mafia , sammy '' the bull '' gravano , and me ! gravano 's rise was so precipitous that it was generally understood that he would be among the first to made man when the cosa nostra 's membership books were reopened ( they had been closed since 1957 ) gravano later became a mentor to colucci 's son , jack colucci , who became involved in the construction industry as a gambino associate in the early 1970s , colombo soldier ralph spero , brother of shorty , became envious of gravano 's success , fearing that he would become a made man before his son , tommy after ronga 's death , a rumor had spread that gravano had attempted to pick up ronga 's widow sybil davies at a bar , though gravano maintained that davies was the one hitting on him while shorty spero believed gravano rather than ralph , he and the colombo hierarchy decided that to avoid conflict , it was best for gravano to leave the colombo family and join the gambino crime family gravano 's construction and other business interests soon earned him a reputation as a '' good earner '' within the gambino organization and made him a multi-millionaire , enabling him to build a large estate for his family in rural ocean county , new jersey after befriending simone through a series of meetings , gravano , with the assistance of milito and d'angelo , abducted simone from yardley golf club in yardley , pennsylvania , ( part of suburban trenton , new jersey ) and drove him to a wooded area on staten island gravano then granted simone 's requests to die with his shoes off , in fulfillment of a promise he had made to his wife , and at the hands of a made man later that night , gravano confronted fiala on the street as he exited the plaza suite among a group of people , asking , '' hey , frank , how you doing ? '' as fiala turned around , surprised to see gravano , milito came up behind him and shot him in the head gravano , however , was spared execution when he convinced castellano that the reason he had kept him in the dark was to protect the boss in case something went wrong with the hit gambino underboss neil dellacroce intervened on gravano 's behalf and castellano told the two men to end their business partnership , though gravano 's standing with the boss slipped as a result of the incident dellacroce , however , was rising star john gotti 's mentor , and when word got back to him that dellacroce had supported gravano , gotti was impressed during this time , the fbi had intensified its efforts against the gambino family and in august 1983 , three members of gotti 's crew – angelo ruggiero , john carneglia , and gene gotti – were indicted for heroin trafficking the fbi had bugged ruggiero 's house and telephone , and castellano decided he needed copies of the tapes to justify his impending move to dellacroce and the family 's other capos when castellano was indicted for both his connection to roy demeo 's stolen car ring and as part of the mafia commission trial , he learned his own house had been bugged on the basis of evidence from the ruggiero tapes and he became livid in conversation with decicco , both men voiced concern that castellano would designate his nephew , thomas gambino , acting boss and his driver , thomas bilotti , underboss in the event he was convicted and sent to prison gravano 's second choice to become boss after castellano 's murder was frank decicco , but decicco felt john gotti 's ego was too big to take a subservient role decicco argued that gotti 's boldness , intelligence , and charisma made him well-suited to be '' a good boss '' and he convinced gravano to give gotti a chance decicco and gravano , however , also made a secret pact to kill gotti and take over the family as boss and underboss , respectively , if they were unhappy with gotti 's leadership after one year armone 's support was critical ; he was a respected old-timer in the family , and it was believed he could help win over castellano supporters to the new regime knowing it would be too risky to approach the other four bosses directly , the conspirators got the support of several important mobsters of their generation in the lucchese , colombo and bonanno families with neil dellacroce 's death on december 2 , 1985 , the final constraint on a move by gotti or castellano against the other was removed not suspecting the plot against him , castellano invited decicco to a meeting on december 16 , 1985 , with fellow capos thomas gambino , james failla , and danny marino at sparks steak house in manhattan after castellano 's death , gallo–the only surviving member of the hierarchy–convened a three-man committee to temporarily run the family , comprising himself , gotti and decicco however , it was an open secret that gotti was acting boss in all but name , and nearly all of the family 's capos knew he had been the one behind the hit gotti was formally acclaimed as the new boss of the gambino family at a meeting of 20 capos held on january 15 , 1986 gotti , in turn , selected decicco as his underboss and elevated gravano to capo after toddo aurello announced his desire to step down the bombing was carried out by victor amuso and anthony casso of the lucchese family , under orders of vincent gigante and lucchese boss anthony corallo , to avenge castellano and bilotti by killing their successors ; gotti also planned to visit failla that day , but canceled , and the bomb was detonated after a soldier who rode with decicco was mistaken for the boss 473–476 bombs had long been banned by the mafia out of concern that it would put innocent people in harm 's way , leading the gambinos to initially suspect that '' zips '' —sicily mafiosi working in the u.s.—were behind it ; zips were well known for using bombs he was forced to rely heavily on gravano , angelo ruggiero , and joseph armone to manage the family 's day-to-day affairs while he called the major shots from his jail cell in june , gravano was approached by ruggiero and , supposedly at gotti 's behest , given orders to murder capo robert dibernardo for making negative remarks about gotti 's leadership gravano arranged a meeting with dibernardo where joe paruta , a member of gravano 's crew , shot dibernardo twice in the back of the head as the underboss watched gravano later learned that ruggiero was 250,000 in debt to dibernardo and realized ruggiero may have fabricated the orders from gotti or simply lied to gotti about what dibernardo was accused of saying in order to erase the debt and improve his own standing in the family 159 with gotti standing trial alongside his brother gene '' willie boy '' johnson ( who , despite being exposed as an informant , refused to turn state 's evidence raab , p gallo was replaced with gravano as consigliere , and by 1990 , gravano was promoted to underboss to replace the acting frank locascio 195–196 by this time , gravano was regarded as a '' rising force '' in the construction industry and often mingled with executives from major construction firms and union officials at his popular bensonhurst restaurant , tali's gotti , gravano and locascio , were often recorded by the bugs placed throughout the ravenite ( concealed in the main room , the first-floor hallway and the upstairs apartment of the building ) discussing incriminating events gravano pleaded guilty to a superseding racketeering charge , and gotti charged with five murders ( castellano , bilotti , dibernardo , liborio milito and louis dibono ) , conspiracy to murder gaetano vastola , loansharking , illegal gambling , obstruction of justice , bribery and tax evasion at the same time , attorneys bruce cutler and gerald shargel were disqualified from defending gotti and gravano after prosecutors successfully contended they were '' part of the evidence '' and thus liable to be called as witnesses 400–401 the tapes also created a rift between gotti and gravano , where the gambino boss described his newly appointed underboss as too greedy and attempted to frame gravano as the main force behind the murders of dibernardo , milito and dibono 413 he was the first member of the hierarchy of a new york crime family to turn informer , and the second confessed underboss in the history of the american mafia to do so after the philadelphia crime family 's phil leonetti jury selection began in january 1992 with an anonymous jury and , for the first time in a brooklyn federal case , fully sequestered during the trial due to gotti 's reputation for jury tampering 422 prosecutors andrew maloney and john gleeson began their case by playing tapes showing gotti discussing gambino family business , including murders he approved , and confirming the animosity between gotti and castellano to establish the former 's motive to kill his boss 425–426 on the stand , gravano confirmed gotti 's place in the structure of the gambino family and described in detail the conspiracy to assassinate castellano , giving a full description of the hit and its aftermath however , since gravano had already served four years , the sentence amounted to less than one year in 1997 , gravano was consulted several times for the 1997 biographical book about his life , underboss by author peter maas during an interview gravano had with the newspaper the arizona republic , he claimed federal agents he had met after becoming a government witness had become his personal friends and even visited him in arizona while on vacation gravano later claimed that he did n't want the republic to publish the story , but relented after the paper allegedly threatened to reveal that his family was living with him in phoenix the fbi alleged that peter gotti ordered two gambino soldiers , thomas '' huck '' carbonaro and eddie garafola , to murder gravano in arizona in 1999 he partnered with a local youth gang known as the '' devil dogs '' after his son , gerard , became friends with the gang 's 23-year-old leader , michael papa in february 2000 , gravano and nearly 40 other ring members—including his ex-wife debra , daughter karen , and gerard—were arrested on federal and state drug charges gravano was implicated by informants in his own drug ring , as well as by recorded conversations in which he discussed drug profits with debra and karen on september 7 , 2002 , after numerous delays , gravano was sentenced in new york to 20 years in prison a month later , he was also sentenced in arizona to 19 years in prison to run concurrently gravano denied any involvement in calabro 's death and rejected a plea deal , under which he would have received no additional jail time if he confessed to the crime and implicated all his accomplices he was initially scheduled to be released in march 2019 , however , was released early on september 18 , 2017 documentary series from court tv ( now trutv ) '' mugshots : sammy '' the bull '' gravano '' episode ( 2003 ) at filmrise booknotes interview with maas
