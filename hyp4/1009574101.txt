the original business plan presented to investors in 1969 showed uses in transportation ( automotive vehicle identification , automatic toll system , electronic license plate , electronic manifest , vehicle routing , vehicle performance monitoring ) , banking ( electronic checkbook , electronic credit card ) , security ( personnel identification , automatic gates , surveillance ) and medical ( identification , patient history ) even though this device was a covert listening device , rather than an identification tag , it is considered to be a predecessor of rfid because it was passive , being energized and activated by waves from an outside source rfid tags are made out of three pieces : a micro chip ( an integrated circuit which stores and processes information and modulates and demodulates radio-frequency ( rf ) signals ) , an antenna for receiving and transmitting the signal and a substrate tags may either be read-only , having a factory-assigned serial number that is used as a key into a database , or may be read/write , where object-specific data can be written into the tag by the system user generally , an rfid tag has an inlay , composed of three components , namely silicon ( si ) chip , aca ( anisotropic conductive adhesive ) layer and flexible substrate ( al/pet ) , as shown in fig.1 ( a ) an early work exploring rfid is the landmark 1948 paper by harry stockman , who predicted that '' considerable research and development work has to be done before the remaining basic problems in reflected-power communication are solved , and before the field of useful applications is explored a variation of this system could also use a battery-assisted passive ( bap ) tag which acts like a passive tag but has a small battery to power the tag 's return reporting signal image : fastrak transponder.jpg right frame fastrak , an rfid tag used for electronic toll collection in california in 1945 , l√©on theremin invented a listening device for the soviet union which retransmitted incident radio waves with the added audio information a passive tag is cheaper and smaller because it has no battery ; instead , the tag uses the radio energy transmitted by the reader an active reader passive tag ( arpt ) system has an active reader , which transmits interrogator signals and also receives authentication replies from passive tags a passive reader active tag ( prat ) system has a passive reader which only receives radio signals from active tags ( battery operated , transmit only )
