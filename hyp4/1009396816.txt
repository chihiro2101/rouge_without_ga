the most famous of duchamp 's readymades was fountain ( 1917 ) , a standard urinal-basin signed by the artist with the pseudonym '' r.mutt '' , and submitted for inclusion in the annual , un-juried exhibition of the society of independent artists in new york ( which rejected it ) 28 the artistic tradition does not see a commonplace object ( such as a urinal ) as art because it is not made by an artist or with any intention of being art , nor is it unique or hand-crafted duchamp 's relevance and theoretical importance for future '' conceptualists '' was later acknowledged by us artist joseph kosuth in his 1969 essay , art after philosophy , when he wrote : '' all art ( after duchamp ) is conceptual ( in nature ) because art only exists conceptually '' in 1956 the founder of lettrism , isidore isou , developed the notion of a work of art which , by its very nature , could never be created in reality , but which could nevertheless provide aesthetic rewards by being contemplated intellectually henry flynt , '' the crystallization of concept art in 1961 '' therefore , flynt maintained , to merit the label concept art , a work had to be a critique of logic or mathematics in which a linguistic concept was the material , a quality which is absent from subsequent '' conceptual art the term assumed a different meaning when employed by joseph kosuth and by the english art and language group , who discarded the conventional art object in favour of a documented critical inquiry , that began in art-language the journal of conceptual art in 1969 , into the artist 's social , philosophical , and psychological status as it is of the nature of paintings to be flat objects with canvas surfaces onto which colored pigment is applied , such things as figuration , 3-d perspective illusion and references to external subject matter were all found to be extraneous to the essence of painting , and ought to be removed 11 some have argued that conceptual art continued this '' dematerialization '' of art by removing the need for objects altogether , lucy lippard & john chandler , '' the dematerialization of art '' , art international 12:2 , february 1968 however , by the end of the 1960s it was certainly clear that greenberg 's stipulations for art to continue within the confines of each medium and to exclude external subject matter no longer held traction 12 conceptual art also reacted against the commodification of art ; it attempted a subversion of the gallery or museum as the location and determiner of art , and the art market as the owner and distributor of art it is sometimes ( as in the work of robert barry , yoko ono , and weiner himself ) reduced to a set of written instructions describing a work , but stopping short of actually making it—emphasising the idea as more important than the artifact this reveals an explicit preference for the '' art '' side of the ostensible dichotomy between art and craft , where art , unlike craft , takes place within and engages historical discourse : for example , ono 's '' written instructions '' make more sense alongside other conceptual art of the time although the utilisation of text in art was in no way novel , only in the 1960s did the artists lawrence weiner , edward ruscha , joseph kosuth , robert barry , and art & language begin to produce art by exclusively linguistic means 76 the british philosopher and theorist of conceptual art peter osborne suggests that among the many factors that influenced the gravitation toward language-based art , a central role for conceptualism came from the turn to linguistic theories of meaning in both anglo-american analytic philosophy , and structuralism and post-structuralism continental philosophy during the middle of the twentieth century '' ascott , the british artist most closely associated with cybernetic art in england , was not included in cybernetic serendipity because his use of cybernetics was primarily conceptual and did not explicitly utilize technology conversely , although his essay on the application of cybernetics to art and art pedagogy , '' the construction of change '' ( 1964 ) , was quoted on the dedication page ( to sol lewitt ) of lucy r lippard 's seminal six years : the dematerialization of the art object from 1966 to 1972 , ascott 's anticipation of and contribution to the formation of conceptual art in britain has received scant recognition , perhaps ( and ironically ) because his work was too closely allied with art-and-technology another vital intersection was explored in ascott 's use of the thesaurus in 1963 which drew an explicit parallel between the taxonomic qualities of verbal and visual languages – a concept would be taken up in joseph kosuth 's second investigation , proposition 1 ( 1968 ) and mel ramsden 's elements of an incomplete map ( 1968 ) 1973 by adopting language as their exclusive medium , weiner , barry , wilson , kosuth and art & language were able to sweep aside the vestiges of authorial presence manifested by formal invention and the handling of materials although skill in the handling of traditional media often plays little role in conceptual art , it is difficult to argue that no skill is required to make conceptual works , or that skill is always absent from them the first wave of the '' conceptual art '' movement extended from approximately 1967 conceptual art – '' in 1967 , sol lewitt published paragraphs on conceptual art ( considered by many to be the movement 's manifesto ) early '' concept '' artists like henry flynt ( 1940– ) , robert morris ( 1931–2018 ) , and ray johnson ( 1927–1995 ) influenced the later , widely accepted movement of conceptual art conceptual artists like dan graham , hans haacke , and lawrence weiner have proven very influential on subsequent artists , and well-known contemporary artists such as mike kelley or tracey emin are sometimes labeled '' second- or third-generation '' conceptualists , or '' post-conceptual '' artists ( the prefix post- in art can frequently be interpreted as '' because of '' ) contemporary artists have taken up many of the concerns of the conceptual art movement , while they may or may not term themselves '' conceptual artists '' ideas such as anti-commodification , social and/or political critique , and ideas/information as medium continue to be aspects of contemporary art , especially among artists working with installation art , performance art , net.art and electronic/digital art palolem island , india , 2008 image : programmed machines installation
