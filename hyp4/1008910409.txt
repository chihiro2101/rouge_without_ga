in continental europe , races are conducted exclusively among trotters , whereas in australia , canada , new zealand , the united kingdom and the united states races are also held for pacers the sulky ( informally known as a '' bike '' , and also known as a spider ) is a light , two-wheeled cart equipped with bicycle wheels in australia and new zealand , harness racing is conducted both on smaller rural tracks and at major city venues , creating the opportunity for even the hobby-trainer to make it into the big-time if they have an exceptional horse another kind of start is a standing start , where there are tapes or imaginary lines across the track behind which the horses either stand stationary or trot in circles in pairs in a specific pattern to hit the starting line as a group in both new zealand and australia the same system of an 'open lane ' operates , although in australia it is called a 'sprint lane ' and in new zealand a 'passing lane ' the pace is a natural gait for many horses , and hobbles are an aid in supporting the gait at top speed ; trotting hobbles ( which employ a different design , due to the difference in the gait ) are becoming increasingly popular for the same reason other important annual races are svenskt travkriterium , a race restricted to three-year-olds , also hosted at solvalla and swedish trotting derby ( open for the best four-year-old horses ) hosted in september at jägersro in malmö pacing races constitute 80 % to 90 % of the harness races conducted in north america - while the clear majority of harness racing in australia and new zealand are also now for pacers , even though the sport is colloquially still known as 'the trots other important harness racing arenas in scandinavia are åby outside gothenburg , mantorp , axevalla , bergsåker , boden ( almost at the polar circle ) and charlottenlund in danish capital copenhagen this solves a common problem , in which trailing horses are '' boxed in '' ( behind the leader , with another horse outside ) in north america , harness races are restricted to standardbred horses , although european racehorses may also be french trotters or russian trotters , or have mixed ancestry with lineages from multiple breeds standardbreds are so named because in the early years of the standardbred stud book , only horses who could trot or pace a mile in a standard time ( or whose progeny could do so ) of no more than 2 minutes , 30 seconds were admitted to the book for exercising or training , the drivers use what is known as a '' jog cart , '' which is a sulky that is heavier and bulkier than a racing unit the leading harness racing nations in europe are france , italy and sweden , and the sport is fairly popular in most northern european countries the driver ( not a '' jockey '' , as in thoroughbred racing ) carries a light whip chiefly used to signal the horse by tapping and to make noise by striking the sulky shaft most races are run on tracks constructed solely for harness racing ( some with banked turns ) , but a few tracks conduct both harness and thoroughbred flat racing the start speed , acceleration , score up distance , and gate closing are controlled via a computer system , which takes control of the vehicle and provides a printout at the end of the score up many european – and some australian and new zealand – races use a standing start , although this increases the chance of a 'false start ' where one or a number of horses commence 'off-stride ' and gallop a very good horse in a race with weak opponents but with a bad start number ( like 12 or higher ) may not become the prime favorite due to the bad starting position , especially at short distance ' pacing horses are faster and ( most important to the bettor ) less likely to break stride ( a horse which starts to gallop must be slowed down and taken to the outside until it resumes trotting or pacing ) the horses are entered in the race based on life-time earnings , unless they have qualified by performing well in the preceding six qualifying races the most notable harness tracks in north america are the meadowlands racetrack in new jersey , yonkers raceway in yonkers , new york , the red mile in kentucky and mohawk raceway in ontario one single '' row '' is very cheap to play , but people usually play large systems , picking the winner in one or two of the races and several horses in the other races if the race leader is positioned on the rail at the top of the homestretch , that leader is required by rule to maintain that line ( or move further out ) , while horses behind the leader can move into the open lane with room to pass the leader if possible at longer races ( with rather even competitors ) running positions like second or third in the outer track have good chances , especially if the inner track horses get trapped behind a weakening front horse the winner of seven ( pre-decided ) races ( with 12 or 15 horses ) is to be picked älgen stolta canadian horse racing hall of fame chariot racing harness racing museum & hall of fame harness racing in australia harness racing in new zealand harness racing in sweden another large difference is that in australian racing the leader does not have to hand up the lead to any horse that challenges , often leaving a horse parked outside the leader in the '' death seat '' or simply '' the death '' ( known as '' facing the breeze '' in new zealand ) , as this horse covers more ground than the leader australian racing differs from north american racing in that metric distances are used , generally above the equivalent of one mile and horses are classed by how many wins they have north american harness horses earn a '' mark '' ( a record ) , which is their fastest winning time at that distance important canadian races include the gold cup and saucer at charlottetown driving park , north america cup ( for pacers ) , the canadian pacing derby , and the maple leaf trot on the rail behind the leader is a choice spot , known as the '' pocket '' , and a horse in that position is said to have a '' garden trip '' horses number 6 and 7 can both get a better speed at the starting line , and there are no horses in front of them due to the sulky width and the oval race track overtaking is a far more difficult manoeuver to achieve , in comparison with gallop racing at solvalla in the suburbs of stockholm the premier standardbred mile race is held in late may every year , elitloppet ( the elite race )
