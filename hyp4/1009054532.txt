the yogyakarta principles , a document on the application of international human rights law , provide in the preamble a definition of gender identity as each person 's deeply felt internal and individual experience of gender , which may or may not correspond with the sex assigned at birth , including the person 's sense of the body ( which may involve , if freely chosen , modification of bodily appearance or function by medical , surgical or other means ) and other experience of gender , including dress , speech and mannerism a study by reiner & gearhart provides some insight into what can happen when genetically male children with cloacal exstrophy are sexually assigned female and raised as girls , according to an 'optimal gender policy ' developed by john money : in a sample of 14 children , follow-up between the ages of 5 to 12 showed that 8 of them identified as boys , and all of the subjects had at least moderately male-typical attitudes and interests , providing support for the argument that genetic variables affect gender identity and behavior independent of socialization the volume of the central subdivision of the bed nucleus of a stria terminalis or bstc

gender variant , transgender , or genderqueer ( or non-binary ) ( there is an emerging vocabulary for those who defy traditional gender identity ) , and people who have such expressions may experience gender dysphoria ( traditionally called gender identity disorder or gid ) martin and ruble conceptualize this process of development as three stages : ( 1 ) as toddlers and preschoolers , children learn about defined characteristics , which are socialized aspects of gender ; ( 2 ) around the ages of 5–7 years , identity is consolidated and becomes rigid ; ( 3 ) after this '' peak of rigidity '' , fluidity returns and socially defined gender roles relax somewhat in the 1960s and 1970s , factors such as the absence of a father , a mother 's wish for a daughter , or parental reinforcement patterns were suggested as influences ; more recent theories suggesting that parental psychopathology might partly influence gender identity formation have received only minimal empirical evidence ,

the genitalia they were born with ( see transsexual for some of the possible reasons ) but adopt a gender role that is consistent with their gender identity gender dysphoria ( previously called ''

adolescents and adults ) according to freud , during this stage , children developed an oedipus complex where they had sexual fantasies for the parent ascribed the opposite gender and hatred for the parent ascribed the same gender , and this hatred transformed into ( unconscious ) transference and ( conscious ) identification with the hated parent who both exemplified a model to appease sexual impulses and threatened to castrate the child 's power to appease sexual impulses a 2005 study on the gender identity outcomes of female-raised 46 , xy persons with penile agenesis , cloacal exstrophy of the bladder , or penile ablation , found that 78 % of the study subjects were living as female , as opposed to 22 % who decided to initiate a sex change to male in line with their genetic sex an intersex human or other animal is one possessing any of several variations in sex characteristics including chromosomes , gonads , sex hormones , or genitals that , according to the un office of the

and looking like their identified gender '' the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders ( 302.85 ) has five criteria that must be met before a diagnosis of gender identity disorder can be made , and the disorder is further subdivided into specific diagnoses based on age , for example gender identity disorder in children ( for children who experience gender dysphoria ) in some cases , a person 's gender identity is inconsistent with their biological sex characteristics ( genitals and secondary sex characteristics ) , resulting in individuals dressing and/or behaving in a way

a 26-year-old woman with xy chromosomes whose penis was lost and who underwent sex reassignment surgery between two and seven months of age ( substantially earlier than reimer ) , whose parents were also more committed to raising their child as a girl than reimer 's , and who remained a woman into adulthood research has indicated that many parents attempt to define gender for their sons in a manner that distances the sons from femininity , with kane stating that '' the parental boundary maintenance work evident for sons represents a crucial obstacle limiting boys options , separating boys from girls , devaluing activities marked as feminine for both boys and girls , and thus bolstering gender inequality and heteronormativity some people , and some societies , do not construct gender as a binary in which everyone is either a boy or a girl , or a man or a woman kathleen stock has written that because gender identity is based on a person 's feelings , it is detached from both a person 's sex and their gender ( in the socially constructed sense ) his work at johns hopkins university 's gender identity clinic ( established in 1965 ) popularized an interactionist theory of gender identity , suggesting that , up to a certain age , gender identity is relatively fluid and subject to constant negotiation in the late 1980s , judith butler began lecturing regularly on the topic of gender identity , and in 1990 , she published gender trouble , introducing the concept of gender performativity and arguing that both sex and gender are constructed in late-19th-century medical literature , women who chose not to conform to their expected gender roles were called '' inverts '' , and they were portrayed as having an interest in knowledge and learning , and a '' dislike and sometimes incapacity for needlework '' the study concludes : '' the findings clearly indicate an increased risk of later patient-initiated gender re-assignment to male after female assignment in infancy or early childhood , but are nevertheless incompatible with the notion of a full determination of core gender identity by prenatal androgens '' to this day they are usually used in that sense , though a few scholars additionally use the term to refer to the sexual orientation and sexual identity categories gay , lesbian and bisexual in particular , the extent to which it is determined by socialization ( environmental factors ) versus innate ( biological ) factors is an ongoing debate in psychology , known as '' nature versus nurture '' however , vandermassen also argues that transgender people support the idea of gender identity as being biologically rooted , as they do not identify with their anatomical sex despite being raised and their behaviour reinforced according to

it to be a man or a woman , fitting a male or female gender role defined partly by the parents 44 : '' when assigned and raised as boys , these genetic girls adopt a male gender identity and role , showing that a y chromosome is not necessary for gender development to proceed in a male direction 43 the '' yogyakarta principles in action '' says '' it is important to note that while 'sexual orientation ' has been declassified as a mental illness in many countries , 'gender identity ' or 'gender identity disorder ' often remains in consideration the authors of a 2005 academic paper questioned the classification of gender identity problems as a mental disorder , speculating that certain dsm revisions may have been made on a tit-for-tat basis when certain groups were pushing for the removal of homosexuality as a disorder wallien , psychosexual outcome of gender-dysphoric children ( 2008 ) it has been suggested that the attitudes of the child 's parents may affect the child 's gender identity , although evidence is minimal barbara newmann breaks it down into four parts : ( 1 ) understanding the concept of gender , ( 2 ) learning gender role standards and stereotypes , ( 3 ) identifying with parents , and ( 4 ) forming gender preference in 1905 , sigmund freud presented his theory of psychosexual development in three essays on the theory of sexuality , giving evidence that in the pregenital phase children do not distinguish between sexes , but assume both parents have the same genitalia and reproductive powers there are parts of the community that take '' two-spirit '' as a category over an identity itself , preferring to identify with culture or nation-specific gender terms '' social factors which may influence gender identity include ideas regarding gender roles conveyed by family , authority figures , mass media , and other influential people in a child 's life coleman , developmental stages of the coming out process , in journal of
