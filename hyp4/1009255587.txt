modern day scaffolding standards , practices and processes can be attributed to these men and their companies : rapid scaffold tie company ltd , tubular scaffolding company and scaffolding great britain ltd ( sgb ) advancements in metallurgy throughout the early 20th century saw the introduction of tubular steel water pipes ( instead of timber poles ) with standardized dimensions , allowing for the industrial interchangeable parts and improving the structural stability of the scaffold the purpose of a working scaffold is to provide a safe working platform and access suitable for work crews to carry out their work the basic lightweight tube scaffolding that became the standard and revolutionised scaffolding , becoming the baseline for decades , was invented and marketed in the mid-1950s tubes are usually made either of steel or aluminium ; although there is composite scaffolding which uses filament-wound tubes of glass fibre in a nylon or polyester matrix , because of the high cost of composite tube , it is usually only used when there is a risk from overhead electric cables that can not be isolated they are seasoned wood and come in three thicknesses ( 38 & nbsp ; mm ( usual ) , 50 & nbsp ; mm and 63 & nbsp ; mm ) are a standard width ( 225 & nbsp ; mm ) and are a maximum of 3.9 m long in addition to the boards for the working platform , there are sole boards which are placed beneath the scaffolding if the surface is soft or otherwise suspect , although ordinary boards can also be used another solution , called a scaffpad , is made from a rubber base with a base plate moulded inside ; these are desirable for use on uneven ground since they adapt , whereas sole boards may split and have to be replaced other common scaffolding components include base plates , ladders , ropes , anchor ties , reveal ties , gin wheels , sheeting , etc bamboo scaffolding is widely used in hong kong and macau , '' craft of bamboo scaffolding '' praça do tap seac , edif in india , bamboo or other wooden scaffolding is also mostly used , with poles being lashed together using ropes made from coconut hair ( coir ) the standards , also called uprights , are the vertical tubes that transfer the entire weight of the structure to the ground where they rest on a square base plate to spread the load the base plate has a shank in its centre to hold the tube and is sometimes pinned to a sole board main transoms are placed next to the standards , they hold the standards in place and provide support for boards ; intermediate transoms are those placed between the main transoms to provide extra support for boards as well as the tubes at right angles there are cross braces to increase rigidity , these are placed diagonally from ledger to ledger , next to the standards to which they are fitted to limit sway a facade brace is fitted to the face of the scaffold every 30 metres or so at an angle of 35°-55° running right from the base to the top of the scaffold and fixed at every level of the couplers previously mentioned , right-angle couplers join ledgers or transoms to standards , putlog or single couplers join board bearing transoms to ledgers - non-board bearing transoms should be fixed using a right-angle coupler for a general purpose scaffold the maximum bay length is 2.1 m , for heavier work the bay size is reduced to 2 or even 1.8 m while for inspection a bay width of up to 2.7 m is allowed the scaffolding width is determined by the width of the boards , the minimum width allowed is 600 & nbsp ; mm but a more typical four-board scaffold would be 870 & nbsp ; mm wide from standard to standard transom spacing is determined by the thickness of the boards supported , 38 & nbsp ; mm boards require a transom spacing of no more than 1.2 m while a 50 & nbsp ; mm board can stand a transom spacing of 2.6 m and 63 & nbsp ; mm boards can have a maximum span of 3.25 m the ties are coupled to the scaffold as close to the junction of standard and ledger ( node point ) as possible a vertical inside tube crossing the opening is attached to the scaffold by a transom and a crossing horizontal tube on the outside called a bridle tube two additional transoms are put across from the lift on each side of the feature and are joined on both sides with shorter tubes called tie tubes when a complete box tie is impossible a l-shaped lip tie can be used to hook the scaffold to the structure , to limit inward movement an additional transom , a butt transom , is placed hard against the outside face of the structure bamboo scaffolding is a type of scaffolding made from bamboo and widely used in construction work for centuries many famous landmarks , notably the great wall of china , were built using bamboo scaffolding , and its use continues today in some parts of the world it was widely used in the building of houses and multi-story buildings ( up to four stories high ) prior to the development of metal scaffolding they are not going to do that kind of work , ” said yu hang flord , who has been a scaffolder for 30 years and later became the director of wui fai holdings , a member of the hong kong and kowloon scaffolders general merchants association in fact , bamboo is an essential building and construction commodity in nigeria ; the bamboo materials are transported on heavy trucks and trailers from rural areas ( especially the tropical rain forest ) to cities and the northern part of nigeria some of the structures in relaxation and recreation centres , both in urban and rural areas of nigeria , are put in place using bamboo materials forms of bamboo scaffolding include : double-row scaffold only double-row bamboo scaffold is allowed to be used for working at height access and egress suitable means of access should be provided from the building or ground level to the scaffold such as gangway , stairs and ladder etc bamboo scaffolding does not need to have a foundation on the ground , as long as the scaffolding has a fulcrum for structural support the flexibility and convenience of this type of scaffolding suits stages set up for temporary use and also separates the audience from the performers types of scaffolding covered by the occupational health and safety administration in the united states include the following categories : pole ; tube and coupler ; fabricated frame ( tubular welded frame scaffolds ) ; plasterers ’ , decorators ’ , and large area scaffolds ; bricklayers ' ( pipe ) ; horse ; form scaffolds and carpenters ’ bracket scaffolds ;
