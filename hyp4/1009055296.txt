the first music genre to be commonly known as honky-tonk music was a style of piano playing related to ragtime but emphasizing rhythm more than melody or harmony ; the style evolved in response to an environment in which the pianos were often poorly cared for , tending to be out of tune and having some nonfunctioning keys an article in the los angeles times of july 28 , 1929 , with the headline honky-tonk ' origin told '' , which was probably in response to the sophie tucker movie musical , honky tonk ( 1929 ) , reads : honky-tonks were rough establishments , providing country music in the deep south and southwest and serving alcoholic beverages to a working class clientele '' ( '' honky tonk ( not from tonk pianos ) ' '' , retrieved july 9 , 2006 ) ( which used the term to refer to an adult establishment in fort worth ) , and in 1894 in the ardmoreite in oklahoma , the daily ardmoreite ( oklahoma ) , february 26 , 1894 , p in the 1950s , honky tonk entered its golden age , with the popularity of webb pierce , hank locklin , lefty frizzell , faron young , george jones , and hank williams copyrighted and released in 1941 , '' walking the floor over you '' , by ernest tubb , '' walking the floor over you '' sheet music by george iv hamilton , sheetmusicnow.com ernest tubb , country music hall of fame and museum his sixth release for decca , country music hall of fame and museum helped establish the honky-tonk style and tubb as one of its foremost practitioners in the years before world war ii , the music industry began to refer to honky-tonk music played from texas and oklahoma to the west coast as hillbilly music although the derivation of the term is unknown , honky tonk originally referred to bawdy variety shows in the west ( oklahoma and indian territories and texas ) and to the theaters housing them the capitalization of the term suggests that it may have been the proper name of the theater ; it is not known whether the name was taken from a generic use of the term or whether the name of the theater became a generic term for similar establishments the vocals were originally rough and nasal , as exemplified by the singer-songwriters floyd tillman and hank williams , but later developed a clear and sharp sound , such as that of george jones and faron young the sound of honky-tonk ( or honk-a-tonk ) and the types of places that were called honky-tonks suggests that the term may be an onomatopoeia reference to the loud , boisterous music and noise heard at these establishments in the mid- to late 1950s , rockabilly ( which melded honky-tonk country with rhythm and blues ) and the slick country music of the nashville sound ended honky-tonk 's initial period of dominance tubb , from crisp , texas , was a fan of jimmie rodgers and fused western swing , which had been using electric guitars for years , with other '' country '' sounds however , in contemporary accounts these were nearly always called hurdy-gurdy shows , possibly derived from the term hurdy-gurdy , which was sometimes mistakenly applied to a small , portable barrel organ that was frequently played by organ grinders and buskers katrina hazzard-gordon wrote that the honky-tonk was '' the first urban manifestation of the jook '' , and that '' the name itself became synonymous with a style of music '' early uses of the term in print mostly appear along a corridor roughly coinciding with cattle drive trails extending from dallas and fort worth , texas , into south central oklahoma , suggesting that the term may have been a localism spread by cowboys driving cattle to market c7 the rough riders were recruited from the ranches of texas , new mexico , oklahoma and indian territories , so the term was still in popular use during the spanishâ€“american war among the most popular plays are 'the dalton boys ' and 'mildred , the she-devil of the plains , ' for the old traditions still are respected to a certain extent , though the participation of the audience is no longer solicited whatever the feeling of a long-suffering public , the honkatonk vocalists never will permit 'sweet rosie o'grady ' and 'just one girl ' to perish from the earth , and coon songs are sung as may irwin never did and never will sing them
