in direct violation of his promises of free trade within the cfs under the terms of the berlin treaty , not only had the state become a commercial entity directly or indirectly trading within its dominion , but also , leopold had been slowly monopolizing a considerable amount of the ivory and rubber trade by imposing export duties on the resources traded by other merchants within the cfs henry morton stanley , the congo and the founding of the congo free state ( london , 1885 ) report of the british consul , roger casement , on the administration of the congo free state , reprinted in full in the eyes of another race : roger casement ’ s congo report and 1903 diary edited by seamas o siochain and michael o ’ sullivan in the aftermath of the 1998 publication of king leopold 's ghost by adam hochschild , where he had written '' the killing in the congo was of genocidal proportions '' , but '' it was not strictly speaking a genocide '' , the guardian reported that the royal museum for central africa in brussels would finance an investigation into some of the claims made by hochschild jan vansina returned to the issue of quantifying the total population decline , and revised his earlier position , he concluded that the kuba population ( one of the many congolese populations ) was rising during the first two decades of leopold ii 's rule , and declined with 25 percent from 1900 to 1919 , mainly due to sickness antwerp is a colonial city , by bas de roo heart of darkness , the novel the crime of the congo , by sir arthur conan doyle at google books a journal of a tour in the congo free state , 1905 , by marcus dorman , from project gutenberg catalogue of the edmund morel papers at the archives division of the london school of economics critics , including hochschild , claimed that there were '' distortions and evasions '' in the exhibition and stated : '' the exhibit deals with this question in a wall panel misleadingly headed 'genocide in the congo ?

open letter to his serene majesty léopold ii , king of the belgians and sovereign of the independent state of congo '' , sent on july 18 , 1890 , williams described in great detail the crimes committed against the residents of the congo and their overall mistreatment in 1894 , king leopold ii signed a treaty with the united kingdom which conceded a strip of land on the free state 's eastern border in exchange for the lado enclave , which provided access to the navigable nile and extended the free state 's sphere of influence northwards into sudan sheppard 's documented cases of cruelty or violence were in direct violation of the berlin act of 1885 , which gave leopold ii control over the congo as long as he '' cared for the improvements of their conditions of their moral and material well-being '' and '' helped in suppressing slavery in the absence of a census providing even an initial idea of the size of population of the region at the inception of the congo free state ( the first was taken in 1924 ) , it is impossible to quantify population changes in the period in 1910 , following the belgian annexation of the congo free state as the belgian congo in 1908 and the death of the belgian king in december 1909 , british authorities reclaimed the lado enclave as per the anglo-congolese treaty signed in 1894 , and added the territory to anglo-egyptian sudan the free trade zone in the congo was open to entrepreneurs of any european nation , who were allowed to buy 10- & nbsp ; and 15-year monopoly leases on anything of value : ivory from a district or the rubber concession , for example hochschild cites several recent independent lines of investigation , by anthropologist jan vansina and others , that examine local sources ( police records , religious records , oral traditions , genealogies , personal diaries ) , which generally agree with the assessment of the 1919 belgian government commission : roughly half the population perished during the free state period one of the main ways england was involved in ending leopold ii of belgium ’ s rule in the congo , was by making belgium , as a whole , more aware of the brutality present in the congo leopold ii lost the absolute power he had had there , but the population now had a belgian colonial regime , which had become heavily paternalism , with church , state , and private companies all instructed to oversee the welfare of the inhabitants congolese communities in the domaine privé were not merely forbidden by law to sell items to anyone but the state ; they were required to provide state officials with set quotas of rubber and ivory at a fixed , government-mandated price and to provide food to the local post after widespread criticism , this '' primes system '' was substituted for the allocation de retraite in which a large part of the payment was granted , at the end of the service , only to those territorial agents and magistrates whose conduct was judged '' satisfactory '' by their superiors a reduction of the population of the congo is noted by all who have compared the country at the beginning of leopold 's control with the beginning of belgian state rule in 1908 , but estimates of the death toll vary considerably shortly after the anti-slavery conference he held in brussels in 1889 , leopold issued a new decree which said that africans could only sell their harvested products ( mostly ivory and rubber ) to the state in a large part of the free state reporting back to the foreign office in 1900 , casement wrote : the root of the evil lies in the fact that

, numbering around three-thousand , and was to strike north through the jungle and attack the rebels at their base at rejaf the first change was the introduction of the concept of terres vacantes , '' vacant '' land , which was any land that did not contain a habitation or a cultivated garden plot suddenly , the only outlet a large share of the local population had for their products was the state , which could set purchase prices and therefore could control the amount of income the congolese could receive for their work the belgian parliament , pushed by emile vandervelde and other critics of the king 's congolese policy , forced leopold to set up an independent commission of inquiry , and despite the king 's efforts , in 1905 it confirmed casement 's report many of the black soldiers were from far-off peoples of the upper congo , while others had been kidnapped in raids on villages in their childhood and brought to roman catholic missions , where they received a military training in

yielding to international pressure , the parliament of belgium annexed the congo free state and took over its administration on november 15 , 1908 , as the colony of the belgian congo in 1893 , leopold excised the most readily accessible portion of the free trade zone and declared it to be the domaine de la couronne , literally , '' fief of the crown '' articles were published in both magazines and newspapers in order to make the people of these powerful countries , such as the u.s and england , more aware of what truly was being done in this part of africa armed with modern weapons and the chicotte—a bull whip made of hippopotamus hide—the force publique routinely took and tortured hostages , slaughtered families of rebels , and flogged and raped congolese people with a

exploitational activities to monopolize the resources of the entire congo free state , leopold issued three decrees in 1891 and 1892 that reduced the native population to serfs in terms of infrastructure , leopold 's regime began construction of the railway that ran from the coast to the capital of leopoldville ( now kinshasa ) a decree in 1892 divided the terres vacantes into a
