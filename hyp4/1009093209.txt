there is no consensus on when and how they penetrated the amazon basin ; they may have done so during the miocene from the pacific ocean , before the formation of the andes , or from the atlantic ocean in 2002 , following the analysis of mitochondrial dna specimens from the orinoco basin , the putumayo river ( tributary of the amazon ) and the tijamuchy and ipurupuru rivers , geneticists proposed that genus inia be divided into at least two evolutionary lineages : one restricted to the river basins of bolivia and the other widely distributed in the orinoco and amazon a recent study , with more comprehensive sampling of the madeira system , including above and below the teotonio rapids ( which were thought to obstruct gene flow ) , found that the inia above the rapids did not possess unique mtdna in addition , a 2014 study identifies a third species in the araguaia-tocantins basin , but this designation is not recognized by any international organization and the committee on taxonomy of the society for marine mammalogy suggests this analysis is not persuasive inia geoffrensis geoffrensis inhabits most of the amazon river , including rivers tocantins , araguaia , low xingu and tapajos , the madeira to the rapids of porto velho , and rivers purus , yurua , ica , caqueta , branco , and the rio negro through the channel of casiquiare to san fernando de atabapo in the orinoco river , including its tributary : the guaviare inia geoffrensis boliviensis has populations in the upper reaches of the madeira river , upstream of the rapids of teotonio , in bolivia adult males reach a maximum length and weight of ( average and ( average , while females reach a length and weight of ( mean and ( average it has very evident sexual dimorphism , with males measuring and weighing between 16 % and 55 % more than females , making it unique among cetaceans , where females are generally larger than males the flukes are broad and triangular , and the dorsal fin , which is keel-shaped , is short in height but very long , extending from the middle of the body to the caudal region life expectancy of the amazon river dolphin in the wild is unknown , but in captivity , the longevity of healthy individuals has been recorded at between 10 and 30 years due to the high level of prey fish , larger group-sizes are seen in large sections that are directly influenced by whitewater ( such as main rivers and lakes , especially during low water season ) than in smaller sections influenced by blackwater ( such as channels and smaller tributaries ) however , dolphins in captivity may not show the same behavior that they do in their natural environment , where they have been reported to hold the oars of the fishermen , rub against the boat , pluck underwater plants , and play with sticks , logs , clay , turtles , snakes , and fish the behavior is '' triggered by an unusually large number of adult males and/or adult females in a group , or perhaps it attracts such into the group a plausible explanation of the results is that object-carrying is aimed at females and is stimulated by the number of females in the group , while aggression is aimed at other adult males and is stimulated by object-carrying in the group males often have a significant degree of damage in the dorsal , caudal , and pectoral fins , as well as the blowhole , due to bites and abrasions a high frequency of copulations in a couple was observed ; they used three different positions : contacting the womb at right angles , lying head to head , or head to tail as the water level begins to decrease , the density of food sources in flooded areas increases due to loss of space , providing enough energy for infants to meet the high demands required for growth sometimes , they associate with the distantly-related tucuxi ( sotalia fluviatilis ) , and giant otters ( pteronura brasiliensis ) to hunt in a coordinated manner , by gathering and attacking fish stocks at the same time amazonian rivers are often very murky , and the amazon river dolphin is therefore likely to depend much more on its sense of echolocation than vision when navigating and finding prey toothed whales generally do not produce a new echolocation click until all relevant echoes from the previous click have been received , so if detectable echoes are only reflected back from nearby objects , the echoes will quickly return , and the amazon river dolphin is then able to click at a high rate this in turn allow these animals to have a high acoustic update rate on their surroundings which may aid prey tracking when echolocating in shallow rivers and flooded forests with plenty of hiding places for the prey they are also distributed in the basin of the orinoco river , except the caroni river and the upper caura river in venezuela the distribution of dolphins in the rivers and surrounding areas depends on the time of year ; in the dry season they are located in the river beds , but in the rainy season , when the rivers overflow , they disperse to the flooded areas , both the forests and the plains in a study conducted in the stretch of the amazon called solimões river , with a length of between the cities of manaus and tabatinga , a total of 332 individuals was sighted ± 55 per inspection as a result of the studies conducted , it was found that the density is higher in the riverbanks , 3.7 per km , decreasing towards the center of the river the amazon river dolphin is located in most of the area 's aquatic habitats , including ; river basins , major courses of rivers , canals , river tributaries , lakes , and at the ends of rapids and waterfalls males and females appear to have selective habitat preferences , with the males returning to the main river channels when water levels are still high , while the females and their offspring remain in the flooded areas as long as possible ; probably because it decreases the risk of aggression by males toward the young and predation by other species one of these ecosystems is a floodplain , or a várzea forest , and is home to a large number of fish species which are an essential resource for human consumption human fishing activities directly compete with the dolphins for the same fish species , the tambaqui ( colossoma macropomum ) and the pirapitinga ( piaractus brachypomus ) , resulting in deliberate or unintentional catches of the amazon river dolphin the local fishermen overfish and when the amazon river dolphins remove the commercial catch from the nets and lines , it causes damages to the equipment and the capture , as well as generating ill will from the local fishermen the negative reactions of the local fishermen are also attributed to the brazilian institute of environment and renewable natural resources prohibition on killing the amazon river dolphin , yet not compensating the fishermen for the damage done to their equipment and catch more importantly , the local fishermen do not report these deaths out of fear that a legal course of action will be taken against them , as the amazon river dolphin and other cetaceans are protected under a brazilian federal law prohibiting any takes , harassments , and kills of the species in 2008 , the international whaling commission ( iwc ) expressed concern for captured botos for use as bait in the central amazon , which is an emerging problem that has spread on a large scale the species is listed in appendix ii of the cites ( cites ) , and appendix ii of the convention on the conservation of migratory species of wild animals , because it has an unfavorable conservation status or would benefit significantly from international co-operation organized by tailored agreements according to a previous assessment by the scientific committee of the international whaling commission in 2000 , the population of botos appears great and there is little or no evidence of population decline in numbers and range however , increased human intervention on their habitat is expected to , in the future , be the most likely cause of the decline of its range and population a series of recommendations were issued to ensure proper follow-up to the species , among which is the implementation and publication of studies on the structure of populations , making a record of the distribution of the species , information about potential threats as the magnitude of fishing operations and location of pipelines in traditional amazon river folklore , at night , an amazon river dolphin becomes a handsome young man who seduces girls , impregnates them , and then returns to the river in the morning to become a dolphin again according to the pink amazon river dolphin myth , it is said that this creature takes form of a human and seduces men and woman to the underworld of encante river dolphin research program—research project devoted to the study of the ecology and conservation of river dolphins in the amazon basin , based in the federal university of western pará
