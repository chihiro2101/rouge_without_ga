it referred to an area in the rear of a ship where the cockswain 's station was located , the cockswain being the pilot of a smaller '' boat '' that could be dispatched from the ship to board another ship or to bring people ashore thus by the 18th century , '' cockpit '' had come to designate an area in the rear lower deck of a warship where the wounded were taken the same term later came to designate the place from which a sailing vessel is steered , because it is also located in the rear , and is often in a well or '' pit '' according to the barnhart concise dictionary of etymology , the buildings in london where the king 's cabinet worked ( the treasury and the privy council ) were called the '' cockpit '' because they were built on the site of a theater called the cockpit ( torn down in 1635 ) , which itself was built in the place where a '' cockpit '' for cock-fighting had once stood prior to the 1580s in an airliner , the cockpit is usually referred to as the flight deck , the term deriving from its use by the raf for the separate , upper platform in large flying boats where the pilot and co-pilot sat the first airplane with an enclosed cabin appeared in 1912 on the avro type f ; however , during the early 1920s there were many passenger aircraft in which the crew remained open to the air while the passengers sat in a cabin except for some helicopters , the right seat in the cockpit of an aircraft is the seat used by the co-pilot the majority of the systems-related controls ( such as electrical , fuel , hydraulics and pressurization ) for example , are usually located in the ceiling on an overhead panel a central concept in the design of the cockpit is the design eye position or '' dep '' , from which point all displays should be visible in the modern electronic cockpit , the electronic flight instruments usually regarded as essential are mfd , pfd , nd , eicas , fms/cdu and back-up instruments a multi-function display , usually a long narrow panel located centrally in front of the pilot , may be used to control heading , speed , altitude , vertical speed , vertical navigation and lateral navigation mfd is a boeing designation ( that has been informally adopted as a generic name for the unit/panel ) for a unit that allows for the selection and parameter setting of the different autoflight functions , the same unit on an airbus aircraft is referred to as the fcu ( flight control unit ) the engine indication and crew alerting system ( used for boeing ) or electronic centralized aircraft monitor ( for airbus ) will allow the pilot to monitor the following information : values for n1 , n2 and n3 , fuel temperature , fuel flow , the electrical system , cockpit or cabin temperature and pressure , control surfaces and so on in a less prominent part of the cockpit , in case of failure of the other instruments , there will be a battery-powered integrated standby instrument system along with a magnetic compass , showing essential flight information such as speed , altitude , attitude and heading this standard defines the interface between an independent cockpit display system , generally produced by a single manufacturer , and the avionics equipment and user applications it is required to support , by means of displays and controls , often made by different manufacturers
