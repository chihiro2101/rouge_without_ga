creating an enduring power of attorney requires the following : it must be in a particular format a statement from a doctor stating that the doctor thought the donor had the mental capacity to understand the effect of creating the power of attorney when the document was executed a statement from the donor to say that they understood the effect of creating the power a statement from a solicitor to say they are satisfied that the donor understood the effect of creating the power of attorney a statement from a solicitor to say the donor was not acting under undue influence the courts play a general supervisory role in the implementation of the power under the common law , a power of attorney becomes ineffective if its grantor dies or becomes '' incapacitated , '' meaning unable to grant such a power , because of physical injury or mental illness , for example , unless the grantor ( or principal ) specifies that the power of attorney will continue to be effective even if the grantor becomes incapacitated a power of attorney can last , notwithstanding the incapacity of the donor , only if it is a lasting power of attorney : this is a separate and quite different type of power , which must be in a prescribed form , and , to be valid , once signed and witnessed must also be registered with the office of the public guardian see , for instance , the ontario substitute decisions act if a person does not have the capacity to execute a power of attorney ( and does not already have a durable power in place ) , often the only way for another party to act on their behalf is to have a court impose a conservatorship or a guardianship if someone is already incapacitated , it is not possible for that person to execute a valid power , although in some jurisdictions , it may be possible for someone to have the capacity to execute a power of attorney even if they do not have the capacity to make the decisions that they are delegating however , if the principal does not inform third parties and it is reasonable for the third parties to rely upon the power of attorney being in force , the principal might still be bound by the acts of the agent , though the agent may also be liable for such unauthorized acts this type of power of attorney is called '' power of attorney with durable provisions '' in the united states or '' enduring power of attorney '' , '' lasting '' or '' continuing '' power of attorney elsewhere if that separate contract is in writing , as a separate document it may be kept private between the principal and agent even when the power of attorney is presented to others for the purposes of carrying out the agent 's duties for example , if a bank has regulations that require the grantor to be physically present in the bank to perform certain actions , the poa can not grant the agent power to perform those actions in the absence of the grantor this means , for example , that if a principal authorizes someone to sell the principal 's house or other real property , and the law requires a contract for the sale of real property to be in writing ( which is required under the statute of frauds in most u.s see section 16 of act 122 of 200ли '' on state registration of interests in immovable property and related transactions '' ( in russian ) a power of attorney must also be dated , pursuant to article 186 of the russian civil code a solicitor is not required to create a power of attorney - it is created simply by being signed by the donor , in the presence of ( and countersigned by ) a witness an attorney-in-fact may be a layperson and is authorized to act pursuant to the powers granted by a power of attorney but may not engage in acts that would constitute the unauthorized practice of law in effect , under a durable power of attorney , the authority of the attorney-in-fact to act and/or make decisions on behalf of the grantor continues until the grantor 's death although a power of attorney grants the agent powers to perform acts in the absence of the grantor , the poa can not grant powers to the agent that conflict with rules and regulations governing people and companies that the agent deals with many institutions , such as hospitals , banks and , in the united states , the internal revenue service , require a power of attorney to be in writing before they will honor it , and they will usually keep a duplicate original or a copy for their records in financial situations wherein a principal requests a securities broker to perform extensive investment functions on the principal 's behalf , independent of the principal 's advice , power of attorney must be formally granted to the broker to trade in the principal 's account it is a bureaucratic minefield , full of traps for the unwary ; and the end result can be disappointing , as many financial institutions do not trust lasting powers , viewing the attorney simply as a potential fraudster , and in practice tend to be highly uncooperative part 7 of the assisted decision-making ( capacity ) act 2015 provides for new arrangements for those who wish to make an enduring power of attorney and once the 2015 act is brought into force , no new powers of attorney will be created under the 1996 act for example , see the california statutory form power of attorney , new york form power of attorney and wisconsin form power of attorney , ontario power of attorney , and england and wales lasting power of attorney unless the power of attorney has been made irrevocable by its own terms or by some legal principle , the grantor may revoke the power of attorney by telling the attorney-in-fact it is revoked a power of attorney must still be signed by hand by all persons involved , in the right order , and witnessed directly , although possibly through a window , or in an outdoor setting under russian law , in article 185 of the russian civil code , a power of attorney can be created by being signed by the donor
