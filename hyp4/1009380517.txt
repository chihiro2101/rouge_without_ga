back at the palais garnier , the new managers receive a letter from the phantom demanding that they allow christine to perform the lead role of marguerite in faust , and that box 5 be left empty for his use , lest they perform in a house with a curse on it one book review from the new york times expressed disappointment in the way the phantom was portrayed , saying that the feeling of suspense and horror is lost once it is found out that the phantom is just a man and not a real ghost at a gala performance for the retirement of the opera house 's two managers , a young , little-known swedish soprano , christine daaé , is called upon to sing in place of the opera 's leading soprano , carlotta , who is ill , and christine ’ s performance is an astonishing success indeed , drumright notes that the phantom of the opera checks off every trope necessary to have a gothic novel according to the encyclopedia of literature 's description which says , “ such novels were expected to be dark and tempestuous and full of ghosts , madness , outrage , superstition , and revenge in the 1880s , in paris , the palais garnier opera house is believed to be haunted by an entity known as the phantom of the opera , or simply the opera ghost although previous commentators have asserted that the phantom of the opera did not attain as much success as these previous novels , being particularly unpopular in france where it was first published , recent research into the novel 's early reception and sales has indicated the contrary bill o'connell , an assistant to film producers in new york , contended for the original author 's name to be included with the book that the musical is '' based on '' rather than '' inspired by '' because he viewed the latter as a minimization of gaston leroux 's connection with the story she uses the example of how leroux introduces danse macabre which means '' dance of death '' in the gala scene which foreshadows the graveyard scene that comes later where the phantom plays the fiddle for christine and attacks raoul when he tries to intervene after being subcontracted to work on the palais garnier 's foundations , erik had discreetly built himself a lair to disappear in , complete with hidden passages and other tricks that allowed him to spy on the managers the majority of the notability that the novel acquired early on was due to its publication in a series of installments in french , american , and english newspapers ribière makes note that leroux was once a theatre critic and his brother was a musician , so he was knowledgeable about music and how to use it as a framing device ” although the phantom is really just a deformed man , he has ghost-like qualities in that no one can ever find him or his lair and he is seen as a monster he had written six novels prior , two of which had garnered substantial popularity within their first year of publication called the mystery of the yellow room and the perfume of the lady in black on the roof of the opera house , christine tells raoul about her abduction and makes raoul promise to take her away to a place where erik can never find her , even if she resists he ran away from his native normandy to work in fairs and caravans , schooling himself in the arts of the circus across europe and asia , and eventually building trick palaces in persia and turkey still , she causes him to change his plans when she unmasks him and , to the horror of both , beholds his noseless , sunken-eyed face , which resembles a skull dried up by the centuries the managers assume his demands are a prank and ignore them , resulting in disastrous consequences , as carlotta ends up croaking like a toad , and the chandelier suddenly drops into the audience , killing a spectator erik : the phantom of the opera , a deformed conjurer also referred to as the angel of music and the opera ghost stylistically , the novel is framed as a mystery novel as it is narrated through a detective pulling his information from various forms of research by the time leroux published the phantom of the opera , he had already gained credibility as a crime mystery author in both french- and english-speaking countries
