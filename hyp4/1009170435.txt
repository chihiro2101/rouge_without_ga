the medium consists of a glass plate coated on one side with a random mosaic of microscopic grains of potato starch dyed red-orange , green , and blue-violet ( an unusual but functional variant of the standard red , green , and blue additive colors ) ; the grains of starch act as color filters the use of an additional special orange-yellow filter in the camera was required to block ultraviolet light and restrain the effects of violet and blue light , parts of the spectrum to which the emulsion was overly sensitive because of the light loss due to all the filtering , autochrome plates required much longer exposures than black-and-white plates and films , which meant that a tripod or other stand had to be used and that it was not practical to photograph moving subjects the plate was reversal-processed into a positive transparency — that is , the plate was first developed into a negative image but not '' fixed '' , then the silver forming the negative image was chemically removed , then the remaining silver halide was exposed to light and developed , producing a positive image it was found that the application of extreme pressure would produce a mosaic that more efficiently transmitted light to the emulsion , because the grains would be flattened slightly , making them more transparent , and pressed into more intimate contact with each other , reducing wasted space between them patent describes the process more generally : the grains can be orange , violet , and green , or red , yellow , and blue ( or '' any number of colors '' ) , optionally with black powder filling the gaps experimentations within the early twentieth century provided solutions to many issues , including the addition of screen plates , a yellow filter designed to balance the blue , and adjustments to the size of the silver halide crystals to allow for a broader spectrum of colour and control over the frequency of light larger , non-stereoscopic plates were most commonly displayed in a diascope , which was a folding case with the autochrome image and a ground glass diffuser fitted into an opening on one side , and a mirror framed into the other side the use of a '' light box '' or similar highly diffused artificial light source for viewing autochromes , although now nearly universal , is unfortunate , as the heavy scattering of light within and among the several layers of coatings on the plate degrades the color saturation the slight pinkish tinge caused by colloidal scattering ( the effect seen through a glass of water into which a couple of drops of milk have been mixed ) is exacerbated , and the use of artificial light—especially fluorescent light—upsets the color rendition of a system which the lumière brothers carefully balanced for use with natural daylight making modern film or digital copies of autochromes introduces other problems , because a color system based on red , green , and blue is used to copy an image that exists within the red-orange , green , and blue-violet system , providing further opportunities for color degradation vintage reproductions of autochromes in old books and magazines have often been noticeably hand-adjusted by the photoengravers in an effort to compensate for some of the difficulties of reproduction , and as a result they sometimes look more like hand-colored photographs than '' natural color '' ones the lamination of the grains , varnish and emulsion makes autochrome plates susceptible to deterioration with each layer being vulnerable to changes in environment including moisture , oxidation , cracking , or flaking as well as physical damage from handling ; solutions include conservative lighting conditions , chemical free materials , medium-range humidity control of between 63 and 68 degrees fahrenheit , and a well designed preservation plan ” this term was first coined by john wood in his book the art of autochrome : the birth of colour photography ( iowa city : university of iowa press , 1993 ) and has subsequently become familiar terminology used in reference to autochrome images the collection , one of the biggest of its kind in the world , is housed in the albert kahn museum ( musée albert-kahn ) on the outskirts of paris ( compiled by ) , guide to the special collections of prints & photographs in the library of congress , the library of congress , washington , d.c has an extensive collection of early colour photography , including louise ducos du hauron 's earliest autochrome images and materials used by the lumiere brothers in physical arrangement , however , the bayer filter mosaic much more closely resembles the regular geometric pattern used in other color screen plates of the autochrome era , such as the paget and finlay plates jpg original , unused box of autochrome plates ( 1921 ) file : autochrome box - reverse side.jpg original , unused box of autochrome plates ( 1921 ) - reverse side , featuring different languages file : original autochrome instruction manual - front cover ( scan )
