including the nobel lecture , december 11 , 1953 the citric acid cycle 1953 prize in physiology or medicine nobel prizes deconstructing the tour , university of sheffield ( biography ) sir hans adolf krebs at whonamedit catalogue of the papers and correspondence of sir hans adolf krebs , frs ( 1900â€“1981 ) hans a these two reactions did not follow the normal citric acid cycle , and hence the pathway was named the glyoxylate bypass of the citric acid cycle , but is now known as the glyoxylate cycle after four months of experimental works to fill in the gaps , krebs and johnson succeeded in establishing the sequence of the chemical cycle , which they called the '' citric acid cycle '' in 1953 he received the nobel prize in physiology or medicine for his '' discovery of the citric acid cycle after four years in 1930 , with 16 publications to his credit , his mentor warburg urged him to move on and he took up the position of assistant in the department of medicine at the municipal hospital in altona ( now part of hamburg ) before a year was over at freiburg , he , with research student kurt henseleit , published their discovery of the ornithine cycle of urea synthesis , which is the metabolic pathway for urea formation he moved with his mrc unit to the university of oxford in 1954 as whitley professor of biochemistry , the post he held till his retirement in 1967 john ( john krebs , baron krebs ) became a renowned ornithologist , professor at the university of oxford , principal of jesus college , oxford , and british house of lords thus the urea cycle ( or '' ornithine cycle '' ) was established , and it was the first metabolic cycle to be discovered '' krebs immediately prepared a longer version titled '' the role of citric acid in intermediate metabolism in animal tissues '' , which he sent to the dutch journal enzymologia after two weeks and was published in two months he was appointed as demonstrator in biochemistry in 1934 and in 1935 the university of sheffield offered him a post of lecturer in pharmacology , with a more spacious laboratory and double the salary he was allowed to take an emergency examination for his high school diploma , which he passed with such a high score that he suspected the examiners of being '' unduly lenient and sympathetic '' with the rise of hitler 's nazi party to power , germany decreed the law for the restoration of the professional civil service , which decreed the removal of all non-germans , and anti-nazis , from professional occupations at the university of sheffield , krebs and william johnson investigated cellular respiration by which oxygen was consumed to produce energy from the breakdown of glucose one was malate synthase , which condenses acetate with glyoxylate to form malate , and the other was isocitrate lyase , which provides glyoxylate for the reaction by cleaving it from isocitrate an admirer , sir frederick gowland hopkins at the university of cambridge , immediately came to his rescue , and persuaded the university to recruit krebs to work with him in the department of biochemistry to obtain a doctor of medicine degree , and a medical license , he spent one year at the third medical clinic in the university of berlin while working at the medical clinic of the university of freiburg , krebs met kurt henseleit , with whom he investigated the chemical process of urea formation on 14 june he received a rejection letter from the editor , saying that the journal had '' already sufficient letters to fill correspondence columns for seven or eight weeks '' , and encouraging krebs to '' submit it for early publication to another periodical university of sheffield opened a department of biochemistry , now department of molecular biology and biotechnology , in 1938 and krebs became its first head , and eventually a professor in 1945 they proved to be pivotal to his later discoveries , especially the manometer developed by warburg specifically for the measurement of oxygen consumption in thin slices of tissues ; it was the basis for his research
