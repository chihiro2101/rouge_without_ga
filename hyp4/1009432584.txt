at least his sons did in 1628 , cecil accompanied his father , lord baltimore , along with most of his siblings and his stepmother , to the new colony of newfoundland lord baltimore , as cecil now was , received a charter from king charles i for the new colony of maryland , to be named for the queen consort , henrietta maria ( wife of king charles i ) this was shortly after the death , in april 1632 , of his father , the 1st baron baltimore , who had long sought the charter to found a colony in the mid-atlantic area to serve as a refuge for english roman catholics when the crown realised that settlers from virginia had already crossed the bay to begin settling the southern tip of their eastern shore , the grant was revised to include the eastern shore only as far south as a line drawn east from the mouth of the potomac river ( including the future state of delaware ) baltimore 's fee for the charter , which was legally a rental of the land from the king , was one-fifth of all gold and silver found and the delivery of two native american arrows to the royal castle at windsor every easter browne , pages 35–36 the charter established maryland as a palatinate , giving baltimore and his descendants rights nearly equal to those of an independent state , including the rights to wage war , collect taxes and establish a colonial nobility browne , page 37 supporters in england of the virginia colony opposed the charter , as they had little interest in having a competing colony to the north browne , page 43 they had informally tried to thwart the founding of another colony for years , but their first formal complaint was lodged with the '' board of trade '' ( lords of trade and plantations ) in july 1633 lord baltimore , a catholic , struggled to maintain possession of maryland during the english civil war by trying to convince parliament of his loyalty ; he appointed a protestant , william stone , as his governor in 1649 , maryland passed the maryland toleration act , also known as the '' act concerning religion '' , mandating religious tolerance for trinitarian christians only ( those who profess faith in the '' holy trinity '' – father , son and holy spirit , excluding nontrinitarian faiths ) passed on 21 september 1649 , by the general assembly of the maryland colony , it was the first law establishing religious tolerance in the british north american colonies the 1st baron baltimore administered the colony between 1629 and 1632 , when he left for the colony of virginia and later visited the northern reaches along the chesapeake bay ( which included the future maryland ) in 1637 , however , sir david kirke acquired a charter giving cecil , 2nd baron baltimore , title to the entire island of newfoundland , superseding the charter granted to his father george , 1st baron baltimore later , her name became the inspiration for the naming of one of the earliest counties to be '' erected '' ( founded ) , namely anne arundel county , maryland archives of maryland ( biographical series ) cecilius calvert , 2nd lord baltimore ( 1605–1675 ) retrieved february 2011 anne 's father built hook manor , a country house near semley , wiltshire for her in 1637 and gave the house ( which still stands ) to the couple in 1639 '' note for : cecil calvert - 2nd baron baltimore , 8 august 1605 - 30 november 1675 kiplin hall website retrieved july 2015 this is possibly due to poor record keeping of catholic burials national archives uk retrieved july 2015 or numerous outbreaks of disease that overwhelmed burial staff and led to confusion in parish registers leonard calvert cliffs anne arundel county ( anne arundel 's original spelling of her name is preserved in the name of the county 's heritage organisation – '' ann arundell county historical society '' ) street names cecil avenue calvert street charles street in baltimore calvert street in brooklyn neighbourhood of south baltimore calvert street in washington baltimore street in cumberland , maryland baltimore street in la plata , maryland , baltimore-annapolis boulevard ( maryland route 648 ) baltimore–washington parkway a 1908 statue of cecil , lord baltimore , for which francis x the flag of maryland uses the arms of the 2nd baron with the calvert ( father 's family ) black and gold paly ( 6 vertical bars ) , with a bend dexter counterchanged , and the crossland ( mother 's family ) red and white bottony ( tre-foiled ) counterchanged cross the flag first flew 11 october 1880 , in baltimore by the newly reorganised maryland national guard ( state militia ) at a parade marking the 150th anniversary of the founding of baltimore town ( 1729–1730 ) during the civil war , the black and gold chevrons were used as a symbol on uniforms and flags by the northern ( union ) maryland soldiers and units and the bottonee cross from the crosslands by the southern ( confederate ) regiments from maryland the later reunification of the two squares of the colonial seal and proprietary family 's coat-of-arms in the increased use of a '' maryland flag '' in the late 19th and early 20th centuries symbolised the post-war reconciliation of the two sides of the bitterly divided border state the black and gold quarters were the arms of the calverts themselves , while the red and silver were for the crosslands , the family of the 1st baron 's mother , alice
