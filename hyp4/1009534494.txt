before his solo successes , he was in demand as a writer , having co-written three series of the mrs merton show , as well as writing for many other television series in the uk , including the fast show the bet soon evolved into a monster as , on the way to meet dave gormans numbers 4 and 5 , wallace decided gorman must meet one for every card in the deck ( including the jokers ) his quest to meet this target is described , with highlights including : five people changing their names by deed poll ( two of whom were women ) ; a trip to new york that resulted in failure when he discovered the man he had gone to meet was not dave gorman , but b david gorman and therefore was ineligible ; and the american journey included a meeting with an actor who had played a character called david gorman , the validity of which is hotly contested in the book his second television series , broadcast on bbc two in september 2002 , was entitled dave gorman 's important astrology experiment and was based upon the idea of a controlled experiment , although naturally not a serious one on each episode of the show , gorman would show footage of the amusing situations he got into by trying to follow his horoscope , and then asked a panel of '' experts '' , agony aunt denise robertson ( love ) , gmtv 's dr following an audience vote , gorman would display on a '' happiness graph '' the difference between how he and his twin brother had fared that week , and whether it showed that astrology had produced a positive effect , a negative effect , or no significant effect at all throughout the experiment , he had numerous adventures , including travelling to new york city to meet a long lost friend and then leaving a few hours later because he was ordered to spend as much time at home as possible , sharing pizza in a park while dressed in a rubber suit , and reading an illegally acquired pornographic magazine at sunday lunch in front of his mother the most notable stunt he had to perform was standing in covent garden on one leg with his foot in a bucket of water , a tangerine in one hand and some breakfast cereal in the other ( in a bowl that cost £85 from harrods ) , singing the national anthem backwards and balancing three books on his head this was taken entirely literally from a very odd horoscope by jonathan cainer , which gorman deemed so implausible that he did in fact present the copy of the newspaper which published it in the studio , while noting his suspicion that perhaps the author of the horoscope found out about his experiment and was pulling a prank on him gorman showed that his wealth was rapidly declining , as were happiness and love , until , on the last day , he invested the last of his money to travel to dubai to watch a golf tournament ( the dubai desert classic ) and bet on ian woosnam , a golfer that shared his birthday ( and would therefore share his luck ) with his happiness at an all-time low , love scraping the bottom , and his finances in an extremely negative position , the experts , his mother , wallace , the crowd and gorman himself could only hope the bet would pay off – which it ultimately did at odds long enough to place him not only back at level wealth , but supplying him with twice as much cash as he had started off with in 2003 , gorman toured britain with a show entitled dave gorman 's googlewhack adventure , and published a book of the same name while trying to write a novel for his publisher , random house , gorman became obsessed with googlewhacks when someone notified him that his site had one ( francophile namesakes ) , and caused him to travel across the world finding people who had authored them ( one of whom turned out to be one of the dave gormans he had met in his first adventure ) he eventually spent his publisher 's advance on the quest , without writing any of the promised novel , and had to create the dave gorman 's googlewhack adventure show to pay them back it also sold out at the george square theatre as part of the 2003 edinburgh festival fringe before embarking on a major uk tour of 75 shows in the space of three months comedy arts festival in aspen , colorado , an award he had previously won for the show are you dave gorman ?
