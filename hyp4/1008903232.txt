at the rapid-charge rate , done at 100 % of the rated capacity of the battery in 1 hour ( 1c ) , the battery holds roughly 80 % of the charge , so a 100 & nbsp ; mah battery takes 125 & nbsp ; mah to charge ( that is , approximately 1 hour and fifteen minutes ) however , a ni–cd battery has a lower self-discharge rate ( for example , 20 % per month for a ni–cd battery , versus 30 % per month for a traditional nimh under identical conditions ) , although low self-discharge nimh battery are now available , which have substantially lower self-discharge than either ni–cd or traditional nimh batteries at one point , ni–cd batteries accounted for 8 % of all portable secondary ( rechargeable ) battery sales in the eu , and in the uk for 9.2 % ( disposal ) and in switzerland for 1.3 % of all portable battery sales the purpose of the over-charge is to expel as much ( if not all ) of the gases collected on the electrodes , hydrogen on the negative and oxygen on the positive , and some of these gases recombine to form water which in turn will raise the electrolyte level to its highest level after which it is safe to adjust the electrolyte levels whilst lead–acid batteries can be charged by simply connecting a dynamo to them , with a simple electromagnetic cut-out system for when the dynamo is stationary or an over-current occurs , the ni–cd battery under a similar charging scheme would exhibit thermal runaway , where the charging current would continue to rise until the over-current cut-out operated or the battery destroyed itself because many electronic devices are designed to work with primary cells that may discharge to as low as 0.90 to 1.0 & nbsp ; v per cell , the relatively steady 1.2 & nbsp ; v of a ni–cd cell is enough to allow operation however , if the battery is going to be stored unused for a long period of time , it should be discharged down to at most 40 % of capacity ( some manufacturers recommend fully discharging and even short-circuiting once fully discharged , and stored in a cool , dry environment when compared to other forms of rechargeable battery , the ni–cd battery has a number of distinct advantages : the batteries are more difficult to damage than other batteries , tolerating deep discharge for long periods under the so-called '' batteries directive '' ( 2006/66/ec ) , the sale of consumer ni–cd batteries has now been banned within the european union except for medical use ; alarm systems ; emergency lighting ; and portable power tools as a relatively small area of the electrode is in contact with the electrolyte ( as opposed to the jelly-roll design ) , the internal resistance for an equivalent sized alkaline cell is higher which limits the maximum current that can be delivered finally , a similarly sized ni–cd battery has a slightly lower internal resistance , and thus can achieve a higher maximum discharge rate ( which can be important for applications such as power tools ) ni–cd batteries contain between 6 % ( for industrial batteries ) and 18 % ( for commercial batteries ) cadmium , which is a toxic heavy metal and therefore requires special care during battery disposal however , if the device is unable to operate through this period of decreased voltage , it will be unable to get enough energy out of the battery , and for all practical purposes , the battery appears '' dead '' earlier than normal for example , an '' overnight '' charge , might consist of supplying a current equal to one tenth the amperehour rating ( c/10 ) for 14–16 hours ; that is , a 100 & nbsp ; mah battery takes 10 & nbsp ; ma for 14 hours , for a total of 140 & nbsp ; mah to charge at this rate this results in a preference for ni–cd over non-lsd nimh batteries in applications where the current draw on the battery is lower than the battery 's own self-discharge rate ( for example , television remote controls ) during charging , the battery temperature typically stays low , around the same as the ambient temperature ( the charging reaction absorbs energy ) , but as the battery nears full charge the temperature will rise to 45–50 & nbsp ; °c compared to ni–cd batteries , nimh batteries have a higher capacity and are less toxic , and are now more cost effective this is lower than the 1.5 & nbsp ; v of alkaline and zinc–carbon primary cells , and consequently they are not appropriate as a replacement in all applications for a common aa-size cell , the maximum discharge rate is approximately 1.8 & nbsp ; amperes ; for a d size battery the discharge rate can be as high as 3.5 & nbsp ; amperes the apparent symptom is that the battery '' remembers '' the point in its discharge cycle where recharging began and during subsequent use suffers a sudden drop in voltage at that point , as if the battery had been discharged in this , however , they have been largely superseded by lithium polymer ( lipo ) and lithium iron phosphate ( life ) batteries , which can provide even higher energy densities small cells are used for portable electronics and toys ( such as solar garden lights ) , often using cells manufactured in the same sizes as primary cells however , the ni–cd battery is still very useful in applications requiring very high discharge rates because it can endure such discharge with no damage or loss of capacity vented cell nicd batteries have long lives ( up to 20 years or more , depending on type ) and operate at extreme temperatures ( from −40 to 70 & nbsp ; °c ) when ni–cd batteries are substituted for primary cells , the lower terminal voltage and smaller ampere-hour capacity may reduce performance as compared to primary cells ni–cd batteries used to replace 9 & nbsp ; v batteries usually only have six cells , for a terminal voltage of 7.2 & nbsp ; volts ni–cd cells are available in the same sizes as alkaline battery , from aaa through d , as well as several multi-cell sizes , including the equivalent of a 9 volt battery regardless of the charge speed , more energy must be supplied to the battery than its actual capacity , to account for energy loss during charging , with faster charges being more efficient the alkaline electrolyte ( commonly koh ) is not consumed in this reaction and therefore its specific gravity , unlike in lead–acid batteries , is not a guide to its state of charge a fully charged single ni–cd cell , under no load , carries a potential difference of between 1.25 and 1.35 volts , which stays relatively constant as the battery is discharged a ni–cd battery is smaller and lighter than a comparable lead–acid battery , but not a comparable nimh or li-ion battery vented cell ( wet cell , flooded cell ) nicd batteries are used when large capacities and high discharge rates are required when jungner built the first ni-cd batteries , he used nickel oxide in the positive electrode , and iron and cadmium materials in the negative this is in contrast , for example , to lithium ion battery , which are less stable and will be permanently damaged if discharged below a minimum voltage since the vessel is designed to contain an exact amount of electrolyte this loss will rapidly affect the capacity of the cell and its ability to receive and deliver current since an alkaline battery near fully discharged may see its voltage drop to as low as 0.9 volts , ni–cd cells and alkaline cells are typically interchangeable for most applications a fully charged ni-cd cell contains : a nickel ( iii ) oxide-hydroxide positive plate electrode a cadmium negative electrode plate a separator , and an alkaline electrolyte ( potassium hydroxide )
