while many of those with brugada syndrome do not have any symptoms , brugada syndrome may cause fainting or sudden cardiac death due to serious abnormal heart rhythms such as ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia the first mutations described in association with brugada syndrome were in a gene responsible for a protein or ion channel that controls the flow of sodium through the cell membrane of heart muscle cells â€“ the sodium channel a long list of factors that can generate a brugada ecg pattern have been described , including certain medications , electrolyte disturbances such as a hypokalemia , and a ischemia to key areas of the heart , specifically the ventricular outflow tract however , a person diagnosed with the condition may be the first in their family to have brugada syndrome if it has arisen as a new mutation however , only 20 % of cases of brugada syndrome are associated with mutations in scn5a , as in the majority of patients with brugada syndrome genetic testing is unable to identify the genetic mutation responsible because of these complex interactions , some members of a family who carry a particular mutation may show evidence of brugada syndrome while other carrying the same mutation may not , referred to as variable penetrance brugada syndrome has been described as overlapping with arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia ( arvc ) caused by a mutation in the pkp2 gene , causing a brugada ecg pattern but structural changes in the heart characteristic of arvc the abnormal heart rhythms seen in those with brugada syndrome are typically dangerous arrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation or polymorphic ventricular tachycardia , but those with brs are also more likely to experience rapid heart rates due to less dangerous arrhythmias such as av nodal reentrant tachycardia and abnormally slow heart rhythms such as sick sinus syndrome the genetic variants associated with brs support the concept as scn5a , the gene most commonly associated with the condition , along with scn10a , scn1b , scn2b and scn3b , all directly affect the sodium current i na given the right circumstances , this wavebreak can allow the waves of electricity to perform a u-turn within the muscle , travelling in the reverse direction before beginning to rapidly circle around a point , referred to as re-entry , and causing an abnormal heart rhythm those who support this view ( known as the depolarisation hypothesis ) argue that conduction slowing may explain why arrhythmias in those with brugada syndrome tend to occur in middle age , when other factors such as scarring or fibrosis that accompany old age have exacerbated the tendency to conduction slowing caused by the genetic mutation others suggest that the main cause of arrhythmias is a difference in the electrical properties between the inside ( endocardium ) and outside ( epicardium ) of the heart ( known as the repolarisation hypothesis ) these patterns may be present all the time , but may appear only in response to particular drugs ( see below ) , when the person has a fever , during exercise , or as a result of other triggers the ecg pattern may become more obvious by performing an ecg in which some of the electrodes are placed in different positions from usual , specifically by placing leads v 1 and v 2 higher up the chest wall in the 1st or 2nd intercostal spaces according to current recommendations , only a type 1 ecg pattern , occurring either spontaneously or in response to medication , can be used to confirm the diagnosis of brugada syndrome as type 2 and 3 patterns are not infrequently seen in persons without the disease genetic testing can be helpful to identify patients with brugada syndrome , most commonly in family members of a person with brugada syndrome , but sometimes performed in a person who has died suddenly and unexpectedly invasive electrophysiology study , in which wires are passed through a vein to stimulate and record electrical signals from the heart , can sometimes be used to assess the risk of a person with brugada syndrome experiencing dangerous abnormal heart rhythms holter monitor , including implantation of a loop recorder , is sometimes used to assess whether dizziness or faints in a person with brugada syndrome are due to abnormal heart rhythms or other causes such as vasovagal syncope in people felt to be at higher risk of sudden cardiac death , an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator ( icd ) may be recommended because of the small risk associated with implanting an icd , as well as the cost of the devices , icds are not recommended for all people with brugada syndrome but are instead reserved for people deemed at higher risk of sudden cardiac death it is most frequently used in people with brugada syndrome who have an icd and have experienced several episodes of life-threatening arrhythmias , but may also be used in people at high risk of arrhythmias but in whom an icd is not appropriate while the rare cases seen in childhood are equally likely to be male or female , in adulthood symptoms occur more frequently in males than females , potentially due to the higher testosterone levels found in men brugada syndrome is more common in people of asian descent and is the most common cause of sudden death in young males without known underlying cardiac disease in thailand and laos brugada syndrome is named after the spanish cardiologists josep and pedro brugada who described the condition in 1992 , although the association between the characteristic ecg pattern and sudden cardiac death had been reported in 1989 the first genetic mutations affecting the scn5a gene associated with the syndrome were identified by their brother ramon brugada in 1998 , with many more mutations affecting at least 19 genes subsequently identified by others
