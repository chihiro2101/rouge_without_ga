although beta blockers were once contraindicated in congestive heart failure , as they have the potential to worsen the condition due to their effect of decreasing cardiac contractility , studies in the late 1990s showed their efficacy at reducing morbidity and mortality bisoprolol , carvedilol , and sustained-release metoprolol are specifically indicated as adjuncts to standard ace inhibitor and diuretic therapy in congestive heart failure , although at doses typically much lower than those indicated for other conditions beta-blockers are only indicated in cases of compensated , stable congestive heart failure ; in cases of acute decompensated heart failure , beta-blockers will cause a further decrease in ejection fraction , worsening the patient 's current symptoms beta-blockers are known primarily for their reductive effect on heart rate , although this is not the only mechanism of action of importance in congestive heart failure beta-blockers cause a decrease in renin secretion , which in turn reduces the heart oxygen demand by lowering the extracellular volume and increasing the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood heart failure characteristically involves increased catecholamine activity on the heart , which is responsible for several deleterious effects , including increased oxygen demand , propagation of inflammatory mediators , and abnormal cardiac tissue remodeling , all of which decrease the efficiency of cardiac contraction and contribute to the low ejection fraction therapeutic administration of beta-blockers for congestive heart failure ought to begin at very low doses ( 1/8 of target ) with a gradual escalation of the dose musicians , public speakers , actors , and professional dancers have been known to use beta-blockers to avoid performance anxiety , stage fright , and tremor during both auditions and public performances the application to stage fright was first recognized in the lancet in 1976 , and by 1987 , a survey conducted by the international conference of symphony orchestra musicians , representing the 51 largest orchestras in the united states , revealed 27 % of its musicians had used beta-blockers and 70 % obtained them from friends , not physicians beta-blockers are inexpensive , said to be relatively safe , and on one hand , seem to improve musicians ' performances on a technical level , while some , such as barry green , the author of '' the inner game of music '' and don greene , a former olympic diving coach who teaches juilliard students to overcome their stage fright naturally , say the performances may be perceived as '' soulless and inauthentic '' because they promote lower heart rates and reduce tremors , beta blockers have been used in professional sports where high accuracy is required , including archery , shooting , golf and snooker adverse drug reactions associated with the use of beta blockers include : nausea , diarrhea , bronchospasm , dyspnea , cold extremities , exacerbation of raynaud 's syndrome , bradycardia , hypotension , heart failure , heart block , fatigue , dizziness , alopecia ( hair loss ) , abnormal vision , hallucinations , insomnia , nightmares , sexual dysfunction , erectile dysfunction and/or alteration of glucose and lipid metabolism due to the high penetration across the blood–brain barrier , lipophilic beta blockers , such as propranolol and metoprolol , are more likely than other less lipophilic beta blockers to cause sleep disturbances , such as insomnia , vivid dreams and nightmares adverse effects associated with β 2 -adrenergic receptor antagonist activity ( bronchospasm , peripheral vasoconstriction , alteration of glucose and lipid metabolism ) are less common with β 1 -selective ( often termed '' cardioselective '' ) agents , but receptor selectivity diminishes at higher doses beta-adrenoceptor antagonists ( beta-blockers ) ; a 2007 study revealed diuretics and beta blockers used for hypertension increase a patient 's risk of developing diabetes mellitus , while ace inhibitors and angiotensin ii receptor antagonists ( angiotensin receptor blockers ) actually decrease the risk of diabetes clinical guidelines in great britain , but not in the united states , call for avoiding diuretics and beta blockers as first-line treatment of hypertension due to the risk of diabetes the 2007 national heart , lung , and blood institute ( nhlbi ) asthma guidelines recommend against the use of non-selective beta blockers in asthmatics , while allowing for the use of cardioselective beta blockers unless a pacemaker is present , beta-blockers can severely depress conduction in the av node , resulting in a reduction of heart rate and cardiac output glucagon , used in the treatment of overdose , increases the strength of heart contractions , increases intracellular camp , and decreases renal vascular resistance that is , they reduce the effect of excitement or physical exertion on heart rate and force of contraction , and also tremor , and breakdown of glycogen also referred to as intrinsic sympathomimetic effect , this term is used particularly with beta-blockers that can show both agonism and antagonism at a given beta receptor , depending on the concentration of the agent ( beta-blocker ) and the concentration of the antagonized agent ( usually an endogenous compound , such as norepinephrine ) agents with intrinsic sympathomimetic action ( isa ) acebutolol , pindolol , labetalol , mepindolol , oxprenolol , celiprolol , penbutolol agents organized by lipid solubility ( lipophilicity ) high lipophilicity : propranolol , labetalol intermediate lipophilicity : metoprolol , bisoprolol , carvedilol , acebutolol , timolol , pindolol low lipophilicity ( also known as hydrophilic beta-blockers ) : atenolol , nadolol , and sotalol agents with membrane stabilizing effect carvedilol , propranolol > oxprenolol > labetalol , metoprolol , timolol agents specifically labeled for cardiac arrhythmia esmolol , sotalol , landiolol ( japan ) agents specifically labeled for congestive heart failure bisoprolol , carvedilol , metoprolol agents specifically labeled for glaucoma betaxolol , carteolol , levobunolol , timolol , metipranolol agents specifically labeled for myocardial infarction atenolol , metoprolol ( immediate release ) , propranolol ( immediate release ) , timolol , carvedilol ( after left ventricular dysfunction ) , bisoprolol ( preventive treatment before and primary treatment after heart attacks ) agents specifically labeled for migraine prophylaxis timolol , propranolol propranolol is the only agent indicated for the control of tremor , portal hypertension , and esophageal variceal bleeding , and used in conjunction with α-blocker therapy in phaeochromocytoma
