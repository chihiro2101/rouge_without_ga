vortices form from stirred fluids : they might be observed in smoke rings , whirlpools , in the wake of a boat or the winds around a tornado or dust devil mathematically , the vorticity is defined as the curl ( or rotational ) of the velocity field of the fluid , usually denoted by \vec \omega and expressed by the vector analysis formula \nabla \times \vec , where is the limiting pressure infinitely far from the axis a key concept in the dynamics of vortices is the vorticity , a vector that describes the local rotary motion at a point in the fluid , as would be perceived by an observer that moves along with it the direction of the vorticity vector is defined to be the direction of the axis of rotation of this imaginary ball ( according to the right-hand rule ) while its length is twice the ball 's angular velocity it is only through dissipation of a vortex due to viscosity that a vortex line can end in the fluid , rather than at the boundary of the fluid image : crow instability contrail.jpg thumb the crow instability of a jet aeroplane 's contrail visually demonstrates the vortex created in the atmosphere ( gas fluid medium ) by the passage of the aircraft two or more vortices that are approximately parallel and circulating in the same direction will attract and eventually merge to form a single vortex , whose circulation will equal the sum of the circulations of the constituent vortices optical vortices video of two water vortex rings colliding ( mpeg ) chapter 3 rotational flows : circulation and turbulence vortical flow research lab ( mit ) â€“ study of flows found in nature and part of the department of ocean engineering . the lifting force of aircraft wings , propeller blades , sails , and other airfoils can be explained by the creation of a vortex superimposed on the flow of air past the wing conceptually , the vorticity could be observed by placing a tiny rough ball at the point in question , free to move with the fluid , and observing how it rotates about its center in particular , the fluid in the core ( and matter trapped by it ) tends to remain in the core as the vortex moves about as long as the effects of viscosity and diffusion are negligible , the fluid in a moving vortex is carried along with it in the dynamics of fluid , a vortex is fluid that revolves around the axis line aerodynamic drag can be explained in large part by the formation of vortices in the surrounding fluid that carry away energy from the moving body
