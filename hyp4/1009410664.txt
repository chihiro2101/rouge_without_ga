the first group to use the term free zone was in the organization founded by the captain of the apollo flagship and second-deputy commodore of the sea org , captain bill robertson , in mid-1982 , which is now known as '' ron 's org '' in several countries ron hubbard , which robertson later expressed in the '' free zone decree '' , which he said was an official decree of '' galactic central - grand council '' which was '' relayed from mainship sector 9 '' : the planet known as teegeeack - local dialect '' earth '' or terra - sun 12 , sector 9 , is hereby declared a free zone the free zone group ron 's org says that the verfassungsschutz baden-württemberg ( state office for the protection of the constitution ) has stated that there is no need to keep ron 's org under observation '' as the ron 's org has no anti-constitutional goals '' maybe it makes you feel more confident , for example , if you learn that the office for safeguarding the constitution ( verfassungsschutz ) of the german state of baden-wurttemberg has stated years ago that the ron ’ s org is not a part of the church of scientology and that there is no need to observe them as the ron ’ s org has no anti-constitutional goals the church labels all practitioners of and believers in scientology without its sanction '' squirrels '' —a term hubbard coined to describe those who alter scientology technology or practice it in a nonstandard fashion additionally , scientology critics in the freezone movement have claimed that alterations have been made to hubbard ’ s original writings in church policies and even more so in technical bulletins , with parishioners never made aware of the changes to these writings also as of 2016 , the church removed the bulk of the scientology technical bulletins , known as the '' tech volumes , '' a republished and expanded edition of the 1975 issue of technical bulletins in 1991 , from all course rooms worldwide with the omission of the scientology technical volumes , the final act of subrogation has begun by the church 's non-scientologist board members into a real estate acquisition firm completely , based on parishioners donations in their entirety of payment for new buildings and their contents , not the church 's own funds ergo , the church no longer practices hubbards intent of delivering scientology , but is a firm collecting donations for its own profit , not to aid parishioners in hubbard 's original intent of scientology providing spiritual freedom in the form of new technology of the mind for all , at a non-exorbant cost ) these organizations , once paid for by parishioner donations to the '' ideal org program '' ( a perversion of a hubbard policy of the same name in the data series policy letters as well as lrh executive directive 339r '' the lrh birthday game '' ) , the orgs themselves are then charged rent by the mother organization , the cos , and further the cst ( the senior organization in charge of the cos in 2000 , the religious technology center unsuccessfully attempted to gain the internet domain name scientologie.org from the wipo ( world intellectual property organization ; one of the 16 specialized agencies of the united nations ) , in a legal action against the free zone in support of this they cite hubbard himself : dianetics is not in any way covered by legislation anywhere , for no law can prevent one man sitting down and telling another man his troubles , and if anyone wants a monopoly on dianetics , be assured that he wants it for reasons which have to do not with dianetics but with profit ron hubbard , dianetics : the modern science of mental health ( 1950 ) if i have fought for a quarter of a century , most of it alone , to keep this work from serving to uphold the enslavers of man , to keep it free from some destructive '' pitch '' or slant , then you certainly can carry that motif a little further one free zone scientologist , identified as '' safe '' , was quoted in salon as saying : '' the church of scientology does not want its control over its members to be found out by the public and it does n't want its members to know that they can get scientology outside of the church of scientology '' ” the '' ron 's org committee '' ( roc ) and the '' true source scientology foundation '' ( stss , '' stichting true source scientology '' ) have documented the argument that scientology materials written by l american businessman , don a.purcell ( junior ) , founded an early dianetics organization which had a tentative claim on the dianetics trademark , joined synergetics and allegedly returned the dianetics and hasi trademarks ownership to hubbard when hubbard was forced by purcell 's lawyers to close the failed wichita dianetics foundation in a civil legal dispute over unpaid organisational bills and lawyers fees was settled 'out of court ' amicably in 1954 in the us
