image : lovell telescope 1.jpg thumb upright the lovell telescope the '' mark i '' telescope , now known as the lovell telescope , was the world 's largest steerable dish radio telescope , in diameter , when it was constructed in 1957 ; it is now the third largest , after the green bank telescope in west virginia and the effelsberg telescope in germany at the 43rd session of the unesco world heritage committee in baku on 7 july 2019 , the jodrell bank observatory was adopted as a world heritage site on the basis of 4 criteria criterion ( i ) : jodrell bank observatory is a masterpiece of human creative genius related to its scientific and technical achievements lovell , jodrell bank telescopes none of the proposed telescopes was constructed , although design studies were carried out and scale models were made , partly because of the changing political climate , partly to the financial constraints of astronomical research in the uk and it became necessary to upgrade the lovell telescope to the mark ia , which overran in terms of cost criterion ( ii ) : jodrell bank observatory represents an important interchange of human values over a span of time and on a global scale on developments criterion ( iv ) : jodrell bank observatory represents an outstanding example of a technological ensemble which illustrates a significant stage in human history criterion ( vi ) : jodrell bank observatory is directly and tangibly associated with events and ideas of outstanding universal significance . lovell , the story of jodrell bank the site was first used for astrophysics in 1945 , when bernard lovell used some equipment left over from world war ii , including a gun laying radar , to investigate cosmic rays 277–280 observations of astrophysical masers around star formation and giant stars ; observations of pulsars ( including the discovery of millisecond pulsars and the first pulsar in a globular cluster ) ; observations of quasars and gravitational lenses ( including the detection of the first gravitational lens lovell , astronomer by chance , pp tracking space probes only took a fraction of the lovell telescope 's observing time and the remainder used for scientific observations including using radar to measure the distance to the moon and to venus ; lovell , out of the zenith , pp the project , which aimed to replace the microwave links between jodrell bank and a number of other radio telescopes with high-bandwidth fibre-optic cables , greatly increasing the sensitivity of observations , was seen as critical to the survival of the facility it includes an entrance building , the planet pavilion , a space pavilion for exhibitions and events , a glass-walled cafe with a view of the lovell telescope and an outdoor dining area , an education space , and landscaped gardens including the galaxy maze grade i is the highest of the three grades of listing , and is applied to buildings that are of '' exceptional interest '' , and grade & nbsp ; ii , the lowest grade , is applied to buildings '' of special interest '' jodrell bank has been involved with very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) since the late 1960s ; the lovell telescope took part in the first transatlantic interferometer experiment in 1968 , with other telescopes at algonquin and penticton in canada the mark iii telescope , the same size as the mark ii , was constructed to be transportable palmer and rowson ( 1968 ) but it was never moved from wardle , near nantwich , where it was used as part of merlin the jodrell bank centre for astrophysics , of which the observatory is a part , is one of the largest astrophysics research groups in the uk a 50 & nbsp ; ft ( 15 & nbsp ; m ) alt-azimuth dish was constructed in 1964 for astronomical research and to track the zond 1 , zond 2 , ranger 6 and ranger 7 space probes and apollo 11 when the 42 & nbsp ; ft was installed , a smaller dish , the '' 7 & nbsp ; m '' ( actually 6.4 m , or 21 & nbsp ; ft , in diameter ) was installed and is used for undergraduate teaching on 3 march 2008 , it was reported that britain 's science and technology facilities council ( stfc ) , faced with an £80 million shortfall in its budget , was considering withdrawing its planned £2.7 million annual funding of jodrell bank 's e-merlin project about half of the research of the group is in the area of radio astronomy—including research into pulsars , the cosmic microwave background radiation , gravitational lenses , active galaxy and astrophysical masers the observatory is the site of several episodes in the novel boneland , by alan garner ( 2012 ) , and the central character , colin whisterfield , is an astrophysicist on its staff the array consists of up to seven radio telescopes and includes the lovell telescope , the mark ii , cambridge , defford , knockin , darnhall , and pickmere ( previously known as tabley ) a path around the lovell telescope is approximately 20 & nbsp ; m from the telescope 's outer railway , information boards explain how the telescope works and the research that is done with it the observatory has been involved in the construction of several cosmic microwave background experiments , including the tenerife experiment , which ran from the 1980s to 2000 , and the amplifiers and cryostats for the very small array on the same date five other buildings on the site were designated at grade ii ; namely the searchlight telescope , the control building , the park royal building , the electrical workshop , and the link hut the mark va was similar to the mark v but with a smaller dish of and a design using prestressed concrete , similar to the mark ii ( the previous two designs more closely resembled the lovell telescope ) the array is run from jodrell bank on behalf of the science and technology facilities council as a national facility at a wavelength of 6 & nbsp ; cm ( 5 & nbsp ; ghz frequency ) , merlin has a resolution of 50 & nbsp ; milliarcseconds which is comparable to that of the hst at optical wavelengths 4–5 it discovered radio noise from the great nebula in andromeda—the first definite detection of an extragalactic radio source—and the remains of tycho 's supernova in the radio frequency ; at the time it had not been discovered by optical astronomy it had a circular 50 & nbsp ; ft ( 15.2 & nbsp ; m ) dish on a polar mount , lovell , jodrell bank telescopes , p jodrell bank has been mentioned in several works of fiction , including doctor who ( the tenth planet , remembrance of the daleks , '' the poison sky '' , '' the eleventh hour '' , '' spyfall '' ) and '' birthday boy '' by david baddiel image : jodrell bank mark ii.jpg thumb the mark ii radio telescope the mark ii is an elliptical radio telescope , with a major axis and a minor axis of 67–68 the lovell telescope and the mark ii telescopes are regularly used for vlbi with telescopes across europe ( the european vlbi network ) , giving a resolution of around 0.001 arcseconds when the antenna was turned by 90 degrees at the maximum of the shower , the number of detections dropped to the background level , proving that the transient signals detected by radar were from meteors after an accident that irreparably damaged the 50 & nbsp ; ft telescope 's surface , it was demolished in 1982 and replaced with a more accurate telescope , the '' 42 & nbsp ; ft '' on 23 july 2012 , elbow performed live at the observatory and filmed a documentary of the event and the facility which was released as a live cd/dvd of the concert
