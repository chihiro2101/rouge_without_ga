this would result in an expansion of the city into the former swamp between metairie/gentilly ridges and the lakefront he was the france minister of the marine , chancellor , and controller-general of finances during the reign of france 's '' sun king '' , louis xiv , for whom the colony of was named on september 24 , 2005 , hurricane rita did not breach the temporary repairs in the main part of the city , but the repair on the industrial canal wall in the lower 9th ward was breached , allowing about of water back into that neighborhood due to cost concerns , the levees were built to protect against only a category 3 hurricane ; however , some of the levees initially withstood the category 5 storm surge of hurricane katrina ( august 2005 ) , which only slowed to category 3 winds within hours of landfall ( due to a last-minute eyewall replacement cycle ) congress failed to fully fund an upgrade requested during the 1990s by the army corps of engineers , and funding was cut in 2003–04 despite a 2001 study by the federal emergency management agency warning that a hurricane in new orleans was one of the country 's three most likely disasters wind pushes water into the lake from the gulf of mexico as a hurricane approaches from the south , and from there it can spill into new orleans image : lake pontchartrain georges.jpg thumb upright 1.25 lake pontchartrain at new orleans during hurricane georges in 1998 ;
