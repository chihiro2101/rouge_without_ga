a small area near ( modern ) rostov-on-don , in southern russia , may have been a centre for ritual trepanning , around 6000 years ago , according to archeologists who discovered remains of eight recipients of the practice , within a small area , all with the incision in the unusual obelion position , high on the back of the head the list includes ( 1 ) rectangular intersecting cuts ; ( 2 ) scraping utilizing an abrasive instrument such as flint ; ( 3 ) circular grooving ; ( 4 ) boring and cutting by a circular trephine or crown saw ; ( 5 ) burr hole done by drilling several circle holes closely to create a space and then cut/chisel the bone between the hole in the more recent times of postclassical pre-columbian mesoamerica , evidence for the practice of trepanation and an assortment of other cranial deformation techniques comes from a variety of sources , including physical cranial remains of burials , allusions in iconographic artworks and reports from the post-colonial period out of eight skulls with trepanations from the 6th to 8th centuries found in southwestern germany , seven skulls show clear evidence of healing and survival after trepanation , suggesting that the survival rate of the operations was high and the infection rate was low the procedure comes with severe repercussions such as direct or indirect perioperative complications , which include increased damage to the brain , infection , blood loss , hemorrhage , and potentially death due to the trauma as the skull 's protective covering is compromised inferring the events to represent experiments on people until they died , the study interpreted that use of trepanation as an indicator of the stressful sociopolitical climate that not long thereafter resulted in the abandonment of monte alban as the primary regional administrative center in the oaxacan highlands the prefrontal leucotomy , a precursor to lobotomy , was performed by cutting a trephine hole into the skull , inserting an instrument , and destroying parts of the brain in ancient times , trepanation instruments were less complex , and were commonly made out of flint , obsidian , or harder material such as stone knives , and later with metal such as bronze and copper the archaeological record in mesoamerica is further complicated by the practice of skull mutilation and modification carried out after the death of the subject , to fashion '' trophy skulls '' and the like of captives and enemies instead , the pre-columbian maya apparently used an abrasive technique that ground away at the back of the skull , thinning the bone and sometimes perforating it , similar to the examples from cholula a study of ten low-status burials from the late classic period at monte albán concluded that the trepanation had been applied non-therapeutically , and , since multiple techniques had been used and since some people had received more than one trepanation , concluded it had been done experimentally at last ! feilding also performed a self-trepanation with a drill , while mellen shot the operation for the short film '' heartbeat in the brain '' , which was long thought to have been lost however , in 2007 , han and chen from the institute of archeology , chinese academy of social sciences looked at six trepanned skulls spanning between the neolithic period through the bronze and iron ages ( around 5000–2000 years ago ) found in five different locations there is evidence of bone remodelling around the skull defects , corroborated by the smooth borders around the opening , sealed by a dense cortex of bone , denoting procedural success after trepanation trepanation is perhaps the oldest surgical procedure for which there is archaeological evidence , and in some areas may have been quite widespread a prominent proponent of the modern view is peter halvorson , who drilled a hole in the front of his own skull to increase '' brain blood volume '' trepanation is a treatment used for epidural and subdural hematomas , and surgical access for certain other neurosurgical procedures , such as intracranial pressure monitoring the perforations were found with the growth of fine bone spurs , which indicate that trepanation had been carried out on live subjects , rather than being a ritual conducted after death additionally , the procedure was done by shamans or witch doctors utilizing tumi ( ceremonial knife in early peru ) , sharpened seashells ( south pacific ) , a trephine drill , bronze knife , etc the only known female with a trepanned skull , shown signs of bone spurs growth and retraction of the edges suggest that she also survived the surgery as early as 7000 years ago , one of the alternative medicine practice was boring holes in the patient 's neurocranium with the aim to cure and not to kill the skull , which belonged to an adult male , exhibited a right parietal calvarial defect ( 31 x 25 & nbsp ; mm ) with evidence of scraping by a trephine-like tool in 2000 , two men from cedar city , utah , were prosecuted for practicing medicine without a license after they performed a trepanation on an english woman to treat her chronic fatigue syndrome and depression
