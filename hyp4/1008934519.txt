a cloud blocking the sun ) can also interfere with the desired results , by producing one or more hdr layers that do have the luminosity expected by an automated hdr system , though one might still be able to produce a reasonable hdr image manually in software by rearranging the image layers to merge in order of their actual luminosity this is an example of four standard dynamic range images that are combined to produce three resulting tone mapped images : original images image : stlouisarchmultexpev-4.72.jpg –4 stops image : stlouisarchmultexpev-1.82.jpg –2 stops image : stlouisarchmultexpev+1.51.jpg +2 stops image : stlouisarchmultexpev+4.09.jpg +4 stops results after processing file : stlouisarchmultexpcdr.jpg simple contrast reduction file : stlouisarchmultexptonemapped.jpg local tone mapping file : stlouisarchmultexpev sns-hdr.jpg alt natural tone mapping natural tone mapping this is an example of a scene with a very wide dynamic range : source images image : hdri sample scene window - 01.jpg –6 ev image : hdri sample scene window - 02.jpg –5 ev image : hdri sample scene window - 03.jpg –4 ev image : hdri sample scene window - 04.jpg –3 ev image : hdri sample scene window - 05.jpg –2 ev image : hdri sample scene window - 06.jpg –1 ev image : hdri sample scene window - 07.jpg 0 ev image : hdri sample scene window - 08.jpg +1 ev image : hdri sample scene window - 09.jpg +2 ev image : hdri sample scene window - 10.jpg +3 ev image : hdri sample scene window - 11.jpg +4 ev image : hdri sample scene window - 12.jpg +5 ev results after processing image : hdri sample scene window.jpg natural tone mapping a fast-moving subject ( or unsteady camera ) will result in a '' ghost '' effect or a staggered-blur strobe effect , as a result of the merged images not being identical , but each capturing the moving subject at a different moment in time , with its position changed global hdr was first introduced in 1993 '' compositing multiple pictures of the same scene '' , by steve mann , in is & t 's 46th annual conference , cambridge , massachusetts , may 9–14 , 1993 resulting in a mathematical theory of differently exposed pictures of the same subject matter that was published in 1995 by steve mann and rosalind picard georges cornuéjols and licensees of his patents ( brdi , hymatom ) introduced the principle of hdr video image , in 1986 , by interposing a matricial lcd screen in front of the camera 's image sensor , increasing the sensors dynamic by five stops however , when the appropriate transfer function is used , hdr pixels for some applications can be represented with a color depth that has as few as 10–12 & nbsp ; bits for luminance and 8 & nbsp ; bits for chrominance without introducing any visible quantization artifacts modern hdr imaging uses a completely different approach , based on making a high-dynamic-range luminance or light map using only global image operations ( across the entire image ) , and then tone mapping the result also in 1991 , georges cornuéjols introduced the hdr+ image principle by non-linear accumulation of images to increase the sensitivity of the camera : for low-light environments , several successive images are accumulated , thus increasing the signal to noise ratio in 1991 , the first commercial video camera was introduced that performed real-time capturing of multiple images with different exposures , and producing an hdr video image , by hymatom , licensee of georges cornuéjols the advent of consumer digital cameras produced a new demand for hdr imaging to improve the light response of digital camera sensors , which had a much smaller dynamic range than film le gray used one negative for the sky , and another one with a longer exposure for the sea , and combined the two into one picture in positive the image took five days to reproduce the tonal range of the scene , which ranges from a bright lamp ( relative to the scene ) to a dark shadow for example , a sensor for 30fps video will give out 60fps with the odd frames at a short exposure time and the even frames at a longer exposure time some of the sensors on modern phones and cameras may even combine the two images on-chip so that a wider dynamic range without in-pixel compression is directly available to the user for display or processing .
