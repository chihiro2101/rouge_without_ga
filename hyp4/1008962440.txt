) using this guideline , to achieve the 80-bit strength recommended for high security ( non-military ) by nist , a passphrase would need to be 58 characters long , assuming a composition that includes uppercase and alphanumeric if the words or components of a passphrase may be found in a language dictionary—especially one available as electronic input to a software program—the passphrase is rendered more vulnerable to dictionary attack however , the required effort ( in time and cost ) can be made impracticably high if there are enough words in the passphrase and how randomly they are chosen and ordered in the passphrase joseph bonneau , ekaterina shutova , linguistic properties of multi-word passphrases , university of cambridge for example , the widely used cryptography standard openpgp requires that a user make up a passphrase that must be entered whenever decrypting or signing messages in 2012 , two cambridge university researchers analyzed passphrases from the amazon payphrase system and found that a significant percentage are easy to guess due to common cultural references such as movie names and sports teams , losing much of the potential of using long passwords when used in cryptography , commonly the password protects a long ( machine generated ) key , and the key protects the data typical advice about choosing a passphrase includes suggestions that it should be : long enough to be hard to guess not a famous quotation from literature , holy books , et cetera hard to guess by intuition—even by someone who knows the user well easy to remember and type accurately for better security , any easily memorable encoding at the user 's own level can be applied one method to create a strong passphrase is to use dice to select words at random from a long list , a technique often referred to as diceware while such a collection of words might appear to violate the '' not from any dictionary '' rule , the security is based entirely on the large number of possible ways to choose from the list of words and not from any secrecy about the words themselves including it in , now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country , might produce , now is the time for all good tqbfjotld to come to the aid of their country as the passphrase if backward compatibility with microsoft lan manager is not needed , in versions of windows nt ( including windows 2000 , windows xp and later ) , a passphrase can be used as a substitute for a windows password
