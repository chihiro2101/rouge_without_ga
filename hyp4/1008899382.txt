in 1937 , pure oil company ( now chevron corporation ) and its partner superior oil company ( now part of exxonmobil corporation ) used a fixed platform to develop a field in of water , one mile ( 1.6 & nbsp ; km ) offshore of calcasieu parish , louisiana in 1945 , concern for american control of its offshore oil reserves caused president harry truman to issue an executive order unilaterally extending american territory to the edge of its continental shelf , an act that effectively ended the 3-mile limit '' freedom of the seas '' regime but it was kerr-mcgee oil industries ( now part of occidental petroleum ) , as operator for partners phillips petroleum ( conocophillips ) and stanolind oil & gas ( bp ) , that completed its historic ship shoal block 32 well in october 1947 , months before superior actually drilled a discovery from their vermilion platform farther offshore when offshore drilling moved into deeper waters of up to , fixed platform rigs were built , until demands for drilling equipment was needed in the to depth of the gulf of mexico , the first jackup rig began appearing from specialized offshore drilling contractors such as forerunners of ensco international the concept of an anchored , stable floating deep-sea platform had been designed and tested back in the 1920s by edward robert armstrong for the purpose of operating aircraft with an invention known as the '' seadrome '' as of june , 2010 , there were over 620 mobile offshore drilling rigs ( jackups , semisubs , drillships , barges ) available for service in the competitive rig fleet notable offshore fields include : the north sea the gulf of mexico ( offshore texas , louisiana , mississippi , alabama and florida ) california ( in the los angeles basin and santa barbara channel , part of the ventura basin ) the caspian sea ( notably some major fields offshore azerbaijan ) the campos and santos basins off the coasts of brazil newfoundland and nova scotia ( atlantic canada ) several fields off west africa most notably west of nigeria and angola offshore fields in south east asia and sakhalin , russia major offshore oil fields are located in the persian gulf such as safaniya , manifa and marjan which belong to saudi arabia and are developed by saudi aramco fields in india ( mumbai high , k g basin-east coast of india , tapti field , gujarat , india ) the taranaki basin in new zealand the kara sea north of siberia the arctic ocean off the coasts of alaska and canada 's northwest territories the offshore fields in the adriatic sea these platforms are built on concrete or steel legs , or both , anchored directly onto the seabed , supporting the deck with space for drilling rigs , production facilities and crew quarters offshore concrete structure , pioneered by the condeep concept , often have in-built oil storage in tanks below the sea surface and these tanks were often used as a flotation capability , allowing them to be built close to shore ( norway fjords and scotland firths are popular because they are sheltered and deep enough ) and then floated to their final position where they are sunk to the seabed they are generally anchored by combinations of chain , wire rope or polyester rope , or both , during drilling and/or production operations , though they can also be kept in place by the use of dynamic positioning jack-up mobile drilling units ( or jack-ups ) , as the name suggests , are rigs that can be jacked up above the sea using legs that can be lowered , much like jacks they are designed to move from place to place , and then anchor themselves by deploying their legs to the ocean bottom using a rack and pinion gear system on each leg it is most often used for exploratory drilling of new oil or gas wells in deep water but can also be used for scientific drilling to position the gbs during installation , the gbs may be connected to either a transportation barge or any other barge ( provided it is large enough to support the gbs ) using strand jacks spars have to-date been designed in three configurations : the '' conventional '' one-piece cylindrical hull ; the '' truss spar '' , in which the midsection is composed of truss elements connecting the upper buoyant hull ( called a hard tank ) with the bottom soft tank containing permanent ballast ; and the '' cell spar '' , which is built from multiple vertical cylinders it also has the ability , by adjusting the mooring line tensions ( using chain-jacks attached to the mooring lines ) , to move horizontally and to position itself over wells at some distance from the main platform location they are designed to operate in conjunction with a static production platform which is connected to the platform by flow lines or by umbilical cable , or both the hibernia platform in canada is the world 's largest ( in terms of weight ) offshore platform , located on the jeanne d'arc basin , in the atlantic ocean off the coast of newfoundland a typical oil production platform is self-sufficient in energy and water needs , housing electrical generation , water desalinators and all of the equipment necessary to process oil and gas such that it can be either delivered directly onshore by pipeline or to a floating platform or tanker loading facility , or both during normal operations , psvs ( platform supply vessels ) keep the platforms provisioned and supplied , and ahts vessels can also supply them , as well as tow them to location and serve as standby rescue and firefighting vessels the following also are not names officially recognized in the industry : oim ( offshore installation manager ) who is the ultimate authority during his/her shift and makes the essential decisions regarding the operation of the platform ; operations team leader ( otl ) ; offshore methods engineer ( ome ) who defines the installation methodology of the platform ; offshore operations engineer ( ooe ) who is the senior technical authority on the platform ; pstl or operations coordinator for managing crew changes ; dynamic positioning operator , navigation , ship or vessel maneuvering ( modu ) , station keeping , fire and gas systems operations in the event of incident ; automation systems specialist , to configure , maintain and troubleshoot the process control systems ( pcs ) , process safety systems , emergency support systems and vessel management systems ; second mate to meet manning requirements of flag state , operates fast rescue craft , cargo operations , fire team leader ; third mate to meet manning requirements of flag state , operate fast rescue craft , cargo operations , fire team leader ; ballast control operator to operate fire and gas systems ; crane operators to operate the cranes for lifting cargo around the platform and between boats ; scaffolders to rig up scaffolding for when it is required for workers to work at height ; coxswains to maintain the lifeboats and manning them if necessary ; control room operators , especially fpso or production platforms ; catering crew , including people tasked with performing essential functions such as cooking , laundry and cleaning the accommodation ; production techs to run the production plant ; helicopter pilot ( s ) living on some platforms that have a helicopter based offshore and transporting workers to other platforms or to shore on crew changes ; maintenance technicians ( instrument , electrical or mechanical ) the resulting investigation conducted by lord cullen and publicized in the first cullen report was highly critical of a number of areas , including , but not limited to , management within the company , the design of the structure , and the permit to work system given the number of grievances and conspiracy theories that involve the oil business , and the importance of gas/oil platforms to the economy , platforms in the united states are believed to be potential terrorist targets in the gulf of mexico and offshore california , the waters around oil platforms are popular destinations for sports and commercial fishermen , because of the greater numbers of fish near the platforms the united states and brunei have active rigs-to-reefs programs , in which former oil platforms are left in the sea , either in place or towed to new locations , as permanent artificial reefs on the us pacific coast , marine biologist milton love has proposed that oil platforms off california be retained as artificial reefs , instead of being dismantled ( at great cost ) , because he has found them to be havens for many of the species of fish which are otherwise declining in the region , in the course of 11 years of research offshore oil production involves environmental risks , most notably oil spills from oil tankers or pipelines transporting oil from the platform to onshore facilities , and from leaks and accidents on the platform produced water is also generated , which is water brought to the surface along with the oil and gas ; it is usually highly saline and may include dissolved or unseparated hydrocarbons the increasing number of oil rigs also increase movement of oil tankers which also increases co2 levels which directly warm water in the zone , warm waters are a key factor for hurricanes to form while a floating system may be lower cost in deeper waters than a fixed platform , the dynamic nature of the platforms introduces many challenges for the drilling and production facilities the trend today is to conduct more of the production operations subsea , by separating water from oil and re-injecting it rather than pumping it up to a platform , or by flowing to onshore , with no installations visible above the sea subsea facilities are also easier to expand , with new separators or different modules for different oil types , and are not limited by the fixed floor space of an above-water installation non-floating compliant towers and fixed platforms , by water depth : petronius platform , baldpate platform , troll a , bullwinkle platform , pompano platform , benguela-belize lobito-tomboco platform , gullfaks c , tombua landana platform , harmony platform , list of tallest oil platforms accommodation platform chukchi cap conductor support system deep sea mining deepwater drilling drillship north sea oil offshore geotechnical engineering offshore oil and gas in the united states oil drilling protocol for the suppression of unlawful acts against the safety of fixed platforms located on the continental shelf sar201 shallow water drilling submarine pipeline tempsc texas towers oil rig disasters listing of oil rig accidents oil rig photos collection of pictures of drilling rigs and production platforms an independent review of offshore platforms in the north sea overview of conventional platforms pictorial treatment on the installation of platforms which extend from the seabed to the ocean surface
