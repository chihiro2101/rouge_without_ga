maslow 's hierarchy of needs is often portrayed in the shape of a pyramid with the largest , most fundamental needs at the bottom and the need for self-actualization and transcendence at the top maslow 's idea suggests that the most basic level of needs must be met before the individual will strongly desire ( or focus motivation upon ) the secondary or higher-level needs the human brain is a complex system and has parallel processes running at the same time , thus many different motivations from various levels of maslow 's hierarchy can occur at the same time thus maslow acknowledged the likelihood that the different levels of motivation could occur at any time in the human mind , but he focused on identifying the basic types of motivation and the order in which they would tend to be met this means that if a human is struggling to meet their physiological needs , then they are unlikely to intrinsically pursue safety , belongingness , esteem , and self-actualization and/or in the absence of economic safety – ( due to an economic crisis and lack of work opportunities ) these safety needs manifest themselves in ways such as a preference for job security , grievance procedures for protecting the individual from unilateral authority , savings accounts , insurance policies , disability accommodations , etc in contrast , for some individuals , the need for self-esteem is more important than the need for love ; and for others , the need for creative fulfillment may supersede even the most basic needs the '' lower '' version of esteem is the need for respect from others , and may include a need for status , recognition , fame , prestige , and attention self-actualization is understood as the goal or explicit motive , and the previous stages in maslow 's hierarchy fall in line to become the step-by-step process by which self-actualization is achievable ; an explicit motive is the objective of a reward-based system that is used to intrinsically drive completion of certain values or goals '' transcendence refers to the very highest and most inclusive or holistic levels of human consciousness , behaving and relating , as ends rather than means , to oneself , to significant others , to human beings in general , to other species , to nature , and to the cosmos '' as uriel abulof argues , '' the continued resonance of maslow 's theory in popular imagination , however unscientific it may seem , is possibly the single most telling evidence of its significance : it explains human nature as something that most humans immediately recognize in themselves and others maslow studied what he called the master race of people such as albert einstein , jane addams , eleanor roosevelt , and frederick douglass rather than mentally ill or neurosis people , writing that '' the study of crippled , stunted , immature , and unhealthy specimens can yield only a cripple psychology and a cripple philosophy in their extensive review of research based on maslow 's hierarchy , wahba and bridwell found little evidence for the ranking of needs that maslow described or for the existence of a definite hierarchy at all the higher-order ( self-esteem and self-actualization ) and lower-order ( physiological , safety , and love ) needs classification of maslow 's hierarchy of needs is not universal and may vary across cultures due to individual differences and availability of resources in the region or geopolitical entity/country in one study , exploratory factor analysis ( efa ) of a thirteen-item scale showed there were two particularly important levels of needs in the us during the peacetime of 1993 to 1994 : survival ( physiological and safety ) and psychological ( love , self-esteem , and self-actualization ) with regards to satisfaction of needs during the war , in the us there were three levels : physiological needs , safety needs , and psychological needs ( social , self-esteem , and self-actualization ) the researchers found that children had higher physical need scores than the other groups , the love need emerged from childhood to young adulthood , the esteem need was highest among the adolescent group , young adults had the highest self-actualization level , and old age had the highest level of security , it was needed across all levels comparably the authors argued that this suggested maslow 's hierarchy may be limited as a theory for developmental sequence since the sequence of the love need and the self-esteem need should be reversed according to age maslow 's term of self-actualization might not properly portray the full extent of this level ; quite often , when a person is at the level of self-actualization , much of what they accomplish in general may benefit others , or '' the greater good '' abulof argues that while maslow stresses that '' motivation theory must be anthropocentric rather than animalcentric , '' he posits a largely animalistic hierarchy , crowned with a human edge : '' man 's higher nature rests upon man 's lower nature , needing it as a foundation and collapsing without this foundation… our godlike qualities rest upon and need our animal qualities after all , the latter , according to maslow , constitutes '' an inner , more biological , more instinctoid core of human nature , '' thus '' the search for one 's own intrinsic , authentic values '' checks the human freedom of choice : '' a musician must make music , '' so freedom is limited to merely the choice of instrument .
