unfortunately , it was released almost a year after the game launched '' paul mason reviewed chivalry & sorcery 2nd edition for imagine magazine , and stated that '' chivalry & sorcery mistakenly attempts to compete with the ad & d game in terms of detail – a hopeless task which can only produce a fragmented and complex set of rules but as a complete campaign system , the virtues of c & s are only fully realized in the hands of the superior gamer — one who ’ s serious , sophisticated , dedicated , and familiar with medieval history , legend , and fantasy literature alongside '' classic '' spells , charms , illusions , black magick , there is a special class of magic , basic magick ( bm ) dealing with spells manipulating the four elements ( water , air , fire , earth ) and their derivatives ( ice , cold , heat , light , dark , sand , dust , rain , etc they include ( in ascending order of power ) : gargoyles , imps , balrogs , elementary of four elements , jinn of the ring , jinn of the lamp and efreet , knights of hell , fallen angel , powers , principalities and lords of hell at the top of the demonic hierarchy one of the most interesting details of the game is an opportunity for a magick user to be part of a guild or society , more or less secret , including members of their class , and sometimes other classes of magicians pursuing the same ideals and animated by the same designs the game , however , was unable to gain an increase in its already small market share and player base , in large part because of the lack of a coordinated release of supplemental products such as modules , source books , and campaign settings- most especially during the months after release , 1998 ) stated that '' it definitely uses some modern production features ( though the layout is a bit busy and plagued by typos ) , but the defining aspects of most '90s games - quick character generation , rules-lightness , storytelling not dice-rolling - are n't a part of this game '' in the september 1980 edition ( issue 4 ) , eric goldberg liked the well-researched information on the medieval period — particularly heraldry — presented in the rules , but bemoaned the complexity , saying , '' the worst problem arises when the game is actually played — it can move as awkwardly as an octopus on dry land despite the interest and realism of the system , which makes a case demonic invocations no mage can not afford to treat lightly , this part of the system has not been well integrated with the rules of magic and is confined to the end of the rules in the inaugural issue of march 1980 , greg costikyan gave the game an average score of 6 out of 9 , saying , '' although the lack of world-design rules and poor organization are sorely felt , c & s remains the best full-scale complicated frp game published to date this aspect of magic is questionable because the power of a spell will depend in some cases the level of the spell ( spells the highest levels being most powerful ) but for basic magic spells will no longer depend on the level of the spell but the magician pmf is to say its power the background was heavily influenced by medieval france and christianity , with knights ( tournaments , courtly love , fiefs , political influence ) , a hierarchical priesthood who could perform miracles , and a large section on monsters that included the infernal court of demons with c & s2 , the system was designed as a complete simulation of the middle ages in all its aspects : political , economic , and military ; enhanced by a strong fantasy element , derived mainly from the world of j although goldberg admitted that '' no frp system has since matched the quantity and quality of its technical system design '' , he did not recommend the game : '' c & s is a poor game for all but the serious devotee of fantasy '' after the relative success of the second edition c & s sank into obscurity for a number of years , mainly from the lack of support from fantasy games unlimited ( fgu ) the result was the return of some medieval references and some gameplay mechanics ( such as '' bash '' or '' targeting '' for spells ) adding this degree of realism that was lacking in the previous edition c & s3 established a system of '' skills '' which covers all areas of the game , including fighting , magic , knowledge of geography , languages , dances and songs , and other things a person is able to do or know combat in c & s attempts to be more realistic than the abstract systems of games such as d & d , though it still has the armour class and hit table concepts fantasy games unlimited & highlander design edition ) brittannia game designs and maple leaf games ltd ( c & s light and edition ) mystic station designs ( editor of supplements for c & s ed a magician 's capability is defined by their concentration level ( which depends on their characteristics , bonus astral and experience ) which determines their magick level ( mkl , the ' k ' of magick is emphasized by c & s ) as a reference work , and as a source of ideas for incorporation into other games , chivalry & sorcery is still excellent , but i doubt it will shake its popular image as a cult game on the fringes of the hobby mainstream the talent system ( called '' skillscape '' ) uses a percentile die and a 10-sided die ( d10 ) for all actions determined by talent , the d10 determining if the success ( or failure ) of talent is '' critical '' or not 3 ( 2004 ) - published by mystic station designs c & s player 's pack ( 2004 ) - published by mystic station designs c & s player 's pack volume 2 ( 2006 ) - published by mystic station designs the game master 's toolkit vol this flexible and efficient system is a decisive contribution to c & s , and led to both a simpler single resolution system for all aspects of the game and a modernistic game with an operating system talent they are similar to the elven smiths of eregion who were manipulated by sauron to make the three ( elvish ) , seven ( dwarvish ) , and nine ( mannish ) rings of power in j.r.r this avoids the anachronisms and gives a useful indication of technological advances at each period , allowing campaigns to be made more realistic ;
