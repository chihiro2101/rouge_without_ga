although the knowledge of casting soft metals in moulds was well established before johannes gutenberg 's time , his discovery of an alloy that was hard , durable , and would take a clear impression from the mould ( because it did not shrink as much as lead alone when cooled ) represents a fundamental aspect of his solution to the problem of printing with movable type ( his other contributions were the creation of inks that would adhere to metal type and a method of softening handmade printing paper so that it would take the impression well cheap , plentifully available as galena and easily workable , lead has many of the ideal characteristics , but on its own it lacks the necessary hardness and does not make castings with sharp details because molten lead shrinks and sags when it cools to a solid after much experimentation it was found that adding pewterer 's tin , obtained from cassiterite , improved the ability of the cast type to withstand the wear and tear of the printing process , making it tougher but not more brittle despite patiently trying different proportions of both metals , solving the second part of the type metal problem proved very difficult without the addition of yet a third metal , antimony the addition of antimony conferred the much needed improvements in the properties of hardness , wear resistance and especially , the sharpness of reproduction of the type design , given that it has the curious property of diminishing the shrinkage of the alloy upon solidification type metal is an alloy of lead , tin and antimony in different proportions depending on the application , be it individual character mechanical casting for hand setting , mechanical line casting or individual character mechanical typesetting and stereo plate casting the proportions used are in the range : lead 50‒86 % , antimony 11‒30 % and tin 3‒20 % pure lead is a relatively cheap metal , is soft thus easy to work , and it is easy to cast since it melts at tin ( sn ) it promotes the fluidity of the molten alloy and makes the type tough , giving the alloy resistance to wear fry 's metal foundries , printing metals , great britain , revised edition 1966 when alloyed with lead to produce type metal , antimony gives it the hardness it needs to resist deformation during printing , and gives it sharper castings from the mould to produce clear , easily read printed text on the page the actual compositions differed over time , different machines were adjusted to different alloys depending on the intended uses of the type type metal should produce a true and sharp cast , and reproduce the matrix in all detail type metal should be easy to cast , this means : a reasonable low melting point , iron should not dissolve in the molten metal , mould and nozzles should stay clean and easy to maintain the molten metal should be clean , while molten it should give as little dross as possible , to prevent loss of tin and antimony the economics have to be taken in account too : keeping the costs down would mean : keeping the content of tin and antimony as low as possible , and maintaining a high quality of the type produced the addition of a small amount of antimony ( 5 % to 6 % ) to lead will significantly alter the alloy 's behavior compared to pure lead : although the melting point of pure antimony is 630 & nbsp ; °c , this mixture will be completely molten and a homogeneous fluid even at temperatures as low as 371 & nbsp ; °c eutectic alloys are used on linotype-machines and ludlow-casters to prevent blockage of the mould and to ensure continuous trouble-free casting monotype machines however can utilize a wide range of different alloys ; maintaining a constant and a high production meant a strict standardization of the typemetal in the company , so as to reduce by all means any interruption of the production alloys with a high-content of antimony , and subsequently a high content of tin , can be cast at a higher temperature , and at a lower speed and with more cooling at a monotype composition or supercaster the same applies to aluminium , although this metal will float on top of the melt , and will be easily discovered and removed , before it is dissolved into the lead xli , summer 1957 , nr.1 some tin was added to the alloy for casting small characters and narrow spaces , to better fill narrow areas of the mould
