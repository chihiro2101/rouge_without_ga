knowing it will be only a matter of time before he is forced to reveal the details of the blackmail scheme and farr 's role , barrett hangs himself in a police cell the fact that willing participants in consensual homosexual acts could be prosecuted made them vulnerable to entrapment , and the criminalisation of homosexuality was known as the '' blackmailer 's charter '' scriptwriter janet green had previously collaborated with basil dearden on a british '' social problem '' film , sapphire , which had dealt with racism against afro-caribbean immigrants to the united kingdom in the late 1950s the audience is allowed just one glimpse of a photo of two heads : farr and barrett seen from the obverse of the print , and the screenplay underscores the fact that only barrett 's tears suggest anything untoward , along with the breaking of social taboos in that they are different classes and far apart in age relph and dearden acknowledged that the film was designed to be '' an open protest against britain 's law that being a homosexual is a criminal act '' an official of the british board of film censors ( bbfc ) had set out its view of homosexuality in film : '' to the great majority of cinema-goers , homosexuality is outside their direct experience and is something which is shocking , distasteful and disgusting '' relph said that in victim , by contrast : '' what i think we want to say is that the homosexual , although subject to a psychological or glandular variation from sexual normality , is a human being subject to all the emotions of other human beings , and as deserving of our understanding third , the film implies that homosexuality is a choice , which '' is a dangerous idea to put into the minds of adolescents who see the film '' in the united states , the motion picture association of america 's production code administration , the film industry 's self-censorship board that enforced the guidelines established by the motion picture production code , denied victim its seal of approval a spokesperson cited the film 's '' candid and clinical discussion of homosexuality '' and its '' overtly expressed pleas for social acceptance of the homosexual , to the extent that he be made socially tolerable '' a few years before the release of victim , the filmmakers of suddenly , last summer ( 1959 ) had persuaded the code censors to allow their film to use homosexuality as a plot device , but only by presenting it through cryptic innuendos , and film had to illustrate the '' horrors of such a lifestyle '' victim , in contrast , was deemed to be too frank in its treatment of homosexuality , and not initially approved by the censorship code it was the only british entry in the venice film festival in 1961 , where an italian critic commented : '' at last the british have stopped being hypocrites '' an anonymous reviewer in the times commented that '' victim may not say a great deal about '' the related issues of the nature of 'love ' and gay men 's '' genuine feeling '' for each other , '' but what it does say is reasoned and just ; and it does invite a compassionate consideration of this particular form of human bondage '' however the sight and sound reviewer terence kelly saw problems with the film , and wrote that victim contains '' a tour of the more respectable parts of the london homosexual underworld , with glimpses of the ways in which different men cope with or are destroyed by their abnormality '' '' chris waters however has argued that '' victim took for granted that homosexuality was a social problem that needed to be explored calmly and dispassionately '' as a result of the '' wake of the social dislocations associated with the war and the various anxieties to which they gave rise '' he elaborates on this further by referring to kenneth soddy , a physician at the department of psychological medicine at university college london hospital , who wrote in 1954 that whilst homosexuality itself did n't trouble the community , its '' social disturbance '' during the war caused '' variations in social and sexual practices which engenders attacks of acute public anxiety , a news report in the new york times described victim as a political work : '' the movie is a dramatized condemnation , based on the wolfenden report , of britain 's laws on homosexuality '' in relation to a bfi southbank retrospective screening season of bogarde 's films , peter bradshaw argues that fifty years on , victim does not function necessarily '' as a study of homosexuality , '' but rather of '' blackmail and paranoia he argues bogarde 's lighting is more haunting than necessary in the confrontation scenes with his wife , and references the work of patrick hamilton , which often depicted '' the seedy , nasty world of pubs and drinking holes around london 's west end '' , seen throughout the film that add to '' the strange , occult world of blackmail , conspiracy and shame , and the seediness of a certain type of london , that victim holds up best alan burton has also highlighted that in spite of attracting '' much criticism and debate , largely in terms of its liberal prescriptions and its ‘ timid ’ handling of a controversial theme '' , confirmed in that a study that victim had '' significant impact on gay men who struggled with their identity and subjectivity at a time when their sexuality was potentially illegal '' the film was not a major hit , but it was popular , and by 1971 , it had earned an estimated profit of £51,762 it was commissioned by the producers and was a typical way of marketing a film in the era before home video in july 2017 , marking the 50th anniversary of the sexual offences act , bbc radio 3 broadcast a play dramatising the making of the film , with ed stoppard as bogarde .
