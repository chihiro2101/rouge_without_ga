star control is a combination of a strategy game and real-time one-on-one ship combat simulator there is a planet in the middle of the battlefield , providing a centre of gravity , which players can either crash into , or glide nearby to gain momentum but the idea was , your fleet of ships , your selection of ships in total was as strong as someone else 's , and then , it came down to which matchup did you find '' the team would begin with paper illustrations , followed by logical abilities for those ships , and a character concept that suited the ship 's look-and-feel these antagonists would be called the ur-quan , with a motivation to dominate the galaxy to hunt for slaves , and an appearance based on a national geographic image of a predatory caterpillar dangling over its prey a technological limitation at the time was the limited number of colors , which required that they create settings for cga , ega , and vga monitors a separate team ported a stripped down version of the game to the commodore 64 , spectrum and amstrad , which meant reducing the number of ships to 8 , not to mention the introduction of new bugs and balance issues the game was ultimately ported to the sega genesis , in a team led by fred ford because the genesis port was a cartridge-based game with no battery backup , it lacked the scenario-creator of its pc cousin , but it came pre-loaded with a few additional scenarios not originally in the game log of the 2007-06-13 irc session with toys for bob : '' the same goes for the genesis version of sc1 where we did a quick port with the intention of optimizing it for speed , but they though ( sic ) having a 12megabit cartridge was a much better selling point '' also , the port was not authorized by sega , which led led to a lawsuit between accolade and sega of america released under accolade 's new '' ballistic '' label for high quality games , the game was touted as the first 12-megabit cartridge created for the system when stardock became the top bidder atari 's star control assets , paul reiche indicated that he still owned the copyright in the original star control games , so stardock must have purchased the star control trademark as stardock began developing their new star control game , they re-iterated that they did not acquire the copyright to the first two games , and that they would need a license from reiche and ford to use their content and lore
