a personal go-kit generally takes some combination of units : a '' one-day '' ( or '' 24 hour '' ) kit , a '' three day '' ( or '' 72 hour '' ) kit that adds additional supplies , or a '' one week kit '' that adds yet additional personal items to the three-day kit in addition to allowing one to survive a disaster evacuation , a bug-out bag may also be used when sheltering in place as a response to emergencies such as blackouts , house fires , tornadoes , and other severe natural disasters the bag 's contents may vary according to the region of the user , as someone evacuating from the path of a hurricane may have different supplies from someone who lives in an area prone to blizzards , earthquakes , or wildfires the term go-kit is popular in the amateur radio service , especially in the amateur radio emergency service ( ares ) and radio amateur civil emergency service ( races ) communities , and describes a combination personal bug-out bag and portable amateur radio station the get me home kit can include , for example , enough water to get home , suitable walking shoes , a map ( not electronic ) , enough food for 12 hours , clothing for adverse weather , etc the recommendation that a bug-out bag contain enough supplies for 72 hours arises from advice from organizations responsible for disaster relief and management that it may take them up to 72 hours to reach people affected by a disaster and offer help the term has since been adopted by military training institutions around the world , with standard operating procedures involving a bug out location , a method of withdrawal , and the bare supplies needed to withdraw quickly but still survive in the field it is therefore prudent to gather into a single place all of the materials and supplies that might be required to do this , such as a bag or a few storage containers the term '' bug-out bag '' is related to , and possibly derived from , the '' bail-out bag '' emergency kit many military aviators carry swiss army knife a multi-tool duct tape and rope or paracord a mini shovel , axe/hatchet , or a combined version of the two for more portability folding saw super glue , which can also be used to suture wounds the primary purpose of a bug-out bag is to allow one to evacuate quickly if a disaster should strike the concept passed into wide usage among other military and law enforcement personnel , though the '' bail-out bag '' is as likely to include emergency gear for going into an emergency situation as for escaping an emergency
