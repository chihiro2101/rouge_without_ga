after the dardanelles campaign ended with the evacuation of allied forces from gallipoli in january 1916 , canopus was assigned to the british eastern mediterranean squadron , where she served until she returned to the united kingdom in april 1916 cradock had initially intended to take canopus with his squadron , which consisted of the armoured cruisers and , the light cruiser glasgow and the auxiliary cruiser , but her late arrival , coupled with the fact that she required an overhaul upon arriving in the falklands , forced cradock to proceed without her canopus departed the abrolhos rocks on 8 october 1914 to assist cradock 's ships in searching for the german east asia squadron of vice admiral maximilian von spee , which was en route the south atlantic from the far east to save weight , canopus carried less armour than the majestics— in the belt compared to —although the change from harvey armour in the majestics to krupp armour in canopus meant that the loss in protection was not as great as it might have been , krupp armour having greater protective value at a given weight than its harvey equivalent sturdee 's battlecruisers , much faster than spee 's ships , eventually caught and destroyed the east asia squadron , with the exception of the light cruiser , which was able to outrun the british pursuers after the world war i broke out in august 1914 , canopus was commissioned on 7 august 1914 , for service in the 8th battle squadron in the channel fleet , under the command of captain heathcoat grant canopus and her five sister ships were designed for service in east asia , where the new rising power japan was beginning to build a powerful navy , though this role was quickly made redundant by the anglo-japanese alliance of 1902 84 in early september , her sister ship relieved her and canopus transferred to the south america station to become guard ship there and provide support to the cruiser squadron of rear admiral christopher cradock 427 , 429 on 7 december , the main british squadron , commanded by vice admiral doveton sturdee , arrived in stanley and began coaling , with the intention of departing two days later to search for spee she remained at chatham until april 1916 , undergoing a refit there later in 1916 , having her eight main-deck 6-inch ( 152 & nbsp ; mm ) guns replaced by four on the battery deck and her 12-pounder and 3-pounder guns replaced by light antiaircraft weapons in 1917 , and becoming an accommodation ship in february 1918 357–359 canopus was still some south of cradock when he encountered spee 's squadron , and the german ships were faster than the british cruisers , preventing cradock from rejoining canopus 369 shortly after news of the battle reached britain , the royal navy ordered all naval forces in the region to consolidate ; this included the remnants of cradock 's command , along with the armoured cruisers , , and canopus herself was beached in the mudflats in a position that allowed her to cover the entrance to the harbour and have a field of fire landward to the southeast ; to reduce her visibility , her topmasts were struck and she was camouflaged the alliance meant that the united kingdom could have a reduced presence on the china station and battleships were no longer required there , so canopus was recalled from colombo in june 1905 and thus was the only canopus-class battleship which did not serve on the china station in the ensuing battle of coronel , the east asia squadron sank both of cradock 's armoured cruisers and damaged glasgow ; by the time cradock was defeated , canopus was still away captain philip francis tillard was appointed in command on 1 december 1902 , and she ended her mediterranean service in april the following year , and paid off into the reserve at portsmouth on 25 april 1903 during the 18 march attack , a fleet of british and french warships—including queen elizabeth and the battlecruiser inflexible—would attempt to suppress the forts in daylight , allowing the minesweepers to finally clear the fields unmolested by ottoman fire on 10 march 1907 , she transferred to the portsmouth division of the home fleet at portsmouth , where she was reduced to a nucleus crew in may 1907 gardiner & gray , p the ships of the 3rd fleet , though on the active list , were effectively in reserve , being manned only by caretaker crews and would be fully manned only in the event of war in december 1909 , she was reduced to service in the 4th division , home fleet , undergoing a refit at chatham dockyard from july 1911 to april 1912 during this service glasgow arrived in coronel on 31 october , but departed too early on 1 november to receive an order from the first sea lord that cradock should not risk engaging spee 's squadron without canopus 360–369 spee broke off the pursuit of the fleeing british ships when he became aware that canopus was in the area , writing the following day that , '' against this ship , we can hardly do anything 331–332 , 355 on 27 october , cradock detached his light cruiser to coronel to gather intelligence , and the next day ordered canopus to bring the colliers to the juan fernández islands , where his squadron would replenish its fuel canopus and swiftsure entered the straits at 13:20 and closed to within of the north shore , where at 14:20 they opened fire at the fortress on the other side of the straits , some away on 25 november , canopus intercepted a radio message that indicated that spee 's squadron had rounded cape horn , though the message was erroneous ; spee actually made the passage on the night of 1–2 december the ships fired for about two hours before the ottomans inside dardanus returned fire at 16:15 , which they did quite accurately , straddling canopus quickly and scoring a hit on her quarterdeck that damaged a wardroom returning to the commissioned reserve at portsmouth , she was rammed by the battleship in mount 's bay during manoeuvres on 5 august 1904 , suffering slight damage the three ships then withdrew , seemingly having achieved their objective , though that night , when destroyers and minesweepers tried to clear the minefields blocking the straits , they were met with very heavy fire and were forced to withdraw
