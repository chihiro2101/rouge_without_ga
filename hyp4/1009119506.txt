another early mention dates from march 13 , 1435 , when the storage inventory of count john iv of katzenelnbogen in rüsselsheim ( a small principality on the rhine , close to today 's rheingau ) lists '' 22 ß umb seczreben rießlingen in die wingarten '' ( '' 22 shillings for riesling vine cuttings for the vineyard '' ) a map of kintzheim in alsace from 1348 contains the text zu dem russelinge , but it is not certain that this reference is to the grape variety more recently , dna fingerprinting by ferdinand regner indicated that one parent of riesling is gouais blanc , known to the germans as weißer heunisch , a variety that , while rare today , was widely grown by the french and german peasantry of the middle ages it is presumed that the riesling was born somewhere in the valley of the rhine , since both heunisch and traminer have a long documented history in germany , but with parents from either side of the adriatic the cross could have happened anywhere on the way it has also been suggested , but not proved , that the red riesling of riesling is the forerunner of the common , '' white '' riesling riesling wines are often consumed when young , when they make a fruity and aromatic wine which may have aromas of green or other apples , grapefruit , peach , gooseberry , honey , rose blossom or cut green grass , and usually a crisp taste due to the high acidity michael broadbent , vintage wines little , brown 2002 pg 343 sweet riesling wines , such as german trockenbeerenauslese are especially suited for cellaring since the high sugar content provides for additional preservation while an integral part of the aroma profile of mature riesling and sought after by many experienced drinkers , it may be off-putting to those unaccustomed to it , and those who primarily seek young and fruity aromas in their wine the negative attitude to petrol aromas in young riesling , and the preference for fruitier young wines of this variety , seem more common in germany than in alsace or on the export market , and some german producers , especially the volume-oriented ones , have even gone so far as to consider the petrol notes a defect which they try to avoid , even at the cost of producing wines that are less suited to extended cellar aging in that vein , the german wine institute has gone so far as to omit the mentioning of '' petrol '' as a possible aroma on their german-language wine aroma wheel , which is supposed to be specially adapted to german wines , and despite the fact that professor ann c from what is known of the production of carotenoids in grapes , factors that are likely to increase the tdn potential are : ripe grapes , i.e , low yields and late harvest high sun exposure water stress , which is most likely in regions which do not practice irrigation , and there primarily in certain dry vineyard sites in hot and dry years high acid content these factors are usually also considered to contribute to high quality riesling wines , so the petrol note is in fact more likely to develop in top wines than in simpler wines made from high-yielding vineyards , especially those from the new world , where irrigation is common through evaporation caused by the fungus botrytis cinerea ( '' noble rot '' ) or by freezing , as in the case of ice wine ( in german , eiswein ) , water is removed and the resulting wine is felt to offer richer layers on the palate these concentrated wines have more sugar ( in extreme cases hundreds of grams per litre ) , more acid ( to give balance to the sugar ) , more flavour , and more complexity permission from the abbey of fulda ( which owned the vineyard ) to start picking riesling grapes arrived too late and the grapes had begun to rot ; yet it turned out that the wine made from them was still of excellent quality today riesling is germany ’ s leading grape variety , known for its characteristic “ transparency ” in flavour and presentation of terroir , andrew ellson , roll out the riesling , german wines are making a comeback , in : the times dated 9 december 2019 to this last item there is an exception with some vinters in the wine regions of palatinate ( pfalz ) and baden using new oak aging in germany , sugar levels at time of harvest are an important consideration in the wine 's production with prädikat levels measuring the sweetness of the wine today over a fifth of alsace 's vineyards are covered with riesling vines , mostly in the haut-rhin district , with the varietal being very different from neighboring german riesling in contrast to german wine laws , alsatian rieslings can be chaptalized , a process in which the alcoholic content is increased through the addition of sugar to the must riesling still flourishes in the great southern ( in particular mt barker , frankland river and porongorup ) , clare valley , in particular the areas of watervale and around the polish hill river , and the cooler eden valley and high eden regions riesling was first planted in new zealand in the 1970s and has flourished in the relatively cool climate of the marlborough area and for late harvests in the nelson region new york is also a notable producer of riesling-based ice wine , although a large majority of new york ice wine is made from vidal blanc and vignoles the riesling that does come out of california tends to be softer , fuller , and having more diverse flavours than a '' typical '' german riesling in michigan , whose old mission peninsula and leelanau peninsula avas ( near traverse city ) are known for their ice wine , riesling is a fairly common variety , in part on account of its suitability for that purpose department of agriculture , national agricultural statistics service , michigan field office , january 25 , 2006 , , accessed july 20 , 2006 riesling is grown in other regions as well , including colder parts of relatively warm states such as oklahoma ( where it has even been made into an eiswein and texas late harvest wines and some sparkling wines are produced with riesling in niagara but it is table wines from dry to off-dry that hold the largest share of production urbanshoff in the mosel , herman weiss , was an early pioneer in niagara 's modern viticulture , selling his strain of mosel clone riesling to many producers in west niagara ( these vines are well over 20 years old now ) in british columbia , riesling is commonly grown for use in icewine , table wine , and sekt style sparkling wines , a notable example of which is cipes brut in nova scotia , particularly in the annapolis valley region , riesling is showing significant promise , being shaped by the warm summer days with cool nights and the extension of the growing season that is being observed riesling is also widely grown in hungary , italy , particularly friuli-venezia giulia , croatia , south africa , chile and central europe , particularly romania and moldova , serbia , kazakhstan and uzbekistan in viticulture , the two main components in growing riesling grapes are to keep it '' long & low '' meaning that the ideal situation for riesling is a climate that allows for a long , slow ripening and proper pruning to keep the yield low and the flavor concentrated it can be paired with white fish or pork , and is one of the few wines that can stand up to the stronger flavours and spices of thai and chinese cuisine a riesling 's typical aromas are of flowers , tropical fruits , and mineral stone ( such as slate or quartz ) , although , with time , the wine acquires a petrol note as mentioned above riesling is almost never fermented or aged in new oak ( although large old oak barrels are often used to store and stabilize riesling-based wines in germany and alsace ) to confuse matters , '' red riesling '' has also been used as a synonym for red-skinned traminer grapes ( such as the savagnin rose of klevener de heiligenstein ) and the obscure variety hanns , which is a seed plant of roter veltliner in the late 19th century german horticulturalists devoted many efforts to develop new riesling hybrids that would create a more flexible , less temperamental grape that could still retain some of the elegant characteristics of riesling the most notable is the müller-thurgau developed in the geisenheim grape breeding institute in 1882 , which is a cross of riesling and madeleine royale ( although long believed to be riesling x silvaner ) the vivc lists the following crosses with riesling as the first parent : alb de yaloven , arnsburger , augustriesling , beutelriesling , bouquetriesling , dalkauer , edelmuskat , ehrenfelser , feinriesling , floricica , frühriesling , geisenheim 195 , geisenheim 643-10 , geisenheim 643-20 , geisenheim 649 , johanniter , kocsis zsuzsa , manzoni bianco ,
