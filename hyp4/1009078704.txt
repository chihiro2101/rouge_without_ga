alternatives for late blight control in potatoes , from attra google map of tomato potato blight daily risk across ne usa species profile – late blight ( phytophthora infestans ) , national invasive species information center , united states national agricultural library support for mexico comes from multiple observations including the fact that populations are genetically most diverse in mexico , late blight is observed in native tuber-bearing solanum species , populations of the pathogen are in hardy–weinberg equilibrium , the two mating types occur in a 1:1 ratio , and detailed phylogeographic and evolutionary studies the persistence of viable pathogen within tubers , such as those that are left in the ground after the previous year 's harvest or left in cull piles is a major problem in disease management infestans isolates , since effective plant disease resistance only results when the pathogen expresses a rxlr effector gene that matches the corresponding plant resistance ( r ) gene ; effector-r gene interactions trigger a range of plant defenses , such as the production of compounds toxic to the pathogen whether a weapon based on the pathogen would be effective is questionable , due to the difficulties in delivering viable pathogen to an enemy 's fields , and the role of uncontrollable environmental factors in spreading the disease a beaumont period is a period of 48 consecutive hours , in at least 46 of which the hourly readings of temperature and relative humidity at a given place have not been less than and 75 % , respectively some rxlr proteins are avirulence proteins , meaning that they can be detected by the plant and lead to a hypersensitive response which restricts the growth of the pathogen the species name infestans is the present participle of the latin verb , meaning : '' attacking , destroying '' , from which we get the word '' to infest '' a resistance gene effective against most known strains of blight has been identified from a wild relative of the potato , solanum bulbocastanum , and introduced by genetic engineering into cultivated varieties of potato by using weather forecasting systems , such as blitecast , if the following conditions occur as the canopy of the crop closes , then the use of fungicides is recommended to prevent an epidemic as colder than average for the season and with greater than average rainfall , there was a major infestation of tomato plants , specifically in the eastern states a major late blight outbreak on potato in germany therefore went untreated , and the resulting scarcity of potatoes led to the deaths of 700,000 german civilians from starvation until the 1970s , the a2 mating type was restricted to mexico , but now in many regions of the world both a1 and a2 isolates can be found in the same region '' chemical and biological weapons : possession and programs past and present '' , james martin center for nonproliferation studies , middlebury college , april 9 , 2002 , accessed november 14 , 2008 given the dangers of copper toxicity , other organic control options that have been shown to be effective include horticultural oils , phosphorous acids , and rhamnolipid biosurfactants , while sprays containing '' beneficial '' microbes such as bacillus subtilis or compounds that encourage the plant to produce defensive chemicals ( such as knotweed extract ) have not performed as well variation in such traits also occurs in north america , however importation of new genotypes from mexico appears to be the predominant cause of genetic diversity , as opposed to sexual recombination within potato or tomato fields this management technique can be thought of as a field-scale hypersensitive response similar to what occurs in some plant-viral interactions whereby cells surrounding the initial point of infection are killed in order to prevent proliferation of the pathogen all of the aforementioned fungicides need to be tank mixed with a broad-spectrum fungicide such as mancozeb or chlorothalonil not just for resistance management but also because the potato plants will be attacked by other pathogens at the same time the genus name phytophthora comes from the greek – , meaning : '' plant '' – plus the greek , meaning : '' decay , ruin , perish '' infected tubers develop grey or dark patches that are reddish brown beneath the skin , and quickly decay to a foul-smelling mush caused by the infestation of secondary bacterial soft rot infestans vary in their aggressiveness on potato or tomato , in sporulation rate , and sensitivity to fungicides the effect of phytophthora infestans in ireland in 1845–52 was one of the factors which caused over one million to starve to death and forced another two million to emigrate from affected countries fungicides for the control of potato blight are normally only used in a preventative manner , optionally in conjunction with disease forecasting the first recorded instances of the disease were in the united states , in philadelphia and new york city in early 1843 to increase the probability of successfully storing potatoes from a field where late blight was known to occur during the growing season , some products can be applied just prior to entering storage ( e.g in particular , volunteer plants sprouting from infected tubers are thought to be a major source of inoculum at the start of a growing season the co-occurrence of the two mating types is significant due to the possibility of sexual recombination and formation of oospores , which can survive the winter once in storage , there is n't much that can be done besides emptying the parts of the bin that contain tubers infected with phytophthora infestans if adequate field scouting occurs and late blight is found soon after disease development , localized patches of potato plants can be killed with a desiccant ( e.g under most conditions , the hyphae and asexual sporangia can survive for only brief periods in plant debris or soil , and are generally killed off during frosts or very warm weather a smith period is at least two consecutive days where min temperature is or above and on each day at least 11 hours when the relative humidity is greater than 90 %
