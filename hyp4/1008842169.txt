when the eager mercantilism minister asked how the french state could be of service to the merchants and help promote their commerce , le gendre replied simply : '' laissez-nous faire '' ( '' leave it to us '' or '' let us do it '' , the french verb not requiring an object ) the anecdote on the colbert–le gendre meeting appeared in a 1751 article in the journal économique , written by french minister and champion of free trade rené de voyer , marquis d'argenson—also the first known appearance of the term in print oncken , die maxime laissez faire et laissez passer , ihr ursprung , ihr werden , 1866 argenson himself had used the phrase earlier ( 1736 ) in his own diaries in a famous outburst : vincent de gournay , a french physiocrat and intendant of commerce in the 1750s , popularized the term laissez-faire as he allegedly adopted it from françois quesnay 's writings on china he forged it into a larger maxim all his own : '' laissez faire et laissez passer '' ( '' let do and let pass '' ) his motto has also been identified as the longer '' laissez faire et laissez passer , le monde va de lui même ! '' ( '' let do and let pass , the world goes on by itself ! '' ) ) also credit the marquis d'argenson with the phrase '' pour gouverner mieux , il faudrait gouverner moins '' ( '' to govern best , one needs to govern less '' ) , possibly the source of the famous '' that government is best which governs least '' motto popular in american circles , attributed variously to thomas paine , thomas jefferson and henry thoreau 54–67 the book laissez faire and the general-welfare state states : '' the physiocrats , reacting against the excessive mercantilist regulations of the france of their day , expressed a belief in a 'natural order ' or liberty under which individuals in following their selfish interests contributed to the general good since , in their view , this natural order functioned successfully without the aid of government , they advised the state to restrict itself to upholding the rights of private property and individual liberty , to removing all artificial barriers to trade , and to abolishing all useless laws '' herbert spencer was opposed to a slightly different application of laissez faire—to '' that miserable laissez-faire '' that leads to men 's ruin , saying : '' along with that miserable laissez-faire which calmly looks on while men ruin themselves in trying to enforce by law their equitable claims , there goes activity in supplying them , at other men 's cost , with gratis novel-reading ! '' justice part iv of ethics ( 1892 ) in spencer 's case , the right of private ownership was being assailed and it was that miserable spirit of laissez-faire in halls of legislation that exhausted men in the effort of protecting their right as a product of the enlightenment , laissez-faire was '' conceived as the way to unleash human potential through the restoration of a natural system , a system unhindered by the restrictions of government '' in a similar vein , adam smith viewed the economy as a natural system and the market as an organic part of that system for smith , laissez-faire was '' a program for the abolition of laws constraining the market , a program for the restoration of order and for the activation of potential growth '' jeremy bentham used the term , but it was probably james mill 's reference to the laissez-faire maxim ( together with the '' pas trop gouverner '' motto ) in an 1824 entry for the encyclopædia britannica that really brought the term into wider english usage smith , adam smith and the origins of american enterprise : how the founding fathers turned to a great economist 's writings and created the american economy , macmillan , 2004 , , pp american individualist anarchists such as benjamin tucker saw themselves as economic laissez-faire socialists and political individualists while arguing that their '' anarchistic socialism '' or '' individual anarchism '' was '' consistent manchesterism '' for more than a decade , the experiment appeared successful , but 1768 saw a poor harvest , and the cost of bread rose so high that there was widespread starvation while merchants exported grain in order to obtain the best profit just as liberals supported freedom of thought in the intellectual sphere , so were they equally prepared to champion the principles of free trade and free competition in the sphere of economics , seeing the state as merely a passive policeman , protecting private property and administering justice , but not interfering with the affairs of its citizens in 1847 , referring to the famine then underway in ireland , founder of the economist james wilson wrote : '' it is no man 's business to provide for another '' the creation of a strong central government able to promote science , invention , industry and commerce was seen as an essential means of taxing and spending clause and making the economy of the united states strong enough for them to determine their own destiny others , including jefferson , view bourgin 's study , written in the 1940s and not published until 1989 , as an over-interpretation of the evidence , intended originally to defend the new deal and later to counter ronald reagan 's economic policies donohue argues that in the 19th century liberalism in the united states had distinctive characteristics and that '' at the center of classical liberal theory in europe was the idea of laissez-faire notable examples of government intervention in the period prior to the american civil war include the establishment of the patent office in 1802 ; the establishment of the office of standard weights and measures in 1830 ; the creation of the coast and geodetic survey in 1807 and other measures to improve river and harbor navigation ; the various army expeditions to the west , beginning with lewis and clark 's corps of discovery in 1804 and continuing into the 1870s , almost always under the direction of an officer from the army corps of topographical engineers and which provided crucial information for the overland pioneers that followed ; the assignment of army engineer officers to assist or direct the surveying and construction of the early railroads and canals ; and the establishment of the first bank of the united states and second bank of the united states as well as various protectionist measures ( e.g for instance , the first national bank would not have reached the desk of president george washington in the absence of an agreement that was reached between alexander hamilton and several southern members of congress to locate the capitol in the district of columbia in the early 19th century , '' it is quite clear that the laissez-faire label is an inappropriate one '' to apply to the relationship between the united states government and industry in the mid-19th century , the united states followed the whig tradition of economic nationalism , which included increased state control , regulation and macroeconomic development of infrastructure in order to help pay for its war effort in the civil war , the united states government imposed its first personal income tax on 5 august 1861 as part of the revenue act of 1861 ( 3 % of all incomes over us 800 ; rescinded in 1872 ) following world war i and the great depression , the united states turned to a mixed economy which combined free enterprise with a progressive tax and in which from time to time the government stepped in to support and protect american industry from competition from overseas hence , the source of much of the current deterioration of trade is not the general state of the economy , but rather the government 's mix of fiscal and monetary policies – that is , the problematic juxtaposition of bold tax reductions , relatively tight monetary targets , generous military outlays , and only modest cuts in major entitlement programs a more recent advocate of total laissez-faire has been objectivist ayn rand , who described it as '' the abolition of any and all forms of government intervention in production and trade , the separation of state and economics , in the same way and for the same reasons as the separation of church and state '' this viewpoint is summed up in what is known as the iron law of regulation , which states that all government economic regulation eventually leads to a net loss in social welfare a closely related conception is that of raw or pure capitalism , or unrestrained capitalism , that refers to capitalism free of social regulations , with low , minimal or no government and operating almost entirely on the profit motive it typically has a bad connotation , which hints towards a perceived need for restraint due to social needs and securities that can not be adequately responded to by companies with just a motive for making profit the main issues of raw capitalism are said to lie in its disregard for quality , durability , sustainability , respect for the environment and human beings as well as a lack of morality although laissez-faire has been commonly associated with capitalism , there is a similar laissez-faire economic theory and system associated with socialism called left-wing laissez-faire , nick manley '' in fact , it 's a fairly common observation among market anarchists that genuinely free markets have the most legitimate claim to the label “ socialism who stress the value of radically free markets , termed freed markets to distinguish them from the common conception which these left-libertarians believe to be riddled with capitalist and statist privileges or market-oriented left-libertarians , proponents of this approach strongly affirm the classical liberal ideas of self-ownership and free markets while maintaining that taken to their logical conclusions these ideas support anti-capitalist , anti-corporatist , anti-hierarchical and pro-labor positions in economics ; anti-imperialism in foreign policy ; and thoroughly radical views regarding such cultural issues as gender , sexuality and race johnson and others ( echoing the language of benjamin tucker , lysander spooner and thomas hodgskin ) in maintaining that—because of its heritage , emancipatory goals and potential—radical market anarchism should be seen by its proponents and by others as part of the socialist tradition and that market anarchists can and should call themselves socialists see gary chartier , '' advocates of freed markets should oppose capitalism , '' '' free-market anti-capitalism ?
