there are three distinct types of muscles : skeletal muscles , cardiac muscle , and smooth muscle muscles provide strength , balance , posture , movement and heat for the body to keep warm skeletal muscles , like other striated muscles , are composed of myocytes , or muscle fibers , which are in turn composed of myofibrils , which are composed of sarcomeres , the basic building block of striated muscle tissue when atp is used , it becomes adenosine diphosphate ( adp ) , and since muscles store little atp , they must continuously replace the discharged adp with atp smooth muscles are controlled directly by the autonomic nervous system and are involuntary , meaning that they are incapable of being moved by conscious thought functions such as heartbeat and lungs ( which are capable of being willingly controlled , be it to a limited extent ) are involuntary muscles but are not smooth muscles acetylcholine , ( a neurotransmitter used in skeletal muscle contraction ) is released from the axon terminal of the nerve cell when an action potential reaches the microscopic junction called a synapse a group of chemical messengers cross the synapse and stimulate the formation of electrical changes , which are produced in the muscle cell when the acetylcholine binds to receptors on its surface at lower activity levels , when exercise continues for a long duration ( several minutes or longer ) , energy is produced aerobically by combining oxygen with carbohydrates and fats stored in the body during activity that is higher in intensity , with possible duration decreasing as intensity increases , atp production can switch to anaerobic pathways , such as the use of the phosphocreatine and the phosphagen system or anaerobic glycolysis aerobic atp production is biochemically much slower and can only be used for long-duration , low-intensity exercise , but produces no fatiguing waste products that can not be removed immediately from the sarcomere and the body , and it results in a much greater number of atp molecules per fat or carbohydrate molecule
