those divisions can create constructs within the ideologies of gender and affect the relationships between genders , as well as advocate or challenge social and racial class structures eichberg sees three different types of bodies as highlighting the difference between disciplined and undisciplined bodies in sport : the dialogic body , of different shapes and sizes , which are given to freeing oneself from control , and were he main type in pre-modern festivals and carnivals while women researchers in this field do have to deal with gender-related issues when it comes to their research , it does not prevent them from being able to gather and understand the data they are collecting however , the history of sport shows that colonized are n't necessarily manipulated through sport , while sport professionalization , and their own popular culture , helped the working class avoid mass subordination to bourgeois values sports have always been of tremendous impact to the world as a whole , as well as individual societies and the people within them for example , '' stage fright , '' or nervousness and apprehension , can impact their performance in their sport , be it in a positive or negative way some women researchers also feel as though they have to '' earn '' their place within the sports research field whereas men , for the most part , do not physical exertion inevitably leads to development of muscle , which is connected to masculinity , which is in contrast to the idea of women as presented by modern consumer culture sport allows for creation of various social identities within the framework of a single game or match , which may change during it or throughout the course of multiple matches there are the professional athletes , the coaching staff , the referees , the television crew , the commentators , and last but not least , the fans and spectators international sociology of sport association north american society for the sociology of sport sociology of sport

causes of physical injury , while at the same time keeping the techniques and strategies particular to those sports becoming a fan teaches you a large variety of skills as well that are a very important part of everyday life in the office , at home , and on the go this does not apply to all sports , as some value the ability to cover a number of roles as necessary in modern society , relationship are organized to be as efficient as possible , based on technical knowledge , instead of moral and political principles hegemony research describes the relations of power , as well as methods and techniques used by dominant groups to achieve ideological consent , without resorting to physical coercion sports sociologists believe that women can have a unique perspective when gathering research on sports since they are able to more closely look at and understand the female fan side of sporting events as activities in the center of various people/groups interests (

sacred and may not be polluted by pitch invaders , and lead to intense emotional states in fans emotion is very important in sports ; athletes can use them to convey specific and significant
