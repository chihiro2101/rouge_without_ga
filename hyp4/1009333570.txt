1894 ) was arrested for swindling and thefts in the autumn of 1915 , shortly after his mobilisation , and tried by court martial however , bonin never formally charged them and in july 1920 they were released from custody – in marie-catherine 's case on medical grounds ( she had a bad back ) and in maurice 's case because according to bonin , his continuing detention was not helpful to the investigation in gambais , where landru rented his second house from december 1915 till his arrest , there was one constable in his early seventies , stationed in the village , and a single mounted gendarme in the market town of houdan , four miles ( 6.4 & nbsp ; km ) away in fact , one of his known victims had been '' engaged '' to the married landru for more than two years before he murdered her , a period during which he killed at least five other women ; another victim had known him for more than a year-and-a-half before she disappeared ; while his last known victim , a prostitute , may have first encountered landru as early as 1914 it was also taken for granted by the police and the prosecution that he had recorded the total number of his victims in a list of 11 names and code-names he had written at the back of a little black notebook ( known in french as a carnet ) which was discovered immediately after his arrest at the start of december , jeanne , landru ( posing as '' monsieur cuchet '' ) and andré moved to a house in vernouillet , a small town by the seine , 35 & nbsp ; km northwest of paris she rapidly compiled a dossier for the police , noting landru 's physical appearance , his known movements with célestine since 1915 , the location and design of his house near gambais , his thefts from célestine 's bank accounts , the forged postcards after her disappearance and his phony invitations to dinner andrée spent the next ten days living with landru ( whom she called 'lulu ' ) in a room he rented near paris 's gare du nord , and then a further fortnight at his rented house near gambais , where she was seen by a local game warden learning to ride a bicycle celebrities who came to watch landru included the reigning queen of french musical theatre , mistinguett , the actors maurice chevalier and sacha guitry , the writer rudyard kipling ( in paris to receive an honorary degree ) and the novelist colette ( who covered the first session for the newspaper le matin ) he itemised eight '' proofs '' which in his view demonstrated landru 's guilt beyond all doubt , from the one-way train tickets landru had bought the women on their last known journey to gambais to the killer 's tell-tale noting of the hour they disappeared – '' the hour of the execution '' landru had escaped to a village near the town of chantilly , 50 & nbsp ; km north of paris , in the company of jeanne cuchet , a pretty , 39-year-old parisian seamstress who had been widowed in 1909 ” marie lacoste letter to the mayor of gambais , 12 january 1919 , paris police archives , dossier buisson the mayor denied any knowledge of célestine or a man called frémyet living at the maison ( or villa ) tric landru 's subsequent murders between 1915 and 1919 were presented chronologically at his trial , creating the false impression that he had met the women in the order in which he killed them marie disclaimed any knowledge of his activities during the war , even though in august 1917 she had bid unsuccessfully at a property auction in gambais on landru 's behalf for a house in which he was interested however , moro was also a passionate opponent of the death penalty and did not believe that the prosecution could remotely prove that landru had certainly killed the 10 women and one young man on the murder charge sheet landru 's notorious oven , in which he allegedly burnt the remains of his victims , was sold at auction in 1923 to a businessman who wanted to put it on display in the italian city of turin , beyond french jurisdiction in order of the presumed date of their murder , they were : thérèse laborde-line , 46 ( vernouillet , june 1915 ) born in argentina , thérèse was a divorced , unemployed widow who was estranged from her only son , a postal clerk , and her daughter-in-law the location was a compromise between the authorities in the department of seine-et-oise ( now yvelines ) , where landru had allegedly committed the murders , and the judiciary in paris , where his victims had lived the defence would not contest the multiple charges of theft and fraud ( even though landru denied them ) , which would be enough to send landru for the rest of his life into exile with hard labour in french guyana – an ordeal which would probably kill him before long , given landru 's poor physical health meanwhile , landru 's wife lived for most of the war in the northwestern paris suburb of clichy under the false name '' frémyet '' ( one of landru 's aliases ) in an apartment where he was seen coming and going at regular intervals '' examen de landru au point de vue mental '' , 25 june 1920 , paris police archives , dossier général they produced no substantive clinical evidence to support their new diagnosis , which was possibly the result of pressure from bonin to bring landru to trial rather than send him to an asylum in reality , landru 's capture was entirely due to a chance sighting of him on 11 april 1919 by marie 's friend laure bonhoure as he was shopping with his mistress fernande segret in a crockery shop on rue de rivoli they did not know if the skeletons were female , because there were no pelvic bones ; nor could the forensic scientists confirm that the fragments came from three or more of the women who were known to have vanished at gambais to varying degrees , landru 's wife and four children were all complicit in shielding him from the police during the war and in abetting his thefts from the missing women he did not begin to keep detailed notes in the carnet until the summer of 1916 , and even then , statements by various witnesses proved beyond doubt that landru did not record all his planned and impromptu encounters with women in the later years of the war the investigating magistrate gabriel bonin was initially confident that he could wrap up the case in a matter of days , following the discovery on 29 april 1919 of some tiny fragments of charred human bone debris beneath a pile of leaves in landru 's back garden at gambais what the police lacked was direct evidence of murder , apart from the charred bone debris discovered at gambais ; and under the microscope , these fragments turned out to be '' a veritable puzzle '' , according to dr charles paul , the director of the paris police laboratory lastly , landru benefited from the indifference of police officers and village officials to the fate of the women , at a time when hundreds of thousands of young men were losing their lives at the front every day , the newspapers gave saturation coverage of the proceedings and as the trial progressed , and the possibility of landru 's acquittal on the murder charges seemed to increase , the proceedings attracted trainloads of spectators from paris in december 1919 the investigating magistrate bonin ordered the arrest of landru 's wife and maurice landru on suspicion of complicity in landru 's thefts and frauds she also said that in the autumn of 1912 , as soon as he was released from prison , landru stole around 12,000 francs ( approximately 40,000 in modern money ) that his father had pointedly left her and the four children , rather than him claude chabrol 's french language landru ( 1963 ) , from a script by the novelist françoise sagan , ignored the first four murders at vernouillet and recast the remaining women as fashionable and attractive marie lacoste , the younger half-sister of célestine , was an unmarried housemaid who disliked landru , alias george frémyet , from the moment she first met him at célestine 's apartment in the summer of 1915 landru was examined by dr charles vallon , one of france 's leading criminal psychiatrists , who concluded that landru was '' on the frontiers of madness '' but was not yet insane and responsible for his actions under examination , landru repeatedly made clear that he knew more about the fate of the women than he was prepared to reveal , ostensibly because he had had a '' sacred compact '' with them which swore him to silence jeanne cuchet letter to mme morin , 4 january 1915 , yvelines archives , carton 2u 769/2760 in mid-january , andré learned to his joy that his scheduled recruitment to the army had been brought forward two years to the summer of 1915 annette was divorced and childless , following the death of her only son in infancy , and was looking for a so-called '' vieux monsieur '' ( sugar daddy ) in september 1916 when she spotted landru 's lonely hearts advertisement in the paris evening daily , la presse marie visited célestine 's old apartment , where the concierge told her that célestine had last been seen there in the summer of 1917 and that at least one other woman had subsequently spent the night at the address with '' frémyet '' before he paid off the lease he was in and out of prison for the next decade , during this period , landru 's wife and four children lived in a series of cheap rented apartments in and around paris in bonin 's narrative , landru was a serial killer who had acted alone , murdering his victims after he had stolen their assets , to prevent them from reporting him to the police moro ridiculed the incompetence of the police , who had failed to seal landru 's property at gambais after their first search of the house and gardens , when they had not discovered the bone debris the chief prosecuting attorney robert godefroy , a plodding government barrister , struggled from the start of the trial to make any headway with landru , or prevent moro undermining the credibility of the police and forensic witnesses landru 's wife forged the signature of his eighth known victim , célestine buisson , so he could gain access to célestine 's bank account , and impersonated his ninth known victim , louise jaume , for the same purpose '' landru and marie-catherine 's first child marie was born illegitimately in 1891 , shortly after landru began three years ' obligatory military service in the northern french town of saint-quentin , rising from private to the position of deputy quartermaster landru had kept the booty he had not sold at a garage in clichy and various storage depots around paris , along with files on dozens of women he had contacted during the war via lonely hearts advertisements and matrimonial agencies landru 's youngest son charles , born in 1900 , worked as his self-styled '' apprentice '' , helping landru remove furniture and other possessions from at least five of his known victims ' apartments and latterly acting as his father 's chauffeur on 12 april , at around midday , belin returned with two fellow officers and a newly-drafted warrant and arrested landru , who had just returned from accosting a woman on the metro in the weeks after landru 's arrest , the police gathered overwhelming proof that landru had stolen the financial assets and possessions of the 10 missing women on the list in his carnet indeed , it is arguable that landru might never have been arrested without the persistence of another woman who forced the authorities to investigate the suspicious man who rented the villa tric outside gambais to support his argument , moro claimed that all the women had been in some sense estranged from their families , an allegation that was demonstrably untrue in several cases , and arguable in several others this possibility was reinforced by the evidence of one witness in particular , an army doctor who had seen landru dumping a heavy package in a pond near gambais in the late spring or early summer of 1916

documents in a later newspaper interview , marie-catherine described landru as '' a model husband '' and father in the early years of their marriage , even though she also told police that he was '' a skirt chaser '' from the very beginning
