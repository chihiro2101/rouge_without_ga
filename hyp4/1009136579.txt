gbv began touring again in september 2012 with a 13 show '' tour of the south '' , starting in dayton , ohio , on september 8 , 2012 , which included gigs in cleveland and pittsburgh , and stops in north carolina , florida , georgia , new orleans , texas ( houston and austin ) , missouri and kansas , with the final show on september 29 , 2012 , in st the band surprised early audiences accustomed to the generally shambling , lo-fi and collage-like quality of the records with their energetic live show , featuring pollard 's homegrown rock theatrics ( consisting of karate-kicks , leaps , roger daltrey-inspired mic-twirling , later beer can throwing at rival bands ) , mitch mitchell 's windmilling and chain smoking , sometime bassist greg demos ' striped pants , a never-ending barrage of tunes that all seemed to clock in under 90 seconds , and prodigious alcohol consumption all around at this time , the always-fluid guided by voices lineup coalesced around the core of pollard , guitarists tobin sprout and mitch mitchell ( not to be confused with jimi hendrix 's drummer ) , bassist greg demos , and drummer kevin fennell at the july 16 , 2016 show , guitarist nick mitchell was fired from the band , in part for his inability to get along with at least one other member of the band , as well as his unusual demand that pollard pay for mitchell 's wife to accompany the band on tour , which was refused current robert pollard – lead vocals ( 1983–2004 , 2010–2014 , 2016–present ) , guitar ( 1983–1992 ) doug gillard – guitar , backing vocals ( 1997–2004 , 2016–present ) kevin

voices ' live act became legendary , with shows often stretching past the three-hour mark , and populated by an endless stream of new and classic songs , pollard solo tracks , impromptu covers of the who , david bowie and the rolling stones , all accompanied by continuous alcohol consumption '' pollard also commented on the fact that gbv and his solo output are basically the same , when he told harp magazine , in 2005 , '' you know , a lot of people try to distinguish things between what is robert pollard and what is guided by voices in february 2016 , the official guided by voices facebook page announced that gbv has been announced to headline the sled island festival on june 25 and that a '' strikingly fresh guided by voices album in the works , '' on which pollard plays all the instruments with the release of the ultra-limited album propeller in 1992 ( of which only 500 copies were pressed , each with a unique , handmade cover ) , guided by voices for the first time gained some recognition outside of their hometown however , the strain of heavy touring would ultimately lead to the demise of the '' classic lineup '' , with sprout deciding to retire from the road in order to focus on raising his first child , his painting , and his solo musical career however , after another year of rigorous touring , the '' guided by verde '' lineup split in late 1997 following pollard 's announcement in an interview that he intended to work with other musicians on the next guided by voices project cobra verde 's doug gillard was tapped for yet another new guided by voices lineup in 1998 , which also included '' classic '' -era bassist greg demos , former breeders drummer jim macpherson , and eventually , former amps/breeders guitarist the amps in june 2010 , matador

almost bringing gbv back for his album robert pollard is off to business but decided against it , instead forming a new label titled guided by voices inc the following album mag earwhig ! , combined a new hard-rocking swagger with classic lo-fi fragments and one track , '' jane of the waking universe '' , that featured the classic lineup for one last time after departing from tvt in 2002 , guided by voices returned to matador and released universal truths and cycles , a departure from the previous two radio-aspiring albums , and a return to the band 's mid-90s , mid-fi aesthetic guided by voices is frequently referenced by novelist and poet , dennis cooper , in his george miles cycle and the group 's lyrics appear in guide , the fourth of the five novels which make up the cycle sprout , who was briefly featured in an early-'80s version of the band , had re-joined circa propeller and soon became pollard 's primary musical foil , in addition to contributing several of his own songs to the band 's catalog the band canceled what was to have been their first post-reunion show in the uk at the all tomorrow 's parties ' i 'll be your mirror ' festival at alexandra palace , london ,
