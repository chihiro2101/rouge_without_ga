the breed is known to be independent and self-assured , playful , intelligent , and has been nicknamed the 'diehard ' because of its rugged nature and endless determination they are sometimes described as an aloof breed , although it has been noted that they tend to be very loyal to their family and are known to attach themselves to one or two people it has been suggested that the scottish terrier can make a good watchdog due to its tendency to bark only when necessary and because it is typically reserved with strangers , although this is not always the case according to research by the veterinary medical data program ( 1986 ) , six cancers that scotties appeared to be more at risk for ( when compared to other breeds ) are : ( in descending order ) bladder cancer and other transitional cell carcinomas of the lower urinary tract ; malignant melanoma ; gastric carcinoma ; squamous cell carcinoma of the skin ; lymphosarcoma and nasal carcinoma research has suggested that scottish terriers are 20 times more likely to get bladder cancer than other breeds and the most common kind of bladder cancer is transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder ( tcc ) '' symptoms of tcc are blood in the urine , straining to urinate , and frequent urination—although owners noticing any of these symptoms should also be aware that the same symptoms may also be indicative of a urinary tract infection also known as '' lion jaw '' , '' westy jaw '' or '' scotty jaw '' , this condition of craniomandibular osteopathy is caused by excessive bone growth in the bottom jaw , usually occurring between four and seven months of age this condition has also been seen in other breeds of dog , such as the west highland white terrier , cairn terrier , boston terrier , as well as some larger breeds such as bullmastiffs the condition appears in most breeds to some extent , but other breeds with an increased risk include the golden retriever , german shepherd dog , basset hound and manchester terrier thumb initial grouping of several of the highland terriers ( including the scottie ) under the generic name skye terriers caused some confusion in the breed 's lineage it is certain , however , that scotties and west highland white terriers are closely related—both their forefathers originated from the blackmount region of perthshire and the moor of rannoch many dog writers after the early 19th century seem to agree that there were two varieties of terrier existing in britain at the time—a rough-haired so-called scotch terrier and a smooth-haired english terrier thomas brown , in his biological sketches and authentic anecdotes of dogs ( 1829 ) , states that '' the scotch terrier is certainly the purest in point of breed and the ( smooth ) english seems to have been produced by a cross from him '' brown went on to describe the scotch terrier as '' low in stature , with a strong muscular body , short stout legs , a head large in proportion to the body '' and was '' generally of a sandy colour or black '' with a '' long , matted and hard '' coat although the scotch terrier described here is more generic than specific to a breed , it asserts the existence of a small , hard , rough-coated terrier developed for hunting small game in the scottish highlands in the early 19th century ; a description that shares characteristics with what was once known as the aberdeen terrier and is today known as the scottish terrier in addition , the paintings of sir edwin landseer and an 1835 lithograph entitled '' scottish terriers at work on a cairn in the west highlands '' both depict scottie type terriers very similar to those described in the first scottish terrier standard in the 19th century , the highlands of scotland , including the isle of skye , were abundant with terriers originally known by the generic term '' short-haired terriers '' or '' little skye terriers originally , the breeds were separated into two categories : dandie dinmont terriers and skye terriers ( not the skye terrier known today , but a generic name for a large group of terriers with differing traits all said to originate from the isle of skye ) the exhibition and judging of dogs required comparison to a breed standard and thus the appearance and temperament of the scottie was written down for the first time eventually , the skye terriers were further divided into what are known today as the scottish terrier , skye terrier , west highland white terrier and cairn terrier while fanciers sought to identify and standardize the breed and its description through the late 19th century , the scottish terrier was known by many different names : the highland , the cairn , diehard , and most often , the aberdeen terrier—named because of the abundant number of the dogs in the area and because a j roger rough , a dog owned by adamson , tartan , a dog owned by mr paynton piggott , bon accord , owned by messrs ludlow and bromfield , and splinter ii owned by mr ludlow , were early winners of dog exhibitions and are the four dogs from which all scottish terrier pedigrees ultimately began shortly afterwards , in 1879 , scotties were for the first time exhibited at alexander palace in england , while the following year they began to be classified in much the same way as is done today these four dogs and their offspring modified the look of the scottie , particularly the length of the head , closeness to the ground and the squareness of body scottish terriers have won best in show at the westminster kennel club dog show more than any other breed except for the wire fox terrier , a total of nine times jpg thumb left alt '' a painting of three dogs of different sizes , the smallest black , the mid sized one is brown and the largest , a bulldog is cream the scottie and the german shepherd are the only breeds of dog that have lived in the white house more than three times the scottie is also renowned for being featured in the popular board game , monopoly , as a player token when the game was first created in the 1930s , scotties were one of the most popular pets in the united states , and it is also one of the most popular monopoly game tokens , according to matt collins , vice president of marketing for hasbro the scottie had been a long-running unofficial mascot of the university , whose founder 's scottish heritage is also honored by the official athletic nickname of '' tartans ''
