armstrong , who in 1931 was ordained by the oregon conference of the church of god ( seventh-day ) , an adventist group , and began serving a congregation in eugene , oregon it was essentially a condensed church service on the air , with hymn singing featured along with armstrong 's message , and it was the launching point for what would become the radio church of god in 1947 , ambassador college was founded in pasadena by the church , and the campus served as the church 's headquarters in 1971 armstrong criticized teachings that christ would return in 1975 and that the church should flee to a '' place of safety '' in 1972 , as no man knew the time of christ 's return ( matthew 24:36 and 25:13 ) because of his strong emphasis on these prophetic dates , the church grew quickly in the late 1960s and , on january 5 , 1968 , was renamed the worldwide church of god armstrong 's son , garner ted armstrong , who had been given the responsibility to host the radio and later the television version of the world tomorrow , was formally disfellowshipped by his father in 1972 while church members were told at the time that the reason was ted armstrong 's opposition to some of his father 's teachings , ted armstrong later admitted that the actual reason was his relationships with many women he explained that those '' called '' by god , who believed the gospel of the kingdom , and received god 's spirit upon full-immersion baptism , became part of the true , biblical , 'church of god ' church headquarters and the former , beautiful , ambassador college , were located in pasadena , california , on prime real estate the church possessed several mansions in that area , known as millionaire 's row , and had built other large facilities on the thirty-acre property , including a spectacular concert hall ambassador auditorium , now the resident home of the pasadena symphony walls in the outer lobby were made of a rare pink onyx , and beautiful candelabras and chandeliers were on display , including two that had been owned by the shah of iran , hung from the gilt ceilings others followed , including john kerley 's top of the line ministry in 1978 ; the restoration church of god ; the church of god ( boise city ) in boise city , oklahoma ; marvin faulhaber 's sabbatarian , a group also known as church of god ( sabbatarian ) ; and the fountain of life fellowship of james and virginia porter these factions survived well past herbert armstrong 's death in 1986 , most retaining the name church of god because armstrong had pointed out that this is the name god calls his church in the bible armstrong did end up meeting with many world leaders to whom he would , appropriately , present expensive gifts , then preached to them simplistically , how that there were '' two ways '' of life , – one , of giving and the other - the way of getting the original name and design of human potential were conceived in the aftermath of armstrong 's poorly received 1975 in prophecy ! , a publication which caused accusations of false prophecy to spread like wildfire ( the use of the year 1975 was defended by church ministers as a device to explain biblical prophecy , by contrasting it with the scientific world 's declaration of 1975 as the year of technological '' utopia '' ) many members were disappointed that the events predicted in biblical prophecy , expounded and preached about by herbert armstrong , had not yet come to pass while the european union was an idea in the making , the nations of europe were far from united , as the union itself was still another 20 years in the future because church literature such as the wonderful world tomorrow , 1975 in prophecy ! , and many others had attempted to pinpoint the date of christ 's return , members continued to wait anxiously for the second coming garner ted spoke of greatly expanding the church 's media ministry on the model of the church of christ , scientist with its widely read christian science monitor to which herbert w in a report in the may 15 , 1972 , edition of time magazine , herbert armstrong was reported to have said that garner ted was '' in the bonds of satan '' the elder armstrong did not elaborate , but it was speculated that herbert was alluding to garner ted 's alleged problems with gambling and adultery with ambassador college co-eds , and to serious doctrinal differences herbert armstrong claimed that he did not approve of the establishment of the aicf , which rader set up ostensibly to give the elder armstrong a role as the '' ambassador for world peace without portfolio '' after being left a widower by the death of his wife , loma , eleven years earlier , armstrong married ramona martin , a woman nearly fifty years younger , in 1977 and moved to tucson , arizona while recovering from a heart attack several members in good standing with the worldwide church of god at the time prompted the state of california to investigate charges of malfeasance by rader and herbert w wayne cole , who was made temporary acting head of the church by herbert armstrong , that rader was attempting to take over the church after armstrong 's death , reasoning that the donated tithe money was the incentive and quite a '' magnet '' to stan rader in referring to the investigation of the california attorney general , rader wrote against the gates of hell : the threat to religious freedom in america in 1980 , in which he contended that his fight with the attorney general was solely about the government 's circumventing religious freedoms rather than about abuse of public trust or fraudulent misappropriation of tithe funds while remaining a member , he left the public spotlight as an attorney , retired , but continued to receive payments from the worldwide church of god on his lifetime contract , 300,000 per year , until his death from acute pancreatic cancer on july 2 , 2002 in the 2004 video production called to be free , greg albrecht , former dean of wcg 's ambassador college , declared herbert armstrong to be both a false prophet and a heresy its doctrinal summary highlights mainstream protestant beliefs such as the trinity , the death and resurrection of jesus christ , that faith in him is the only way to receive salvation , and that the bible is the divinely inspired and infallible word of god armstrong saw in it a description of national characteristics of contemporary descendants of jacob , and he deduced that the united states , the british commonwealth and several countries situated in northwestern europe were actually inhabited by the descendants of the ten lost tribes what is the worldwide church of god ? quoted at accessed 03-13-2007 the church strictly observed the saturday sabbath , jewish holidays described in the twenty-third chapter of leviticus , and strongly advocated the clean meats listed in leviticus 11 this book was the centerpiece of a titanic struggle between the philadelphia church of god and the remnant of the worldwide church of god under joseph tkach jr at that point , however , the leaders of the wcg decided to drop the case and give over not only mystery of the ages , but also several other works originally written by armstrong under armstrong 's leadership , the worldwide church of god was accused of being a cult with unorthodox and , to most christians , heretical teachings armstrong contended that all church doctrine could be proven simply and effectively through the bible , and that one did not need to '' accept on faith '' any of the worldwide church of god 's doctrinal beliefs however , the president is also a member of the doctrinal advisory team , and so he is aware of and involved in the activities of that committee , cell churches , is facilitated by district superintendents , each of which is responsible for a large number of churches in a geographical region ( such as florida or the northeast ) or in a specialized language group ( such as spanish-speaking congregations ) the early worldwide church of god used a three-tithe system , under which members were expected to give a tithe or ten percent '' of their increase '' , usually interpreted as a family 's income the first tithe , 10 percent of a member 's total income , was sent to church headquarters to finance '' the work '' , which was all operations of the church , as well as broadcasting and publishing the church 's message in contrast to many other churches ' religious services , the practice of the wcg was not to pass around offering plates during weekly church services but only during holy day church services ( seven days each year ) worldwide church of god organizational splits resulted in the establishment of the global church of god , the living church of god ( 1993 , 1998 ) , the united church of god ( 1995 ) , and the restored church of god ( 1998 ) 1989 ) church of the great god ( 1992 ) global church of god ( 1992 ) united church of god (
