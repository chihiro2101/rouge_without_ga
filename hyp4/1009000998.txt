by the folk interpretation in fact , the name seems to come from the legend regarding the migration of the first seven bashkir tribes from the syr-darya valley to the volga-ural region , the legend chants that the bashkirs , who dwelled in the arid syr-darya , were committed to the goddess of fertility of tengrism , ( referred as umay ) , umay , in order to reward them for their loyality , decided to donate them a prosperous , green , fertile land , protected by the legendary ural mountains ( in alignement with the famous bashkir epic poem '' ural-batyr '' ) , a wolf was sent to guide these tribes to their promised land , therefore the tribes followed the wolf , thus '' bash-qort '' ( '' head/lead ( ing ) '' + '' wolf '' ) from an ark of time of roughly 900 years , the bashkir language and idel tatar language , previously being completely different languages , '' melted '' into a series of dialects of a common volga turki language , the idel tatars and bashkirs tough are and always were two peoples of completely different origins , cultures and identities , but because of a shared common literary history in an ark of 900 years , the two languages ended up in a common language , spoken in different dialects with features depending on the people which spoke them this archaic version of a bashkir language would be more or less a dialect of the proto-kipchak language , however , since then , the bashkir language has been through a series of vowel and consonant shifts , which are a result of a common literary history shared with the idel tatar language since the formation of the cumania , when the volga bulgaria started to receive kipchaks influence and became the tatars , most likely between the 10th and 11th centuries the newborn independent bashkortostan had to quickly form its own armed forces in order to protect itself from both the red and white army , zeki velidi togan managed to get the formal support of the basmachi movement , however , the position of the republic between the white and red armies played in disadvantage of the bashkir armed forces , successively , the republic fell violently to the control of the red army , resulting into a massacre of ethnic bashkirs committed by the predominantly russian red army battalions in the late 16th and early 19th centuries , bashkirs occupied the territory from the river sylva in the north ; to the river heads of tobol in the east ; the mid-stream of the river yaik in the south ; in the middle and southern urals , the cis-urals including volga territory and trans-uralsto ; and the eastern bank of the volga river on the south-west at the beginning of the 20th century , most notably during the russian revolution , when bashkortostan and tatarstan became two different republics which rose up against the russian empire in an attempt to achieve independence , the bashkir and idel tatar language were defined as two separate literary languages , each of them based on the most distinct dialects of the volga kipchak language spoken by the bashkir and idel tatar people the dutch and the germans called the bashkirs '' northern amurs '' , probably because the population was not aware of who the bashkirs actually were or where they came from , therefore the usage of '' amurs '' in the name may be associated to a reference of something or someone coming from far away ; these battalions were considered as the liberators from the french , however modern russian military sources do not give credit to the bashkirs for these accomplishments this is how the legendary hero ural , possessing titanic power , overcoming incredible difficulties , destroys the deva , and obtains '' living water '' ( the idea of water in nature , in the pre-islamic bashkir panteon of the turkic mythology , is known as a spirit of life , thus the water is what gives life ) the first report about bashkirs might have been found in the chinese chronicle book of sui : around 40 turkic tiele tribes were named ( 636 ad ) in '' a narration about the tiele people '' ; bashkirs might have included within that narration : if the tribal name 比干 ( mandarin bǐgān x -kɑn ) were read as 比千 ( bĭqiān x t͡sʰen ) , according to chinese scholar rui chuanming in the 7th century , bashkirs are also mentioned in '' ashkharatsuyts '' after the arrival of islam between the bashkir people in 1200s , the arabic script was adopted to write the language , it was continued to use until 1928 , when stalinist policies imposed the use an experimental latin alphabet developed by russian linguists , this alphabet does not resemble the modern common turkic latin alphabet , but is a weird bad-looking experiment which was effectively more of a mix between latin , cyrillic and other symbols ( these sources may have confused bashkirs with hungarians , since the area of modern bashkortostan is often referred as '' magna hungaria '' , the zone where the magyar tribes dwelled before their migration to europe ; it is believed that bashkirs may have come into contact with these magyar tribes , since some of the northern tribes of the modern bashkirs do have genetic correspondence with hungarians ) some of these poems became important on a continental level , for example the poem of the '' ural-batyr '' , which tells the tale of the legendary hero ural , is the origin of the name of the ural mountains , the natural border between europe and asia he was named people 's poet of the bashkir autonomous soviet socialist republic ( 1963 ) , hero of socialist labour ( 1979 ) , and winner of the lenin prize ( 1984 ) and the ussr state prize ( 1972 ) zagir ismagilov , composer and educator murtaza rakhimov , first president of bashkortostan lyasan utiasheva , ( bashkir mother ) tv show host , socialite and former rhythmic gymnast alina ibragimova , violinist morgenshtern , rapper and internet personality as a result , on 15 november 1917 , the bashkir regional ( central ) shuro ( council ) , ruled by the notorious zeki velidi togan proclaimed the establishment of the first independent bashkir republic in areas of predominantly bashkir population : orenburg , perm , samara , ufa provinces and the autonomous entity bashkurdistan on november 15 , 1917 the first appearance of a '' bashkir '' language is dated back to the 9th century , in the form of stone inscription using a runic alphabet , most likely , this alphabet derives from the yenisey variant of the old turkic script according to ibn fadlan , the bashkirs worshipped twelve gods : winter , summer , rain , wind , trees , people , horses , water , night , day , death , heaven and earth , and the most prominent , the sky god for example , the dialects spoken by bashkirs , tend to have an accent which mostly resembles other kipchak languages , like kyrgyz , kazakh , nogai , karakalpak , and many other languages of the kipchak sub-group , while the dialects spoken by idel tatars , have accents more resembling the original volga bulgaria spoken before the cumans however , even after the separation , the bolsheviks and stalin , who was in charge of nationalities in the new communist regime , considered even the red bashkirs as too separatist , therefore they attempted to set up a great idel-ural soviet , merging bashkirs with idel tatars and chuvashes on march 31 , 1992 bashkortostan signed a federal agreement on the delimitation of powers and areas of jurisdiction and the nature of contractual relations between the authorities of the russian federation and the authorities of the sovereign republics in its composition including the republic of bashkortostan ural did not drink the '' living water '' , but instead of drinking it to live eternally , he decided to sparkle it around himself , died and donated eternity to the world , the withered earth turned green , ural died and from his body , the ural mountains originated ivan kirillov formed a plan to build the fort to be called orenburg at orsk at the confluence of the or river and the ural river , south-east of the urals where the bashkir , kalmyk and kazakh lands met a group of bashkirs from the burzyansky and abzelilovsky districts of the republic of bashkortostan in the idel-ural region who belong to the r1a subclade r-sur51 are the closest kin of the hungarian árpád dynasty , from which got separated 2000 years ago majority of the poems of bashkir mythology have been written down and published as books at the beginning of the 20th century , these poems compose a great part of the literature of the bashkir people and are important examples of further-developed turkic culture other poems constitute a great part of the bashkir national identity , other tales apart from the ural batyr are '' akbuzat '' , '' qara yurga '' , '' aqhaq qola '' , '' kongur buga '' , '' uzaq tuzaq '' , and many others the book of sui might be speaking about the precursors of these tribes when the turkic peoples were still wandering in south siberia from the 9th century , during the migration of the bashkirs to the volga-ural , the first arab and persian written reports about bashkirs commence the migration to the valley of the southern urals happened between the end of the 9th century and the beginning of the 10th century , in parallel to the great kipchak migration to the north the third world is the underground world , where the devas , or also singular , deva or div , live , incarnated as a snake , the incarnation of the dark forces , who live underground the name of the people of bashkort has been known since the 10th century , most researchers etymologize the name as '' main/leader/head '' ( bash ) + '' wolf '' ( qort , old archaic word for the animal ) , thus '' wolf-leader '' ( from the totemic hero ancestor ) it includes an heavenly , earthly and undergroundly ( underwater ) trinity : on the sky , the heavenly king samrau resides , his wives are the sun and the moon , he has two daughters , umay and aykhylu , who are incarnated either in the form of birds or beautiful girls frank , '' islamic historiography and '' bulghar '' identity among the tatars and bashkirs '' , brill , 1998 the final assertion of islam among the bashkirs occurred in the 1320s and 1330s during the golden horde period the 2010 russian census recorded 1,584,554 ethnic bashkirs in russia , of which 1,172,287 bashkirs live in bashkortostan ( 29.5 % of the total population of the republic ) the formation of the bashkir people was played by turkic tribes of south siberian central asian origin , who , before migrating to the southern urals , wandered for a considerable time in the syr darya steppes modern day central-southern kazakhstan , coming into contact with the pechenegs and kimak-kipchak tribes the orenburg bashkir qoroltays were not considered sufficiently politically orthodox by the soviet government , therefore the orenburg area was separated from the bashkir assr , a separate council was put in charge of the area ( the orenburg soviet ) the bashkir poems , like the epic creations of other peoples , find origin in the ancient turkic mythology , in fact the bashkir epic tale culture can be considered a more developed and expanded version of old turkic epic culture the bashkirs , according to ibn fadlan , were a warlike and powerful people , which he and his companions ( a total of five thousand people , including military protection ) '' bewared therefore it is possible to note that the bashkir people originates from the same tribes which compose the modern kazakhs , kyrgyzes and nogais , but there has been a considerable cultural and a small ethnic exchange with oghuz tribes member of the bashkir national liberation movement , one of the members of the bashkir government ( 1917–1919 ) shagit hudayberdin , communist revolutionary tagir kusimov , soviet military leader mustai karim , bashkir soviet poet , writer and playwright ibn rustah , a contemporary of abu zayd al-balkhi , observed that bashkirs were an independent people occupying territories on both sides of the ural mountains ridge between volga , kama , and tobol rivers and upstream of the ural river in 1740 a report was made of bashkir losses which listed : killed : 16,893 ; sent to baltic regiments and fleet : 3,236 ; women & children distributed ( presumably as serfs ) : 8,382 with a grand total of 28,511
