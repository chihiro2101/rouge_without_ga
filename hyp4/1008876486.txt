the exorcist – although never officially cut or banned in the uk , several attempts to release the film on video were thwarted by bbfc censor james ferman , who cited both the age of the possessed girl ( as she was under 12 , the film might have had significant appeal to underaged viewers ) and reports of incidents of hysteria involving young women ( leading to concerns that the film might cause severe emotional problems for those who believed in demonic possession ) as obstacles to a home release claims , since proven at best to be speculative , at worst outright media fabrication , relating to the hungerford massacre and the murder of james bulger ( where the 1991 film child 's play 3 was erroneously held up as influencing the perpetrators , possibly prompting the 1992 film mikey to be prohibited in the uk ) , provided an additional impetus to restrict films and as late as december 1997 , the board claimed it '' has never relaxed its guidelines on video violence , which remain the strictest in the world '' public awareness of the availability of these videos began in early 1982 , when vipco ( video instant picture company ) , the uk distributors of the driller killer , a 1979 splatter film , took out full-page advertisements in a number of specialist video magazines , depicting the video 's explicit cover ; an action which resulted in a large number of complaints to the advertising standards agency the bbfc had been established in 1912 , essentially as an unintended consequence of the cinematograph act 1909 , and it was their responsibility to pass films intended for the cinema for certification within the united kingdom ( though local councils were the final arbiters ) a clockwork orange – often believed to have been banned by the bbfc , it was actually stanley kubrick himself who withdrew the film from exhibition in the uk in 1973 on police advice after receiving death threats toward himself and his family , as well as disliking reports found in the british press that the film was responsible for copycat violence section 3 titles were liable to be confiscated under a '' less obscene '' charge , which allowed the police to seize a film they considered obscene and as long as the dealer cooperated , they legally admit that the articles are obscene and therefore escape any personal prosecution at the time of the introduction of domestic video recorders in the united kingdom during the 1970s , there was no legislation specifically designed to regulate video content , apart from the obscene publications act 1959 which had been amended in 1977 to cover erotic films the dpp recognised that the current system , where the interpretation of obscenity was down to individual chief constables , was inconsistent and decided to publish a list that contained names of films that had already resulted in a successful prosecution or where the dpp had already filed charges against the video 's distributors the tv show the young ones included an entire episode entitled '' nasty '' , in which the characters rent a video recorder specifically to watch a '' video nasty '' ( with the fictitious name sex with the headless corpse of the virgin astronaut ) , and which featured a lip synched performance of '' nasty '' by the damned if the director of public prosecutions ( dpp ) felt that a certain video might be in breach of the act , then a prosecution could be brought against the film 's producers , distributors and retailers under the 1984 act , the british board of film censors was renamed the british board of film classification and became responsible for the certification of both cinema and video releases such permission was not always granted , and in the case of the release of the exorcist in 1973 , a number of enterprising managers of cinemas where permission had been granted set about providing buses to transport cinema-goers from other localities where the film could not be seen as well as the low-budget horror films the act was originally intended to curb , a number of high-profile films which had passed cinema certification fell foul of the act whilst some of these films had been passed by the british board of film censors ( bbfc ) for cinema release , others had been refused certification which effectively banned them popular culture backlash against the video recordings act included the may 1984 release of '' nasty '' by the punk-goth outfit the damned , who celebrated the condemned genre with the lyrics '' i fell in love with a video nasty '' however , under the terms of the act the police were empowered to seize videos from retailers if they were of the opinion that the material was in breach of the act as part of this process the board could recommend , or demand in the more extreme cases , that certain cuts be made to the film in order for it to gain a particular certification the main difference between section 2 and 3 is that video dealers or distributors could be personally prosecuted in court for holding the film under section 2 but not under section 3 , where the obscenity is admitted through forfeiting the material following a successful theatrical re-release in 1998 and ferman 's retirement as censor in january 1999 , the film was submitted for home video release for the first time in february 1999 , and was passed uncut with an '' 18 '' certificate omnibus press : 13 a few months later go video , the distributors of the already-controversial 1980 italian film cannibal holocaust , in an effort to boost publicity and generate sales that ultimately backfired , wrote anonymously to mary whitehouse of the mediawatch-uk complaining about their own film in particular , the exorcist , which was made available by warner home video in december 1981 , was not submitted for video certification by the bbfc and was withdrawn from shelves in 1986 with the passing of the video recordings act , the films on the list could be prosecuted for both obscenity and not being classified the exorcist was granted an uncut 18 video certificate on 25 february 1999 , followed by the texas chain saw massacre in august , and several official '' nasties '' were passed in the early 2000s either uncut or with cuts restricted to sexual violence or actual animals being harmed the video retailers association were alarmed by the apparently random seizures and asked the dpp to provide a guideline for the industry so that stockists could be made aware of the titles which were liable to be confiscated it was quickly remade by most of the original production team and released in cinemas , and was released on vhs at the height of the video nasties controversy , quickly becoming associated with them in the media '' paul duncan , stanley kubrick : the complete films , page 136 ( taschen gmbh , 2003 ) after kubrick 's death , the film was re-released uncut at cinemas in the uk in 2000 , and thereafter on both vhs and dvd child 's play 3 – the film became notorious in the united kingdom when it was suggested it might have inspired the real-life murder of british child james bulger ( a suggestion rejected by officers investigating the case ) and the murder of suzanne capper titles on the section 3 list could not be prosecuted for obscenity but were liable to seizure and confiscation under a '' less obscene '' charge 39 films were successfully prosecuted under the obscene publications act but some of these films have been subsequently cut and then approved for release by the bbfc dealers could be fined or jailed and the film itself would be declared obscene if the prosecution was successful , meaning it could not be distributed or sold in the uk until the obscenity was quashed the obscene publications act defined obscenity as that which may '' tend to deprave and corrupt persons who are likely , having regard to all relevant circumstances , to read , see or hear the matter contained or embodied in it '' furthermore , to attribute powerful suggestive qualities to a film is at odds with the scientifically accepted view that , even after deep hypnosis , in a posthypnotic state , people can not be made to do things which are at odds with their natures ultimately , the list became obsolete when the video recordings act came into force , and since 2001 , several of the films have been released uncut in 1986 , the dáil select committee on criminal lawlessness and vandalism issued a report '' controls on video nasties '' recommending that the powers of the film censor 's office be extended to videos antropophagus ( original title : antropophagus , also known as anthropophagous , antropofago , the grim reaper , man beast , man-eater , and the savage island ) – released with approximately 8 minutes of pre-edits as the grim reaper in 2002 the increased possibility of videos falling into the hands of children required that film classification for video be a separate process from cinema classification 10 films remain banned in the uk because they have not yet been resubmitted for classification by any distributors or have been rejected for classification major film distributors were initially reluctant to embrace the new medium of video for fear of piracy and the video market became flooded with low-budget horror films last house on dead end street – also known as the fun house , this film the funhouse as a '' video nasty '' when the bbfc added the funhouse to the list in the majority of cases below where cuts were made , they were scenes of real-life animal cruelty and/or excessive violence to women , both of which are still regarded with some degree of severity by the bbfc the original tv film was made by the bbc , but they later decided not to broadcast it owing to the violence and suicides in the film a large number of these movies caused additional controversy with the cover art of the original big box releases seen in the video shops of the early 1980s as well as not passing any film liable to be found obscene , the bbfc imposed additional bans and cuts on films such as the texas chain saw massacre in 2008 , there was another brief media frenzy over such films that had years earlier been approved for release by the bbfc , in particular ss experiment camp however the choice of titles seized appeared to be completely arbitrary , one raid famously netting a copy of the dolly parton musical the best little whorehouse in texas ( 1982 ) under the mistaken belief it was pornographic films released on video before that date had to be re-submitted for classification within the following three years a number of films spent a short time on this list because their prosecutions failed shortly after publication or because it was decided that prosecution was not worth pursuing the original print was released again with 3 minutes cut in 2010 , and the film again received 1 minute 41 seconds of cuts for the 2020 blu-ray release a bay of blood ( original title : reazione a catena , also known as twitch of the death nerve , blood bath and simply bay of blood ) – originally refused a cinema certificate in 1972 all video releases after 1 september 1985 had to comply with the act and be submitted for classification by the bbfc the lack of regulation of the domestic video market was in sharp contrast to the regulation of material intended for public screenings a supplementary list was issued along with the official list which featured a list of so-called '' section 3 video nasties '' in the early 1980s , in certain police constabularies , notably greater manchester police which was at that time run by devout christian chief constable james anderton , police raids on video hire shops increased prisoner of the cannibal god ( original title : la montagna del dio cannibale , also known as mountain of the cannibal god and slave of the cannibal god ) — originally passed with cuts for cinema the film had previously been released on video in 1981 , uncertificated , by warner home video the 33 films that could n't be prosecuted under section 2 automatically became section 3 titles and were still seized by the police the television programme spitting image parodied the video nasties with their sketch of a sickeningly nice , low-budget film entitled a video '' nicie '' it was given an uncut theatrical re-release in 1995 but two subsequent attempts to pass the film for video in 1999 resulted in bbfc rejections re-released in a longer re-edited format in 2003 which reframed the rape scenes but was cut by 43 seconds to the second rape scene by the bbfc amid the growing concern , the sunday times brought the issue to a wider audience in may 1982 with an article entitled '' how high street horror is invading the home '' stop this debasing film -times online this coincided with an attempt by mps julian brazier and keith vaz to pass a law allowing mps greater powers to tighten bbfc guidelines or force an appeal of a release the decision was made by the bbfc which refused to issue it with a uk release certificate in 1996 33 of the section 2 films had unsuccessful prosecutions and were subsequently dropped from the list and placed onto section 3 mikey – the film was withdrawn from release in the united kingdom following the james bulger murder in liverpool in 1993 nightmare maker ( also known as night warning and butcher , baker , nightmare maker ) — refused a video certificate in 1987 under the title the evil protege island of death ( original title : ta pedhia tou dhiavolou ,

the forgotten ( 1973 film ) ( also known as the forgotten ) — originally passed with cuts for cinema the departure of james ferman from the bbfc may also have allowed some long-proscribed films to be re-appraised around this time among modern films , many , such as the hostel and saw series , contain brutal , graphic violence but have passed through uncut quoting kubrick , '' to try and fasten any
