these bacteria can not survive in air but the moist , warm , anaerobic conditions of buried waste that contains a high source of carbon & ndash ; in inert landfills , paper and glue used in the fabrication of products such as drywall can provide a rich source of carbon & ndash ; is an excellent environment for the formation of hydrogen sulfide as organic matter decays under low-oxygen ( or hypoxic ) conditions ( such as in swamps , eutrophic lakes or dead zones of oceans ) , sulfate-reducing bacteria will use the sulfates present in the water to oxidize the organic matter , producing hydrogen sulfide as waste in landfill , the burial of organic matter rapidly leads to the production of anaerobic digestion within the waste mass and , with the humid atmosphere and relatively high temperature that accompanies biodegradation , biogas is produced as soon as the air within the waste mass has been reduced hydrogen sulfide is created by the human body in small doses through bacterial breakdown of proteins containing sulfur in the intestinal tract , therefore it contributes to the characteristic odor of flatulence in industrial anaerobic digestion processes , such as wastewater treatment or the anaerobic digestion , hydrogen sulfide can be formed from the reduction of sulfate and the degradation of amino acids and proteins within organic compounds image : deposit from hydrogen sulphide.jpg thumb deposit of sulfur on a rock , caused by volcanic gas small amounts of hydrogen sulfide occur in crude petroleum , but natural gas can contain up to 30 % a valve to a pipe that carried chicken manure , straw and gypsum to the compost fuel for the mushroom growing operation became clogged , and as workers unclogged the valve in a confined space without proper ventilation the hydrogen sulfide that had built up due to anaerobic decomposition of the material was released , poisoning the workers in the surrounding area treatment involves immediate inhalation of amyl nitrite , injections of sodium nitrite , or administration of 4-dimethylaminophenol in combination with inhalation of pure oxygen , administration of bronchodilators to overcome eventual bronchospasm , and in some cases hyperbaric oxygen therapy ( hbot ) aluminium sulfide , phosphorus pentasulfide , silicon disulfide liberate hydrogen sulfide upon exposure to water : :6 & nbsp ; h 2 o + al 2 s 3 → 3 & nbsp ; h 2 s + 2 & nbsp ; al ( oh ) 3 this gas is also produced by heating sulfur with solid organic compounds and by reducing sulfurated organic compounds with hydrogen reversibly sodium sulfide in the presence of acids turns into hydrosulfides and hydrogen sulfide ; this supplies hydrosulfides in organic solutions and is utilized in the production of thiophenol in 2011 it was reported that increased concentration of , possibly due to oil field practices , was observed in the bakken formation crude and presented challenges such as '' health and environmental risks , corrosion of wellbore , added expense with regard to materials handling and pipeline equipment , and additional refinement requirements '' hydrogen sulfide is most commonly obtained by its separation from sour gas , which is natural gas with a high content of freshwater springs rich in hydrogen sulfide are mainly home to invertebrates , but also include a small number of fish : cyprinodon bobmilleri ( a pupfish from mexico ) , limia sulphurophila ( a poeciliid from the dominican republic ) , gambusia eurystoma ( a poeciliid from mexico ) , and a few poecilia ( poeciliids from mexico ) this mode of photosynthesis is older than the mode of cyanobacteria , algae , and plants , which uses water as electron donor and liberates oxygen in the absence of oxygen , sulfur-reducing and sulfate-reducing bacteria derive energy from redox hydrogen or organic molecules by reducing elemental sulfur or sulfate to hydrogen sulfide catalysts used in hydrodesulfurization are routinely activated with hydrogen sulfide , and the behavior of metallic catalysts used in other parts of a refining is also modified using hydrogen sulfide if there is a source of sulfate bearing material , such as plasterboard or natural gypsum ( calcium sulphate dihydrate ) , under anaerobic conditions sulfate reducing bacteria converts this to hydrogen sulfide in 1975 , a hydrogen sulfide release from an oil drilling operation in denver city , texas , killed nine people and caused the state legislature to focus on the deadly hazards of the gas hydrogen sulfide is slightly soluble in water and acts as a weak acid ( pk a & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 6.9 in 0.01–0.1 & nbsp ; mol/litre solutions at 18 & nbsp ; °c ) , giving the hydrosulfide ion ( also written hydrogen sulfide can be present naturally in well water , often as a result of the action of sulfate-reducing bacteria since hydrogen sulfide occurs naturally in the body , the environment , and the gut , enzymes exist to detoxify it this is due to providing a warm environment sustainable for sulfur bacteria and maintaining the reaction which interacts between sulfate in the water and the water heater anode , which is usually made from magnesium metal dietary amino acids , such as methionine and cysteine serve as the primary substrates for the transulfuration pathways and in the production of hydrogen sulfide other bacteria liberate hydrogen sulfide from sulfur-containing amino acids ; this gives rise to the odor of rotten eggs and contributes to the odor of flatulence in this model of the origin of life on earth , geologically produced hydrogen sulfide is postulated as an electron donor driving the reduction of carbon dioxide although very pungent at first ( it smells like rotten eggs ) , it quickly deadens the sense of smell - creating a temporary incident of anosmia - so victims may be unaware of its presence until it is too late 0.00047 & nbsp ; ppm or 0.47 & nbsp ; ppb is the odor threshold , the point at which 50 % of a human panel can detect the presence of an odor without being able to identify it in an attempt to save the men , a firefighter who entered the hole without his air tank ( because he could not fit through the hole with it ) collapsed within seconds and had to be rescued by a colleague volcanoes and some hot springs ( as well as cold springs ) emit some , where it probably arises via the hydrolysis of sulfide minerals , i.e exposure to lower concentrations can result in eye irritation , a sore throat and cough , nausea , shortness of breath , and fluid in the lungs ( pulmonary edema ) in the body acts as a gaseous signaling molecule which is known to inhibit complex iv of the mitochondrial electron transport chain which effectively reduces atp generation and biochemical activity within cells in such processes , the hydrogen sulfide is first converted to an ammonium salt , whereas the natural gas is unaffected a dump of toxic waste containing hydrogen sulfide is believed to have caused 17 deaths and thousands of illnesses in abidjan , on the west african coast , in the 2006 côte d'ivoire toxic waste dump in general , hydrogen sulfide acts as a reducing agent , especially in the presence of base , which forms sh − some of the hydrogen sulfide will react with metal ions in the water to produce metal sulfides , which are not water-soluble a suspended animation-like state has been induced in rodents with the use of hydrogen sulfide , resulting in hypothermia with a concomitant reduction in metabolic rate hydrogen sulfide is a broad-spectrum poison , meaning that it can poison several different systems in the body , although the nervous system is most affected hydrogen sulfide is lethal to most animals , but a few highly specialized species ( extremophiles ) do thrive in habitats that are rich in this compound at 100–150 & nbsp ; ppm the olfactory nerve is paralyzed after a few inhalations , and the sense of smell disappears , often together with awareness of danger
