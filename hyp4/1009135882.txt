some of the technical drawing tools include pencils , pens and their ink , straightedges , t-squares , french curves , triangles , rulers , protractors , dividers , compasses , scales , erasers , and tacks or push pins the english idiom '' to go back to the drawing board '' , which is a figurative phrase meaning to rethink something altogether , was inspired by the literal act of discovering design errors during production and returning to a drawing board to revise the engineering drawing producing drawings usually involves creating an original that is then reproduced , generating multiple copies to be distributed to the shop floor , vendors , company archives , and so on the classic reproduction methods involved blue and white appearances ( whether blueprint or whiteprint ) , which is why engineering drawings were long called , and even today are still often called , '' blueprints '' or '' bluelines '' , even though those terms are anachronism from a literal perspective , since most copies of engineering drawings today are made by more modern methods ( often inkjet or laser printing ) that yield black or multicolour lines on white paper drawings convey the following critical information : geometry – the shape of the object ; represented as views ; how the object will look when it is viewed from various angles , such as front , top , side , etc phantom – ( not shown ) are alternately long- and double short-dashed thin lines used to represent a feature or component that is not part of the specified part or assembly a multiview projection is a type of orthographic projection that shows the object as it looks from the front , right , left , top , bottom , or back ( e.g the 3d object is projected into 2d '' paper '' space as if you were looking at a radiograph of the object : the top view is under the front view , the right view is at the left of the front view in third-angle projection , the parallel projectors originate as if radiated from the far side of the object and pass through the 3d object to project a 2d image onto the orthogonal plane in front of it the views of the 3d object are like the panels of a box that envelopes the object , and the panels pivot as they open up flat into the plane of the drawing thus the left view is placed on the left and the top view on the top ; and the features closest to the front of the 3d object will appear closest to the front view in the drawing in addition to the six principal views ( front , back , top , bottom , right side , left side ) , any auxiliary views or sections may be included as serve the purposes of part definition and its communication the true size and shape of any feature in an engineering drawing can only be known when the line of sight ( los ) is perpendicular to the plane being referenced an oblique projection is a simple type of graphical projection used for producing pictorial , two-dimensional images of three-dimensional objects : it projects an image by intersecting parallel rays ( projectors ) from the three-dimensional source object with the drawing surface ( projection plan ) the two most characteristic features of perspective are that objects are drawn : smaller as their distance from the observer increases foreshortened : the size of an object 's dimensions along the line of sight are relatively shorter than dimensions across the line of sight and yet , on the other hand , there is another general principle of engineering drawing that nearly diametrically opposes all this effort and intent—that is , the principle that users are not to scale the drawing to infer a dimension not labeled the second principle—that even though scaling the drawing will usually work , one should nevertheless never do it—serves several goals , such as enforcing total clarity regarding who has authority to discern design intent , and preventing erroneous scaling of a drawing that was never drawn to scale to begin with ( which is typically labeled '' drawing not to scale '' or '' scale : nts '' ) when a user is forbidden from scaling the drawing , s/he must turn instead to the engineer ( for the answers that the scaling would seek ) , and s/he will never erroneously scale something that is inherently unable to be accurately scaled when part definition is defined mathematically via a solid model , the assertion that one can not interrogate the model—the direct analog of '' scaling the drawing '' —becomes ridiculous ; because when part definition is defined this way , it is not possible for a drawing or model to be '' not to scale '' a 2d pencil drawing can be inaccurately foreshortened and skewed ( and thus not to scale ) , yet still be a completely valid part definition as long as the labeled dimensions are the only dimensions used , and no scaling of the drawing by the user occurs ( for example , a sketch of a hole that is clearly not round still accurately defines the part as having a true round hole , as long as the label says '' 10mm dia '' , because the '' dia '' implicitly but objectively tells the user that the skewed drawn circle is a symbol representing a perfect circle ) but if a mathematical model—essentially , a vector graphic—is declared to be the official definition of the part , then any amount of '' scaling the drawing '' can make sense ; there may still be an error in the model , in the sense that what was intended is not depicted ( modeled ) ; but there can be no error of the '' not to scale '' type—because the mathematical vectors and curves are replicas , not symbols , of the part features in the past , prints were plotted on a plotter to exact scale ratios , and the user could know that a line on the drawing 15mm long corresponded to a 30mm part dimension because the drawing said '' 1:2 '' in the '' scale '' box of the title block today , in the era of ubiquitous desktop printing , where original drawings or scaled prints are often scanned on a scanner and saved as a pdf file , which is then printed at any percent magnification that the user deems handy ( such as '' fit to paper size '' ) , users have pretty much given up caring what scale ratio is claimed in the '' scale '' box of the title block however , the international organization for standardization ( iso ) called for four pen widths and set a colour code for each : 0.25 ( white ) , 0.35 ( yellow ) , 0.5 ( brown ) , 0.7 ( blue ) ; these nibs produced lines that related to various text character heights and the iso paper sizes all iso paper sizes have the same aspect ratio , one to the square root of 2 , meaning that a document designed for any given size can be enlarged or reduced to any other size and will fit perfectly the iso character set ( font ) has a seriffed one , a barred seven , an open four , six , and nine , and a round topped three , that improves legibility when , for example , an a0 drawing has been reduced to a1 or even a3 ( and perhaps enlarged back or reproduced/faxed/ microfilmed & c ) when cad drawings became more popular , especially using us american software , such as autocad , the nearest font to this iso standard font was romantic simplex ( romans ) - a proprietary shx font ) with a manually adjusted width factor ( over ride ) to make it look as near to the iso lettering for the drawing board the title block ( t/b , tb ) is an area of the drawing that conveys header-type information about the drawing , such as : drawing title ( hence the name '' title block '' ) drawing number part number ( s ) name of the design activity ( corporation , government agency , etc ) identifying code of the design activity ( such as a cage code ) address of the design activity ( such as city , state/province , country ) measurement units of the drawing ( for example , inches , millimeters ) default tolerances for dimension callouts where no tolerance is specified boilerplate callouts of general specs intellectual property rights warning traditional locations for the title block are the bottom right ( most commonly ) or the top right or center the next assembly block , often also referred to as '' where used '' or sometimes '' effectivity block '' , is a list of higher assemblies where the product on the current drawing is used general notes ( g/n , gn ) apply generally to the contents of the drawing , as opposed to applying only to certain part numbers or certain surfaces or features the field of the drawing ( f/d , fd ) is the main body or main area of the drawing , excluding the title block , rev block , p/l and so on the list of materials ( l/m , lm , lom ) , bill of materials ( b/m , bm , bom ) , or parts list ( p/l , pl ) is a ( usually tabular ) list of the materials used to make a part , and/or the parts used to make an assembly some drawings call out dimensions with parameter names ( that is , variables , such a '' a '' , '' b '' , '' c '' ) , then tabulate rows of parameter values for each part number traditional locations for parameter tables , when such tables are used , are floating near the edges of the field of the drawing , either near the title block or elsewhere along the edges of the field often a drawing is divided into zones by an alphanumeric grid , with zone labels along the margins , such as a , b , c , d up the sides and 1,2,3,4,5,6 along the top and bottom an engineering drawing is a legal document ( that is , a legal instrument ) , because it communicates all the needed information about '' what is wanted '' to the people who will expend resources turning the idea into a reality it is thus a part of a contract ; the purchase order and the drawing together , as well as any ancillary documents ( engineering change orders ecos , called-out specs ) , constitute the contract in mbd , the information captured by the cad software app is fed automatically into a cam app ( computer-aided manufacturing ) , which ( with or without postprocessing apps ) creates code in other languages such as g-code to be executed by a cnc machine tool ( numerical control ) , 3d printer , or ( increasingly ) a hybrid machine tool that uses both thus today it is often the case that the information travels from the mind of the designer into the manufactured component without having ever been codified by an engineering drawing the term '' technical data package '' ( tdp ) is now used to refer to the complete package of information ( in one medium or another ) that communicates information from design to production ( such as 3d-model datasets , engineering drawings , engineering change orders ( ecos ) , spec revisions and addenda , and so on ) it still takes cad/cam programmers , cnc setup workers , and cnc operators to do manufacturing , as well as other people such as quality assurance staff ( inspectors ) and logistics staff ( for materials handling , shipping-and-receiving , and front office functions ) when proper procedures are being followed , a clear chain of precedence is always documented , such that when a person looks at a drawing , s/he is told by a note thereon that this drawing is not the governing instrument ( because the mbd dataset is ) in these cases , the drawing is still a useful document , although legally it is classified as '' for reference only '' , meaning that if any controversies or discrepancies arise , it is the mbd dataset , not the drawing , that governs
