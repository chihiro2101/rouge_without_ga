however , it is not uncommon to see either the slowest swimmer racing in the second slot ( creating an order of second-fastest , slowest , third-fastest , and then fastest ) , or an order from slowest to fastest ( an order of slowest , third-fastest , second-fastest , fastest ) fina rules require that a foot of the second , third or fourth swimmer must be contacting the platform while ( and before ) the incoming teammate is touching the wall ; the starting swimmer may already be in motion , however , which saves 0.6–1.0 seconds compared to a regular start in medley swimming , each swimmer uses a different stroke ( in this order ) : backstroke , breaststroke , butterfly , and freestyle , with the added limitation that the freestyle swimmer can not use any of the first three strokes note that this order is different from that for the individual medley , in which a single swimmer swims butterfly , backstroke , breaststroke , and freestyle in a single race , in that order the three standard relays raced at the olympics are the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay , 4 × 200 m freestyle relay and 4 × 100 m medley relay mixed-gendered relays were introduced at the 2014 fina world swimming championships ( 25 m ) ( 4 × 50 m freestyle and medley ) and the 2015 world aquatics championships ( 4 × 100 m freestyle and medley ) in athletics , the two standard relays are the 4 × 100 metres relay and the 4 × 400 metres relay traditionally , the 4 × 400 m relay finals are the last event of a track meet , and is often met with a very enthusiastic crowd , especially if the last leg is a close race for example , if a team ran a 3-minute 4 × 400 , it does not mean every runner on the team has to run a 45-second open 400 , because a person starts accelerating before they have the baton , therefore allowing for slightly slower overall open 400 times in sprint relays , runners typically use a '' blind handoff '' , where the second runner stands on a spot predetermined in practice and starts running when the first runner hits a visual mark on the track ( usually a smaller triangle ) 170.6 ) making an improper baton pass , especially when not passing in the exchange zone false starting ( usually once but sometimes twice ) improperly overtaking another competitor preventing another competitor from passing wilfully impeding , improperly crossing the course , or in any other way interfering with another competitor based on the speed of the runners , the generally accepted strategy used in setting up a four-person relay team is : second-fastest , third-fastest , slowest , then fastest ( anchor ) ; however some teams ( usually middle school or young high school ) use second-fastest , slowest , third-fastest , then the fastest ( anchor ) a mixed version was introduced at the 2019 iaaf world relays , it consist of a race in which two men and two women on each team , are running a 110 m hurdles the distance medley relay consists of four legs run at distances of 1200 , 400 , 800 , and 1,600 metres , in that order the sprint medley relay usually consists of four legs run at distances of 400 , 200 , 200 , and 800 metres , though a more uncommon variant of 200 , 100 , 100 and 400 metres ( sometimes called a short sprint medley ) also exists in the obverse of the coin three modern athletes run , holding their batons while in the background three ancient athletes are shown running a race known as the dolichos ( a semi-endurance race of approximately 3,800 metres ' distance ) there are two major relays in orienteering : tiomila in april/may in sweden jukola relay in june in finland there are other relays in autumn with requirements about the age and gender distributions : halikko relay , near salo , finland 25-manna , near stockholm , sweden
