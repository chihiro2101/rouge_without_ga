these events were subsequently treated by the united states and the member nations of nato as an act of war and terrorism the aircraft suffered an explosive decompression from an incorrectly repaired aft pressure bulkhead , which failed in mid flight , destroying most of its vertical stabilizer and severing all of the hydraulic lines , making the 747 virtually uncontrollable 329 : on june 23 , 1985 , air india flight 182 , a boeing 747 en route from toronto and montreal to london and delhi , crashed off the southwest coast of ireland when a bomb exploded in the cargo hold 298 : on july 17 , 2014 , malaysia airlines flight 17 , a boeing 777-200er , flying from amsterdam to kuala lumpur with 298 people on board , was shot down in an area of eastern ukraine near the ukraine/russian border during the war in donbass it remains the deadliest commercial aircraft accident in united states history , and was also the country 's deadliest aviation disaster until the september 11 attacks in 2001 270 : on december 21 , 1988 , pan am flight 103 , a boeing 747-121 bound for new york–jfk from london–heathrow with continued service to detroit , was destroyed by a terrorist bomb over the town of lockerbie , scotland all 243 passengers and 16 crew , and 11 people on the ground ( all residents of sherwood crescent , lockerbie ) , died , making it the worst terrorist attack involving an aircraft in the uk and the deadliest terrorist attack on british soil 269 : on september 1 , 1983 , a soviet interceptor sukhoi su-15 shot down korean air lines flight 007 , a boeing 747 , bound for gimpo international airport in seoul , south korea , after it flew into soviet airspace ;

the minority report suggests an explosion was the likely cause 239 : on march 8 , 2014 , a boeing 777-200er , malaysia airlines flight 370 , flying from kuala lumpur , malaysia , to beijing , china , lost contact with air traffic controllers over the south china sea , deviated from its planned route , and was presumed lost in the southern indian ocean 234 : on september 26 , 1997 , an airbus a300b4-220 , garuda indonesia flight 152 , which departed from jakarta , indonesia , and was preparing to land at medan , north sumatra , crashed into mountainous terrain , killing 222 passengers and 12 crew members 229 : on september 2 , 1998 , a mcdonnell douglas md-11 , swissair flight 111 , carrying 215 passengers and 14 crew from new york city to geneva , switzerland crashed into the atlantic ocean near halifax , nova scotia , canada , killing all aboard after a lengthy investigation , an official report stated that flammable material used in the aircraft 's structure , specifically the personal tv systems recently installed in the business class cabin , allowed a fire to spread , resulting in a loss of control 228 : on june 1 , 2009 , an airbus a330-203 , air france flight 447 , carrying 216 passengers and 12 crew , was en route from rio de janeiro , brazil to paris , france , when it crashed into the atlantic ocean 228 : on august 6 , 1997 , a boeing 747-3b5 , korean air flight 801 , crashed on approach to the international airport in the united states territory of guam , killing 228 of the 254 people aboard contributing factors in the crash were fatigue and errors by the flight crew , inadequate flight crew training , and a modification of the airport 's altitude warning system that prevented it from detecting aircraft below a minimum safe altitude 227 : on january 8 , 1996 , an antonov an-32b aircraft with 6 crew members on board overshot the runway at n'dolo airport , kinshasa , democratic republic of congo , and plowed into a market place it was determined that the crash , which killed all 206 passengers and 19 crewmembers aboard the plane , was caused by improper repairs to the aircraft 22 years earlier when the aircraft encountered a tailstrike a branch of the islamic state of iraq and the levant claimed responsibility for bringing down the jet , and a russian investigation concluded that a bomb was detonated inside the plane at a high altitude 223 : on may 26 , 1991 , a boeing 767-3z9er , lauda air flight 004 , broke up in midair over a remote area of thailand due to an uncommanded deployment of a thrust reverser on one of the plane 's engines , killing all 213 passengers and 10 crewmembers aboard the flight , which originated at kai tak airport , hong kong , and made a stopover at don mueang international airport in bangkok , thailand , was en route to vienna international airport , vienna , austria , when the accident occurred 217 : on october 31 , 1999 , a boeing 767-366er , egyptair flight 990 , flying from los angeles international airport , united states , to cairo international airport , egypt , with a stop at john f the national transportation safety board determined that the probable cause of the crash was deliberate action by the relief first officer in response to his removal from international service within egyptair , a finding disputed by egyptian authorities who maintain another cause of the accident 213 : on january 1 , 1978 , a boeing 747-237b , air india flight 855 , crashed into the arabian sea just off the coast of bombay , india , killing all 190 passengers and 23 crew on board 203 : on february 16 , 1998 , an airbus a300b4-622r , china airlines flight 676 , en route from ngurah rai airport in bali , indonesia , to chiang kai-shek international airport ( now taoyuan international airport ) , taiwan , crashed into a road and residential neighborhood in taoyuan , taiwan , killing 182 passengers , 14 crew , and 7 people on the ground an investigation determined that when the control tower ordered the pilot to abort his landing and '' go around '' for a second attempt , the pilot , who had unintentionally released the plane 's autopilot , did nothing to take control of the plane for 11 seconds as he apparently thought the autopilot would initiate the go around '' 200 : on july 10 , 1985 , a tupolev tu-154b-2 , aeroflot flight 7425 , on a domestic karshi–ufa–leningrad route , crashed near uchkuduk , uzbek ssr , soviet union , on the first leg of its route both of these manufacturers place a huge emphasis on the use of aviation safety equipment , now a billion-dollar industry in its own right ; safety is a key selling point for these companies , as they recognize that a poor safety record in the aviation industry is a threat to corporate survival some major safety devices now required in commercial aircraft are : evacuation slides , to aid rapid passenger exit from an aircraft in an emergency situation advanced avionics , incorporating computerized auto-recovery and alert systems turbine engines with improved durability and failure containment mechanisms landing gear that can be lowered even after loss of power and hydraulics measured on a passenger-distance calculation , air travel is the safest form of transportation available : figures mentioned are the ones shared by the air industry when quoting air safety statistics when compared to all other modes of transport , on a 'fatality per mile basis ' , air transport is the safest & nbsp ; — six times safer than traveling by car ; twice as safe as rail in an effort to prevent incidents such as the disappearance of malaysia airlines flight mh370 , a new standard has been issued requiring all commercial aircraft to report their position every 15 & nbsp ; minutes to air traffic controllers regardless of the country of origin the standard is part of a long-term plan , called the global aeronautical distress and safety system ( gadss ) , which will require new aircraft to be equipped with data broadcast systems that are in constant contact with air traffic controllers the bureau of aircraft accidents archives ( b3a ) , a non-government organization based in geneva , compiles statistics on aviation accidents of aircraft capable of carrying more than six passengers , excluding helicopters , balloons , and combat aircraft
