aiws can be caused by abnormal amounts of electrical activity resulting in abnormal blood flow in the parts of the brain that process visual perception and texture individuals with aiws can experience hallucinations or illusions of expansion , reduction or distortion of their own body image , such as microsomatognosia ( feeling that their own body or body parts are shrinking ) , or macrosomatognosia ( feeling that their body or body parts are growing taller or larger ) symptoms of aiws do not appear to change in severity over the course of the syndrome , and though the symptoms may acutely impact the patient 's life while they are present , alice in wonderland syndrome typically resolves itself within weeks or months however , as there are no established diagnostic criteria for alice in wonderland syndrome , there is likely to be a large degree of variability in the diagnostic process and thus it can be poorly diagnosed it can also be the initial symptom of the epsteinâ€“barr virus ( see mononucleosis ) , and a relationship between the syndrome and mononucleosis has been suggested one hypothesis is that any condition resulting in a decrease in perfusion of the visual system or visual control centers of the brain may be responsible for the syndrome throughout all the neuroimaging studies , several cortical regions ( including the temporoparietal junction within the parietal lobe , and the visual pathway , specifically the occipital lobe ) are associated with the development of alice in wonderland syndrome symptoms micropsia is an abnormal visual condition , usually occurring in the context of visual hallucination , in which the affected person sees objects as being smaller than they are in reality for example , visual distortions may be a result of transient , localized ischemia ( an inadequate blood supply to an organ or part of the body ) in areas of the visual pathway during migraine attacks nuclear medical techniques using technetium , performed on patients during episodes of alice in wonderland syndrome , have demonstrated that aiws is associated with reduced cerebral perfusion in various cortical regions ( frontal , parietal , temporal and occipital ) , both in combination and in isolation the average age of the start of alice in wonderland syndrome is six years old , but it is very normal for some patients to experience the syndrome from childhood up to their late 20s as a consequence , the person can become alarmed , frightened , and panic-stricken throughout the course of the hallucinations , and affected people may even hurt themselves or others around them as a result of this alarm one study on 3,224 adolescents in japan demonstrated the occurrence of macropsia and micropsia to be 6.5 % in boys and 7.3 % in girls , suggesting that the symptoms of aiws may not be particularly rare additionally , aiws can be presumed if the patient presents symptoms along with migraines and complains of onset during the day ( although it can also occur at night ) complete and partial forms of the alice in wonderland syndrome exist in a range of other disorders , including epilepsy , intoxicants , infectious states , fevers , and brain lesions aiws affects the sense of vision , sensation , touch , and hearing , as well as the perception of one 's own body image migraines , nausea , dizziness , and agitation are also commonly associated symptoms with alice in wonderland syndrome furthermore , the syndrome is commonly associated with migraines , as well as the use of psychoactive drugs a person affected by alice in wonderland syndrome may also lose a sense of time , a problem similar to the lack of spatial perspective brought on by visual distortion these changes in perception are collectively known as metamorphopsia , or lilliputian hallucinations , which refers to objects appearing either smaller or larger than reality
