a dna transcription unit encoding for a protein may contain both a coding sequence , which will be translated into the protein , and regulatory sequences , which direct and regulate the synthesis of that protein the regulatory sequence before ( '' upstream '' from ) the coding sequence is called the five prime untranslated region ( 5'utr ) ; the sequence after ( '' downstream '' from ) the coding sequence is called the three prime untranslated region ( 3'utr ) the non-template ( sense ) strand of dna is called the coding strand , because its sequence is the same as the newly created rna transcript ( except for the substitution of uracil for thymine ) transcription begins with the binding of rna polymerase , together with one or more transcription factor , to a specific dna sequence referred to as a '' promoter '' to form an rna polymerase-promoter '' closed complex '' rna polymerase , assisted by one or more general transcription factors , then unwinds approximately 14 base pairs of dna to form an rna polymerase-promoter '' open complex '' '' rna polymerase , assisted by one or more general transcription factors , then selects a transcription start site in the transcription bubble , binds to an initiating ntp and an extending ntp ( or a short rna primer and an extending ntp ) complementary to the transcription start site sequence , and catalyzes bond formation to yield an initial rna product rna polymerase core enzyme binds to the bacterial general transcription ( sigma ) factor to form rna polymerase holoenzyme and then binds to a promoter in eukaryotes , in rna polymerase ii-dependent transcription , there are six general transcription factors : tfiia , tfiib ( an ortholog of archaeal tfb ) , tfiid ( a multisubunit factor in which the key subunit , tbp , is an ortholog of archaeal tbp ) , tfiie ( an ortholog of archaeal tfe ) , tfiif , and tfiih '' transcription initiation is regulated by additional proteins , known as activators and repressors , and , in some cases , associated coactivators or coactivator , which modulate formation and function of the transcription initiation complex in eukaryotes , at an rna polymerase ii-dependent promoter , upon promoter clearance , tfiih phosphorylates serine 5 on the carboxy terminal domain of rna polymerase ii , leading to the recruitment of capping enzyme ( ce ) one strand of the dna , the template strand ( or noncoding strand ) , is used as a template for rna synthesis as transcription proceeds , rna polymerase traverses the template strand and uses base pairing complementarity with the dna template to create an rna copy ( which elongates during the traversal ) although rna polymerase traverses the template strand from 3 ' → 5 ' , the coding ( non-template ) strand and newly formed rna can also be used as reference points , so transcription can be described as occurring 5 ' → 3 ' this produces an rna molecule from 5 ' → 3 ' , an exact copy of the coding strand ( except that thymines are replaced with uracils , and the nucleotides are composed of a ribose ( 5-carbon ) sugar where dna has deoxyribose ( one fewer oxygen atom ) in its sugar-phosphate backbone ) mrna transcription can involve multiple rna polymerases on a single dna template and multiple rounds of transcription ( amplification of particular mrna ) , so many mrna molecules can be rapidly produced from a single copy of a gene in the '' rho-dependent '' type of termination , a protein factor called '' rho '' destabilizes the interaction between the template and the mrna , thus releasing the newly synthesized mrna from the elongation complex as shown in the image in the right it is evident that the ctd ( c terminal domain ) is a tail that changes its shape ; this tail will be used as a carrier of splicing , capping and polyadenylation , as shown in the image on the left an example of such an antibacterial is rifampicin , which inhibits bacterial transcription of dna into mrna by inhibiting dna-dependent rna polymerase by binding its beta-subunit , while 8-hydroxyquinoline is an antifungal transcription inhibitor rna synthesis by rna polymerase was established in vitro by several laboratories by 1965 ; however , the rna synthesized by these enzymes had properties that suggested the existence of an additional factor needed to terminate transcription correctly transcription can be measured and detected in a variety of ways : g-less cassette transcription assay : measures promoter strength run-off transcription assay : identifies transcription start sites ( tss ) nuclear run-on assay : measures the relative abundance of newly formed transcripts kas-seq : measures single-stranded dna generated by rna polymerases ; can work with 1,000 cells rnase protection assay and chip-chip of rnap : detect active transcription sites rt-pcr : measures the absolute abundance of total or nuclear rna levels , which may however differ from transcription rates dna microarrays : measures the relative abundance of the global total or nuclear rna levels ; however , these may differ from transcription rates in situ hybridization : detects the presence of a transcript ms2 tagging : by incorporating rna stem-loop , such as ms2 , into a gene , these become incorporated into newly synthesized rna northern blot : the traditional method , and until the advent of rna-seq , the most quantitative rna-seq : applies next-generation sequencing techniques to sequence whole transcriptomes , which allows the measurement of relative abundance of rna , as well as the detection of additional variations such as fusion genes , post-transcriptional edits and novel splice sites single cell rna-seq : amplifies and reads partial transcriptomes from isolated cells , allowing for detailed analyses of rna in tissues , embryos , and cancers
