these two theories were active contenders until the 1965 discovery , by arno penzias and robert wilson , of the cosmic microwave background radiation , a fact that is a straightforward prediction of the big bang theory , and one that the original steady state theory could not account for when einstein found that his general relativity equations could easily be solved in such a way as to allow the universe to be expanding at the present and contracting in the far future , he added to those equations what he called a cosmological constant ⁠— ⁠essentially a constant energy density , unaffected by any expansion or contraction ⁠— ⁠whose role was to offset the effect of gravity on the universe as a whole in such a way that the universe would remain static an important parameter in fate of the universe theory is the density parameter , omega ( \omega ) , defined as the average matter density of the universe divided by a critical value of that density these three adjectives refer to the overall shape of the universe , and not to the local curving of spacetime caused by smaller clumps of mass ( for example , galaxies and stars ) if the primary content of the universe is inert matter , as in the dust models popular for much of the 20th century , there is a particular fate corresponding to each geometry the current scientific consensus of most cosmologists is that the ultimate fate of the universe depends on its overall shape , how much dark energy it contains and on the equation of state which determines how the dark energy density responds to the expansion of the universe recent observations conclude , from 7.5 billion years after the big bang , that the expansion rate of the universe has likely been increasing , commensurate with the open universe theory in a closed universe , gravity eventually stops the expansion of the universe , after which it starts to contract until all matter in the universe collapses to a point , a final singularity termed the '' big crunch '' , the opposite of the big bang the ultimate fate of an open universe is either universal heat death , a '' big freeze '' ( not to be confused with heat death , despite seemingly similar name interpretation ⁠— ⁠see theories about the end of the universe below ) , or a '' big rip '' , where the acceleration caused by dark energy eventually becomes so strong that it completely overwhelms the effects of the gravity , electromagnetic and strong binding forces if the average density of the universe exactly equals the critical density so that \omega 1 , then the geometry of the universe is flat : as in euclidean geometry , the sum of the angles of a triangle is 180 degrees and parallel lines continuously maintain the same distance in the absence of dark energy , a flat universe expands forever but at a continually decelerating rate , with expansion asymptotically approaching zero ; with dark energy , the expansion rate of the universe initially slows down , due to the effects of gravity , but eventually increases , and the ultimate fate of the universe becomes the same as that of an open universe the preponderance of evidence to date , based on measurements of the rate of expansion and the mass density , favors a universe that will continue to expand indefinitely , resulting in the '' big freeze '' scenario below a steady increase in the hubble constant to infinity would result in all material objects in the universe , starting with galaxies and eventually ( in a finite time ) all forms , no matter how small , disintegrating into unbound elementary particles , radiation and beyond just as the big bang started as a cosmological expansion , this theory assumes that the average density of the universe will be enough to stop its expansion and the universe will begin contracting the end result is unknown ; a simple estimation would have all the matter and space-time in the universe collapse into a dimensionless singularity back into how the universe started with the big bang , but at these scales unknown quantum effects need to be considered ( see quantum gravity ) the universe could then consist of an infinite sequence of finite universes , with each finite universe ending with a big crunch that is also the big bang of the next universe also , if the universe is closed , this theory would predict that once this universe collapses it will spawn another universe in an event similar to the big bang after a universal singularity is reached or a repulsive quantum force causes re-expansion this has the potential to fundamentally alter our universe ; in more audacious scenarios even the various physical constants could have different values , severely affecting the foundations of matter , energy , and spacetime if the theory of inflation is true , the universe went through an episode dominated by a different form of dark energy in the first moments of the big bang ; but inflation ended , indicating an equation of state far more complex than those assumed so far for present-day dark energy choosing among these rival scenarios is done by 'weighing ' the universe , for example , measuring the relative contributions of matter , radiation , dark matter , and dark energy to the critical density
