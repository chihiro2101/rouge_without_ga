the romans failed to defeat him in the field and he remained in italy , but following scipio 's decisive victory at the battle of ilipa in spain in 206 & nbsp ; bc , iberia had been secured by the romans he was later authorized to employ the regular forces stationed in sicily , which consisted mainly of the remnants of the 5th and 6th legion , exiled to the island as a punishment for the humiliation they suffered at the battle of cannae he landed at utica and defeated the carthaginian army at the battle of the great plains in 203 & nbsp ; bc the panicked carthaginians felt that they had no alternative but to offer peace to scipio , and having the authority to do so , scipio granted peace on generous terms the carthaginian senate recalled hannibal , who was still in italy ( although confined to the south of the peninsula ) when scipio landed in africa , in 203 & nbsp ; bc hannibal 's army consisted of 36,000 infantry , 4,000 cavalry and 80 war elephants , while scipio had a total of 29,000 infantry and 6,100 cavalry putting his cavalry on the flanks , with the inexperienced carthaginian cavalry on the right and the numidians on the left , hannibal aligned the rest of his troops in three straight lines behind his elephants in his second line he placed the carthaginian and libyan citizen levies , while his veterans from italy , including mercenaries from gaul and hispania , were placed in the third line hannibal intentionally held back his third infantry line , in order to thwart scipio 's tendency to pin the carthaginian center and envelop his opponent 's lines , as he had done at the battle of ilipa the plan was that when the elephants charged , these lanes would open , allowing them to pass through the legionaries ' ranks and be dealt with at the rear of the army hannibal and the carthaginians had relied on cavalry superiority in previous battles such as cannae , but scipio , recognizing their importance , held the cavalry advantage at zama at the outset of the battle , hannibal unleashed his elephants and skirmishers against the roman army in order to break the cohesion of their lines and exploit the breaches that could be opened seizing this opportunity , masinissa led his numidian cavalry and charged at the carthaginian left wing , which was also composed of numidian cavalry , and was unknowingly lured off the field meanwhile , the rest of the elephants were carefully lured through the lanes and funneled to the rear of the roman army , where they were dealt with the carthaginian cavalry , acting on the instructions of hannibal , allowed the roman cavalry to chase them in order to lure them away from the battlefield so that they would n't attack the carthaginian armies in the rear scipio played for time as he redeployed his forces in a single line with the hastati in the middle , the principes in the inner wings and the triarii on the outer wings the battle finally turned in the romans ' favor when the roman cavalry returned to the battlefield and attacked the carthaginian line from behind unlike the treaty that ended the first punic war , the terms carthage acceded to were so punishing that it was never able to challenge rome for supremacy of the mediterranean again this allowed the romans to establish a casus belli for the third punic war about 50 years later , after the carthaginians defended themselves from numidian encroachments , against which the romans did not initially intervene unable to field a viable force in open combat and abandoned by all of their punic allies , the carthaginians commenced a spirited defense of their home city which , after an extended siege , was captured and completely destroyed in 146 & nbsp ; bc
