the exact length of the affair between keeler and profumo is disputed , ending either in august 1961 once profumo was warned by the security services of the possible dangers of mixing with the ward circle , or continuing with decreasing fervour until december 1961 the photo shoot , at a studio on the first floor of peter cook 's establishment club , with morley was to promote a proposed film , the keeler affair , that was never released in the united kingdom on the weekend of 8–9 july 1961 , ward introduced keeler to john profumo , the secretary of state for war , at a pool party at cliveden , the buckinghamshire mansion owned by the 3rd viscount astor in her autobiography , secrets and lies , keeler maintains that ward was working as a double agent , having contact with both senior members of mi5 , and the kgb to whom he was passing uk state secrets in december 1963 , keeler pleaded guilty to charges of perjury before sir anthony hawke , the recorder of london , and she was sentenced to nine months ' imprisonment , serving four and a half months in prison she published several accounts of her life , in one of which she claimed that she became pregnant as a result of her relationship with profumo and subsequently had an abortion when i started painting , i decided to do a series of paintings of her , and as i researched christine 's life story , it struck me that , even though she is a culturally significant figure in british history , there is very little recent artistic reference to her ward 's trial , which ran 22–31 july 1963 , has been characterised as '' an act of political revenge '' for the embarrassment caused to the government after a hostile summing-up from the trial judge , ward was convicted , but before the jury returned their verdict , he took an overdose of barbiturates and died before sentence could be passed these events , in the summer of 1963 , brought keeler notoriety ; the economist gave the headline '' the prime minister 's crisis '' alongside a picture of keeler , with no further explanation in 1988 keeler was featured in bryan ferry 's promotional video for the single '' kiss and tell '' ( originally released on ferry 's seventh solo album , bête noire , in 1987 ) with mandy rice-davies ; this was meant to draw more attention to the song 's theme when keeler ended the relationship with edgecombe in december 1962 , edgecombe turned up at ward 's house in wimpole mews on 14 december , where she was temporarily seeking refuge , and fired five shots at the building '' the exhibition catalogue ( dear christine , april 2019 , edited by wilson , designed by rebecca fairman , includes writing by amanda coe ( screenwriter and executive producer of the trial of christine keeler ) , keeler 's son seymour platt , art historian kalliopi minioudaki , and artist and art critic bo gorzelak pedersen at his trial , which began on 5 june , he maintained that his innocence would be established by two witnesses who , the police told the court , could not be found he was accused of living off immoral earnings earned through keeler and mandy rice-davies , on the basis of the small contributions to household expenses or loan repayments the two had made to ward while living with him
