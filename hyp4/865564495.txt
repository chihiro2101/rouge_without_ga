frame formats that are supported by various satellite modems include : intelsat business service ( ibs ) framing intermediate data rate ( idr ) framing mpeg-2 transport framing ( used in dvb ) e1 and t1 framing high-end modems also incorporate some additional features : multiple data interfaces ( like rs-232 , rs-422 , v.35 , g.703 , lvds , ethernet ) ; embedded distant-end monitor and control ( edmac ) , allowing to control the distant-end modem ; automatic uplink power control ( aupc ) , that is , adjusting the output power to maintain a constant signal to noise ratio at the remote end ; drop and insert feature for a multiplexed stream , allowing to replace some channels in it similarly , a signal received from a satellite is firstly downconverter ( this is done by a low-noise block converter - lnb ) , then demodulated by a modem , and at last handled by data terminal equipment there are several modulation types ( such as psk and qam ) that have a phase ambiguity , that is , a carrier can be restored in different ways there are two different types , both employing the digital video broadcasting ( dvb ) standard as their basis : one-way satmodems ( dvb-ip modems ) use a return channel not based on communication with the satellite , such as telephone or cable data to be transmitted are transferred to a modem from data terminal equipment ( e.g satellite modem does n't have so many outputs , so a demultiplexer here performs a drop operation , allowing to choose channels that will be transferred to output error correction techniques are essential for satellite communications , because , due to satellite 's limited power a signal to noise ratio at the receiver is usually rather poor error correction works by adding an artificial redundancy to a data stream at the transmitting side , and using this redundancy to correct errors caused by noise and interference the modem usually has intermediate frequency ( if ) output ( that is , 50-200 & nbsp ; mhz ) , however , sometimes the signal is modulated directly to l-band scrambling is a technique used to randomize a data stream to eliminate long ' 0'-only and ' 1'-only sequences and to assure energy dispersal there are modulation types ( like frequency shift keying ) that can be demodulated without carrier recovery ( noncoherent demodulation ) but this method is generally worse the input signal for the analog tract is at the intermediate frequency or in the l-band , in the second case it must be firstly converted to if
