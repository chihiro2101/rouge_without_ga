ehrlich and holdren argued that all three factors were important but emphasized the role of human population growth , focusing on a broader scale , being less specific in space and time —— the equation can aid in understanding some of the factors affecting human impacts on the environment , but it has also been cited as a basis for many of the dire environmental predictions of the 1970s by paul ehrlich , george wald , denis hayes , lester brown , rené dubos , and sidney ripley that did not come to pass r bailey ( 2000 ) earth day then and now , reason 32 ( 1 ) , 18-28 neal koblitz classified equations of this type as '' mathematical propaganda '' and criticized ehrlich 's use of them in the media ( e.g as long as '' i '' is less than the carrying capacity the associated population , affluence , and technology that make up '' i '' can be perpetually endured in the i pat equation , the variable p represents the population of an area , such as the world although the un projects that human population may stabilize at around 11.2 billion in 2100 , the i pat equation will continue to be relevant for the increasing human impact on the environment in the short to mid-term future the t variable in the i pat equation represents how resource intensive the production of affluence is ; how much environmental impact is involved in creating , transporting and disposing of the goods , services and amenities used since technology can affect environmental impact in many different ways , the unit for t is often tailored for the situation to which i pat is being applied for example , for a situation where the human impact on climate change is being measured , an appropriate unit for t might be greenhouse gas emissions per unit of gdp criticisms of the i pat formula : too simplistic for complex problem interdependencies between variables general sweeping assumptions of variables ’ effect toward environmental impact cultural differences cause wide variation in impact technology can not properly be expressed in a unit the i pat equation has been criticized for being too simplistic by assuming that p , a , and t are independent of each other in reality , at least seven interdependencies between p , a , and t could exist , indicating that it is more correct to rewrite the equation as i f ( p , a , t ) for example , a doubling of technological efficiency , or equivalently a reduction of the t-factor by 50 % , does not necessarily reduce the environmental impact ( i ) by 50 % if efficiency induced price reductions stimulate additional consumption of the resource that was supposed to be conserved , a phenomenon called the rebound effect ( conservation ) or jevons paradox technofix : why technology wo n't save us or the environment , chapter 5 , '' in search of solutions ii : efficiency improvements '' , new society publishers , gabriola island , british columbia , canada , , 464 pp that all types of societies are subject to i pat was actually made clear in ehrlich and holdren 's 1972 dialogue with commoner in the bulletin of the atomic scientists , where they examine the pre-industrial ( and indeed prehistoric ) impact of human beings on the environment as a result of the interdependencies between p , a , and t and potential rebound effects , policies aimed at decreasing environmental impacts through reductions in p , a , and t may not only be very difficult to implement ( e.g
