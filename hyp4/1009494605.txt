instant-runoff voting is used in whole or in part to elect the leaders of the three largest federal political parties in canada : the liberal party of canada , the conservative party of canada , and the new democratic party , albeit the new democratic party uses a mixture of irv and exhaustive voting , allowing each member to choose one format or the other for their vote ( as was used in their 2017 leadership election ) however , voting for candidates will take place via the internet within three months , and , according to the spokesman of the party , the results of the primaries will not be mandatory for the nomination of the candidate and the party convention may nominate another candidate who does not even participate in the primaries , or even not nominate candidates and support president vladimir putin , if he decides to be re-elected the selection of candidates for federal , state , and local general elections takes place in primary elections organized by the public administration for the general voting public to participate in for the purpose of nominating the respective parties ' official candidates ; state voters start the electoral process for governors and legislators through the primary process , as well as for many local officials from city councilors to county commissioners only three parties organised an open primary : france ( ps ) , greece ( πασοκ ) , italy ( pd ) closed primary happened in nine parties : belgium ( sp.a , ps ) , cyprus ( εδεκ ) , denmark ( sd ) , france ( ps ) until 2011 , ireland ( lp ) , netherlands ( pvda ) , portugal ( ps ) , spain ( psoe ) , united kingdom ( labour ) the case of uk 's labour party leadership election is specific , as three electoral colleges , each accounting for one third of the votes , participate in this primary election : labour members of parliament and of the european parliament , party members and members of affiliated organisations such as trade unions when a qualifying primary is applied to a partisan election , it becomes what is generally known as a blanket or louisiana primary : typically , if no candidate wins a majority in the primary , the two candidates receiving the highest pluralities , regardless of party affiliation , go on to a general election that is in effect a run-off among the changes : the primary election cycle would start nearly a year earlier than in previous cycles , states from the west and the south would be included in the earlier part of the schedule , and candidates who run in primary elections not held in accordance with the dnc 's proposed schedule ( as the dnc does not have any direct control over each state 's official election schedules ) would be penalized by being stripped of delegates won in offending states the united states is one of a handful of countries to select candidates through popular vote in a primary election system ; most other countries rely on party leaders or paid up party members to select candidates , as was previously the case in the u.s all citizens on the electoral rolls , members of the socialist party and the radical party of the left , and members of the parties ' youth organisation ( mjs and jrg ) , including minors of 15 to 18 years old , were entitled to vote in exchange for one euro to cover the costs the more open the system , the greater the chance of raiding , or voters voting in the other party 's primary in hopes of getting a weaker opponent chosen to run against a strong candidate in the general election a criticism of the current presidential primary election schedule is that it gives undue weight to the few states with early primaries , as those states often build momentum for leading candidates and rule out trailing candidates long before the rest of the country has even had a chance to weigh in , leaving the last states with virtually no actual input on the process if the party wins the second-most seats , the party leader will become leader of the official opposition ; if the party comes third or lower , the leader will still be recognized as the leader of their party , and will be responsible for co-ordinating the activities and affairs of their party 's caucus in the legislature '' no presidential primary , caucus , convention , or other meeting may be held for the purpose of voting for a presidential candidate and/or selecting delegates or alternate delegates to the national convention , prior to the first tuesday of february in the year in which the national convention is held indeed , the lisbon treaty , which entered into force in december 2009 , lays down that the outcome of elections to the european parliament must be taken into account in selecting the president of the commission ; the commission is in some respects the executive branch of the eu and so its president can be regarded as the eu prime minister president and county central committee offices , all candidates running in a primary election regardless of party will appear on a single primary election ballot and voters may vote for any candidate , with the top two vote-getters overall moving on to the general election regardless of party the counterargument to this criticism , however , is that , by subjecting candidates to the scrutiny of a few early states , the parties can weed out candidates who are unfit for office a campaign for a pes primary website of the campaign for a pes primary was then launched by pes supporters in june 2010 , and it managed to convince the pes council meeting in warsaw in december 2010 to set up working group '' candidate 2014 '' in charge of proposing a procedure and timetable for a '' democratic '' and '' transparent '' designation process '' bringing on board all our parties and all levels within the parties '' typically , in the months before an anticipated general election , local riding associations of political parties in each electoral district will schedule and announce a nomination meeting ( similar to a nominating caucus in the united states ) however , the primaries , as well as earlier , were not binding for the leadership of united russia : a number of winners of the primaries were withdrawn by the leadership without any explanation of reasons , and in 18 single-seat constituencies the party did not nominate any candidates united states democratic party ( 2020 ) republican party ( 2020 ) costa rica : the country 's three main political parties , the national liberation party , the social christian unity party , and the citizens ' action party , have all run primary elections on several different occasions in order to tame potential feud in his party , and prepare the ground for a long campaign , sarkozy pushed for a closed primary in 2006 to designate the ump candidate for the 2008 election of the mayor of paris if no candidate receives a majority , twice as many candidates pass the primary as can win in the general election , so a single seat election primary would allow the top two primary candidates to participate in the general election following in 2016 , the primaries for the selection of candidates for parliamentary elections were held by four parties : united russia , people 's freedom party , предварительное голосование « волна перемен » парнас the party of growth and the green alliance because many washington residents were disappointed over the loss of their blanket primary , which the washington state grange helped institute in 1935 , the grange filed initiative 872 in 2004 to establish a blanket primary for partisan races , thereby allowing voters to once again cross party lines in the primary election it was to be open to all citizens of the eu over the age of 16 who '' supported green values '' they elected two transnational candidates who were to be the face of the common campaign of the european green parties united in the egp , and who also were their candidates for european commission president leadership election , a similar process in countries with a parliamentary system sore-loser law , which states that the loser in a primary election can not thereafter run as an independent in the general election ; people thomas w the conservative party used irv ( where each of the party 's 338 riding associations are weighted voting , regardless of how many members voted in each riding ) to elect erin o'toole as party leader in 2020 , andrew scheer in 2017 , and stephen harper in 2004 in a closed system , from the time a candidate qualifies to the day of the primary , he tends to have to cater to partisans , who tend to lean to the more extreme ends of the ideological spectrum closed primaries happen in many european countries , while open primaries have so far only occurred in the socialist and social-democratic parties in greece and italy , whereas the france 's socialist party organised the first open primary in france in october 2011 to avoid swamping by the parties from the big countries , one could divide the number of votes cast for each candidate in each country by that country 's voting weight in the council of ministers two years later , on 14 october 2007 , voters of the democratic party were called to choose the party leader among a list of six , their representatives to the constituent assembly and the local leaders the theory is that opposing party members vote for the weakest candidate of the opposite party in order to give their own party the advantage in the general election fifteen statesalaska , arizona , california , colorado , illinois , iowa , kansas , new hampshire , new jersey , north carolina , ohio , oregon , rhode island , utah , and west virginiahave semi-closed primaries that allow voters to register or change party preference on election day argentina 2019 argentine general election chile 2017 chilean presidential primaries colombia : in the 2006 presidential elections , the liberal party , and the socialist alternative democratic pole held primary elections , electing horacio serpa as the liberal candidate , and carlos gaviria as candidate of the alternative democratic pole in the united states , iowa and new hampshire have drawn attention every four years because they hold the first caucus and primary election , respectively , and often give a candidate the momentum to win their party 's nomination resolution of the pes council in warsaw , a democratic and transparent process for designating the pes candidate for the european commission presidency , 2 december 2010 the european think-tank notre europe also evokes the idea that european political parties should designate their candidate for vice-president/high representative of the union for foreign affairs in 2011 , the socialist party decided to organise the first ever open primary in france to pick the socialist party and the radical party of the left nominee for the 2012 presidential election primaries can be used in nonpartisan elections to reduce the set of candidates that go on to the general election ( qualifying primary ) when voters do not register with a party before the primary , it is called a pick-a-party primary because the voter can select which party 's primary they wish to vote in on election day while it is clear that the closed/semi-closed/semi-open/open classification commonly used by scholars studying primary systems does not fully explain the highly nuanced differences seen from state to state , still , it is very useful and has real-world implications for the electorate , election officials , and the candidates themselves a primary in which the ballot is not restricted to candidates from one party , where the top two candidates advance to the general election regardless of party affiliation later in 2002 , although the candidacy of then-pm jospin was undisputed in his party , each of the five left-wing parties of the government he led sent a candidate , paving the way for all five to lose by the spoiler effect both primaries and caucuses are used in the presidential nomination process , beginning in january or february and culminating in the late summer political party conventions in the 2010 presidential elections , four parties held primary elections : the liberal party elected former minister rafael pardo as candidate , the democratic pole elected senator gustavo petro , the conservative party chose ambassador noemi sanin , and the green party chose former mayor of bogota antanas mockus ( synonyms : internal primaries , party primaries ) in the case of closed primaries , internal primaries , or party primaries , only party members can vote after the nomination meeting , the candidate and the association will obtain approval from party headquarters , and file the candidate 's official nomination papers and necessary fees and deposits with elections canada or the provincial/territorial election commissions as appropriate as in europe , nomination meetings and leadership elections ( somewhat similar to primary elections ) in canada are not organized by the public administration but by parties themselves already in april 2004 , a former british conservative mep , tom spencer , advocated for american-style primaries in the european people 's party : '' a series of primary elections would be held at two-week intervals in february and march 2009 not only will the party leader run for a seat in their own chosen riding , they will also become prime minister ( in a federal election ) or premier ( in a province or territory ) should their party win the most seats parties are therefore encouraged to designate their candidates for commission president ahead of the next election in 2014 , in order to allow voters to vote with a full knowledge of the
