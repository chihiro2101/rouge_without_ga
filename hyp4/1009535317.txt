for legal purposes , deceit is a tort that occurs when a person makes a factual misrepresentation , knowing that it is false ( or having no belief in its truth and being reckless as to whether it is true ) and intending it to be relied on by the recipient , and the recipient acts to his or her detriment in reliance on it deceit may also be grounds for legal action in contract law ( known as misrepresentation , or if deliberate , fraudulent misrepresentation ) , or a criminal prosecution , on the basis of fraud lastly , it has also been suggested that an unpleasant treatment used in a deception study or the unpleasant implications of the outcome of a deception study may be the underlying reason that a study using deception is perceived as unethical in nature , rather than the actual deception itself ( broder , 1998 , p they also note that , in some cases , using deception is the only way to obtain certain kinds of information , and that prohibiting all deception in research would '' have the egregious consequence of preventing researchers from carrying out a wide range of important studies '' ( kimmel , 1998 , p streeter , krauss , geller , olson , and apple ( 1977 ) have assessed that fear and anger , two emotions widely associated with deception , cause greater arousal than grief or indifference , and note that the amount of stress one feels is directly related to the frequency of the voice for example , if a psychologist is interested in learning the conditions under which students cheat on tests , directly asking them , '' how often do you cheat ? , '' might result in a high percent of '' socially desirable '' answers and the researcher would , in any case , be unable to verify the accuracy of these responses in general , discovery of deception can result in a decrease in relationship satisfaction and commitment level , however , in instances where a person is successfully deceived , relationship satisfaction can actually be positively impacted for the person deceived , since lies are typically used to make the other partner feel more positive about the relationship the rationale for such deception is that humans are sensitive to how they appear to others ( and to themselves ) and this self-consciousness might interfere with or distort from how they actually behave outside of a research context ( where they would not feel they were being scrutinized ) the interpersonal deception theory posits that interpersonal deception is a dynamic , iterative process of mutual influence between a sender , who manipulates information to depart from the truth , and a receiver , who attempts to establish the validity of the message there are three simulation techniques : mimicry ( copying another model or example , such as non-poisonous snakes which have the colours and markings of poisonous snakes ) , fabrication ( making up a new model ) , and distraction ( offering an alternative model ) the act of deception can also result in feelings of distress for the deceiver , which become worse the longer the deceiver has known the deceived , as well as in longer-term relationships those who do not object to the use of deception note that there is always a constant struggle in balancing '' the need for conducting research that may solve social problems and the necessity for preserving the dignity and rights of the research participant '' ( christensen , 1988 , p omitting relevance : not stating something that is helpful to know , for example , a car can be like new but it does not help if you leave out the part that there is a transmission issue in general , then , when it is unfeasible or naive to simply ask people directly why or how often they do what they do , researchers turn to the use of deception to distract their participants from the true behavior of interest men are generally speculated to cheat more than women , but it is unclear if this is a result of socialization processes where it is more acceptable for men to cheat compared to women or due to an actual increase in this behavior for men buller and burgoon ( 1996 ) have proposed three taxonomies to distinguish motivations for deception based on their interpersonal deception theory : instrumental : to avoid punishment or to protect resources relational : to maintain relationships or bonds identity : to preserve “ face ” or the self-image to make something that appears to be something that it is not , usually for the purpose of encouraging an adversary to reveal , endanger , or divert that adversary 's own resources ( i.e insecure attachment styles are characterized by a lack of comfort within a romantic relationship resulting in a desire to be overly independent ( avoidant attachment style ) or a desire to be overly dependent on their partner in an unhealthy way ( anxious attachment style ) those individuals that show a higher level of executive control can more easily influence/control their thoughts and behaviors in relation to potential threats to an ongoing relationship which can result in paying less attention to threats to the current relationship ( other potential romantic mates ) those with an insecure attachment style are characterized by not believing that their romantic partner can/will support and comfort them in an effective way , either stemming from a negative belief regarding themselves ( anxious attachment style ) or a negative belief regarding romantic others ( avoidant attachment style ) in general , deception tends to occur less often in relationships with higher satisfaction and commitment levels and in relationships where partners have known each other longer , such as long-term relationships and marriage the liars that experience guilt have been shown to make attempts at putting distance between themselves and the deceptive communication , producing “ nonimmediacy cues ” these can be verbal or physical , including speaking in more indirect ways and showing an inability to maintain eye contact with their conversation partners in fact , sunflower oil is relatively low in omega-3 fatty acids and is not particularly good for brain health , so while this claim is technically true , it leads the receiver to infer false information baumrind ( 1964 ) , criticizing the use of deception in the milgram experiment , argues that deception experiments inappropriately take advantage of the implicit trust and obedience given by the subject when the subject volunteers to participate ( p while it is difficult to deceive a partner over a long period of time , deception often occurs in day-to-day conversations between relational partners self-focused motives : using deception to enhance or protect one 's own self-image , maintain or establish their autonomy , avoid constrictions , unwanted activities , or impositions , shield themselves from anger , embarrassment , or criticism , or resolve an argument attachment style impacts the probability of infidelity and research indicates that people with an insecure attachment style ( anxious or avoidant ) are more likely to cheat compared to individuals with a secure attachment style , especially for avoidant men and anxious women in a more abstract sense , 'disguise ' may refer to the act of disguising the nature of a particular proposal in order to hide an unpopular motivation or effect associated with that proposal at the conclusion of this or any research involving deception , all participants must be told of the true nature of the study and why deception was necessary ( this is called debriefing ) partner-focused motives : using deception to avoid hurting the partner , to help the partner to enhance or maintain their self-esteem , to avoid worrying the partner , and to protect the partner 's relationship with a third party for example , in world war ii , it was common for the allies to use hollow tanks made out of wood to fool german reconnaissance planes into thinking a large armor unit was on the move in one area while the real tanks were well hidden and on the move in a location far from the fabricated '' dummy '' tanks for example , a claim that 'sunflower oil is beneficial to brain health due to the presence of omega-3 fatty acids ' may be misleading , as it leads the receiver to believe sunflower oil will benefit brain health more so than other foods in nature , the defensive mechanisms of most octopuses to eject black ink in a large cloud to aid in escape from predators is a form of camouflage however , because of its very nature , a researcher conducting a deception experiment can not reveal its true purpose to the subject , thereby making any consent given by a subject misinformed ( p
