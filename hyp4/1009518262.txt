at the end of world war i , piston engine power could be boosted by compressing intake air with a compressor , also compensating for decreasing air density with altitude , improved with 1930s turbochargers for the boeing b-17 the 1937 hindenburg disaster ended the era of passenger airships but the us navy used airships for anti-submarine warfare and airborne early warning into the 1960s , while small airships continue to be used for aerial advertising , sightseeing flights , surveillance and research , and the airlander 10 or the lockheed martin lmh-1 continue to be developed ( formerly finmeccnica ) account for a large share of the global aerospace industry and research effort , with the european space agency as one of the largest consumers of aerospace technology and products to board an airliner , jet bridges in the 1950s , to improve thrust and fuel efficiency , the jet engine airflow was divided into a core stream and a bypass stream with a lower velocity for better propulsive efficiency : the first was the rolls-royce conway with a 0.3 bpr on the boeing 707 in 1960 , followed by the pratt & whitney jt3d with a 1.5 bpr and , derived from the j79 , the general electric cj805 powered the convair 990 with a 28 % lower cruise fuel burn ; bypass ratio improved to the 9.3 bpr rolls-royce trent xwb , the 10:1 bpr ge9x and the pratt & whitney gtf with high-pressure ratio cores multiple technologies and innovations are used in aerospace , many of them pioneered around world war ii : patented by short brothers , to improve low-speed performance , a de havilland dh4 was modified by handley page to a monoplane with high-lift devices : full-span leading-edge slats and trailing-edge flaps ; in 1924 , fowler flaps that extend backward and downward were invented in the us , and used on the lockheed model 10 electra while in 1943 forward-hinged leading-edge krueger flaps were invented in germany and later used on the boeing 707 however , the uk has a very active aerospace sector , including the second largest defence contractor in the world , bae systems , supplying fully assembled aircraft , aircraft components , sub-assemblies and sub-systems to other manufacturers , both in europe and all over the world in india , bangalore is a major center of the aerospace industry , where hindustan aeronautics limited , the national aerospace laboratories and the indian space research organisation are headquartered the united kingdom formerly attempted to maintain its own large aerospace industry , making its own airliners and warplanes , but it has largely turned its lot over to cooperative efforts with continental companies , and it has turned into a large import customer , too , from countries such as the united states in the people 's republic of china , beijing , xi'an , chengdu , shanghai , shenyang and nanchang are major research and manufacture centers of the aerospace industry the 19th century saw the creation of the aeronautical society of great britain ( 1866 ) , the american rocketry society , and the institute of aeronautical sciences , all of which made aeronautics a more serious scientific discipline france has continued to make its own warplanes for its air force and navy , and sweden continues to make its own warplanes for the swedish air force & mdash ; especially in support of its position as a neutral country aerodynamics aeronautics aerospace engineering aircraft astronautics newspace space agencies ( list of ) space exploration spacecraft wiktionary : aviation , aerospace , and aeronautical terms in the united states , the department of defense and the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) are the two largest consumers of aerospace technology and products in january 1930 , royal air force pilot and engineer frank whittle filed a patent for a gas turbine aircraft engine with an inlet , compressor , combustor , turbine and nozzle , while an independent turbojet was developed by researcher hans von ohain in germany ; both engines ran within weeks in early 1937 and the heinkel hes 3-propelled heinkel he 178 experimental aircraft made its first flight on aug 27 , 1939 while the whittle w.1-powered gloster e.28/39 prototype flew on may 15 , 1941 in world war ii , the german v-2 combined gyroscopes , an accelerometer and a primitive computer for real-time inertial navigation allowing dead reckoning without reference to landmarks or guide stars , leading to packaged imus for spacecraft and aircraft in 1933 , plexiglas , a transparent acrylic plastic , was introduced in germany and shortly before world war ii , was first used for aircraft windshields as it is lighter than glass , and the bubble canopy improved fighter pilots visibility first flown in 1935 , the queen bee was a radio-controlled target drone derived from the tiger moth for flak training ; the ryan firebee was a jet-powered target drone developed into long-range reconnaissance uavs : the ryan model 147 fire fly and lightning bug ; the israeli iai scout and tadiran mastiff launched a line of battlefield uavs including the iai searcher ; developed from the general atomics gnat long-endurance uav for the cia , the mq-1 predator led to the armed mq-9 reaper for example , several states have a civilian space program funded by the government , such as nasa in the united states , european space agency in europe , the canadian space agency in canada , indian space research organisation in india , jaxa in japan , roscosmos in russia , china national space administration in china , suparco in pakistan , iranian space agency in iran , and korea aerospace research institute in south korea aerospace manufacturing is a high-technology industry that produces '' aircraft , guided missiles , space vehicles , aircraft engines , propulsion units , and related parts '' in 1935 , german aerodynamicist adolf busemann proposed using swept wings to reduce high-speed drag and the messerschmitt p.1101 fighter prototype was 80 % complete by the end of world war ii ; the later us north american f-86 and boeing b-47 flew in 1947 , as the soviet mig-15 , and the british de havilland comet in 1949 it was the preliminary work of cayley , lilienthal , chanute , and other early aerospace engineers that brought about the first powered sustained flight at kitty hawk , north carolina on december 17 , 1903 , by the wright brothers in the early 1940s , british hurricane and spitfire pilots wore g-suits to prevent g-loc due to blood pooling in the lower body in high g situations ; mayo clinic researchers developed air-filled bladders to replace water-filled bladders and in 1943 the us military began using pressure suits from the david clark company
