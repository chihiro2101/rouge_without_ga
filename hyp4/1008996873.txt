'' pleasure '' refers to experience that feels good , that involves the enjoyment of something but in its most general sense , it includes all types of positive or pleasant experiences including the enjoyment of sports , seeing a beautiful sunset or engaging in an intellectually satisfying activity pleasure contrasts with pain or suffering , which are forms of feeling bad the concept of pleasure is similar but not identical to the concepts of well-being and of happiness but there may be other things besides or instead of pleasure that constitute well-being , like health , virtue , knowledge or the fulfillment of desires pleasure may have a role to play in this attitude , but it is not identical to happiness freud 's pleasure principle ties pleasure to motivation and action by holding that there is a strong psychological tendency to seek pleasure and to avoid pain classical utilitarianism connects pleasure to ethics in stating that whether an action is right depends on the pleasure it produces : it should maximize the sum-total of pleasure many pleasurable experiences are associated with satisfying basic biological drives , such as eating , exercise , hygiene , sleep , and sex bentham listed 14 kinds of pleasure ; sense , wealth , skill , amity , a good name , power , piety , benevolence , malevolence , memory , imagination , expectation , pleasures dependent on association , and the pleasures of relief chapter v , an introduction to the principles of morals and legislation , bentham , 1789 , some commentators see 'complex pleasures ' including wit and sudden realisation , complex pleasure : forms of feeling in german literature , stanley corngold , stanford press , 1998 and some see a wide range of pleasurable feelings pleasure comes in various forms , for example , in the enjoyment of food , sex , sports , seeing a beautiful sunset or engaging in an intellectually satisfying activity quality theories hold that pleasure is a quality of pleasurable experiences themselves while attitude theories state that pleasure is in some sense external to the experience since it depends on the subject 's attitude to the experience but considering the pleasure of seeing a beautiful sunset , there seems to be no specific region in the body at which we experience this pleasure these problems can be avoided by felt-quality-theories , which see pleasure not as a sensation but as an aspect qualifying sensations or other mental phenomena it also captures the intuition that pleasure is usually pleasure of something : enjoyment of drinking a milkshake or of playing chess but not just pure or object-less enjoyment but this version faces a related problem akin to the euthyphro dilemma : it seems that we usually desire things because they are enjoyable , not the other way round utilitarianism , on the other hand , is a family of altruist theories that are more respectable in the philosophical community this position entails that things other than pleasure , like knowledge , virtue or money , only have instrumental value : they are valuable because or to the extent that they produce pleasure but lack value otherwise quantitative hedonists , following jeremy bentham , hold that the specific content or quality of a pleasure-experience is not relevant to its value , which only depends on its quantitative features : intensity and duration on this account , an experience of intense pleasure of indulging in food and sex is worth more than an experience of subtle pleasure of looking at fine art or of engaging in a stimulating intellectual conversation instead , they argue that the quality is another factor relevant to the value of a pleasure-experience , for example , that the lower pleasures of the body are less valuable than the higher pleasures of the mind that for an object to be beautiful is for it to cause pleasure or that the experience of beauty is always accompanied by pleasure we take pleasure from many things that are not beautiful , which is why beauty is usually defined in terms of a special type of pleasure : aesthetic or disinterested pleasure for example , the joy of looking at a beautiful landscape would still be valuable if it turned out that this experience was an illusion , which would not be true if this joy was due to seeing the landscape as a valuable real estate opportunity this problem is akin to the euthyphro dilemma : is something beautiful because we enjoy it or do we enjoy it because it is beautiful ? identity theorists solve this problem by denying that there is a difference between beauty and pleasure : they identify beauty , or the appearance of it , with the experience of aesthetic pleasure ) , but on beliefs about its history , about the circumstances of its creation , about its rarity , fame , or price , and on other non-intrinsic attributes , such as the social status or identity it conveys freud also described the pleasure principle as a positive feedback mechanism that motivates the organism to recreate the situation it has just found pleasurable , and to avoid past situations that caused pain it states that our overall impression of past events is determined for the most part not by the total pleasure and suffering it contained but by how it felt at its peaks and at its end for example , the memory of a painful colonoscopy is improved if the examination is extended by three minutes in which the scope is still inside but not moved anymore , resulting in a moderately uncomfortable sensation daniel kahneman explains this distortion in terms of the difference between two selves : the experiencing self , which is aware of pleasure and pain as they are happening , and the remembering self , which shows the aggregate pleasure and pain over an extended period of time this principle states that the temporal location of a benefit or a harm is not important for its normative significance : a rational agent should care to the same extend about all parts of her life based upon the incentive salience model of reward – the attractive and motivational property of a stimulus that induces approach behavior and consummatory behavior – an intrinsic reward has two components : a '' wanting '' or desire component that is reflected in approach behavior , and a '' liking '' or pleasure component that is reflected in consummatory behavior in the past , there has been debate as to whether pleasure is experienced by other animals rather than being an exclusive property of humankind ; however , it is now known that animals do experience pleasure , as measured by objective behavioral and neural hedonic responses to pleasurable stimuli
