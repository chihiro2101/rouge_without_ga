the heated filament , or cathode , was capable of thermionic emission of electrons that would flow to the plate ( or anode ) when it was at a higher voltage in the hague , the netherlands , pcgg started broadcasting on november 6 , 1919 , making it , arguably the first commercial broadcasting station in 1916 , frank conrad , an electrical engineer employed at the westinghouse electric ( 1886 ) , began broadcasting from his wilkinsburg , pennsylvania garage with the call letters 8xk the bbc was amalgamated in 1922 and received a royal charter in 1926 , making it the first national broadcaster in the world , followed by czech radio and other european broadcasters in 1923 curry college in milton , massachusetts introduced one of the first broadcasting majors in 1932 when the college teamed up with wloe in boston to have students broadcast programs a radio broadcasting station is usually associated with wireless transmission , though in practice broadcasting transmission ( sound and television ) take place using both wires and radio waves in line to itu radio regulations ( article1.61 ) each broadcasting station shall be classified by the service in which it operates permanently or temporarily there are several subtypes , namely commercial broadcasting , non-commercial educational ( nce ) public broadcasting and non-profit varieties as well as community radio , student-run campus radio stations , and hospital radio stations can be found throughout the world nielsen audio , formerly known as arbitron , the united states-based company that reports on radio audiences , defines a '' radio station '' as a government-licensed am or fm station ; an hd radio ( primary or multicast ) station ; an internet stream of an existing government-licensed station ; one of the satellite radio channels from xm satellite radio or sirius satellite radio ; or , potentially , a station that is not government licensed am refers to amplitude modulation , a mode of broadcasting radio waves by varying the amplitude of the carrier signal in response to the amplitude of the signal to be transmitted in response to the growing popularity of fm stereo radio stations in the late 1980s and early 1990s , some north american stations began broadcasting in am stereo , though this never gained popularity , and very few receivers were ever sold based on the '' interference '' entry of the concise oxford english dictionary , 11th edition , online one advantage of am radio signal is that it can be detected ( turned into sound ) with simple equipment if a signal is strong enough , not even a power source is needed ; building an unpowered crystal radio was a common childhood project in the early decades of am broadcasting am broadcasts occur on north american airwaves in the medium wave frequency range of 525 to 1705 khz ( known as the “ standard broadcast band ” ) in a crowded channel environment , this means that the power of regional channels which share a frequency must be reduced at night or directionally beamed in order to avoid interference , which reduces the potential nighttime audience am radio transmitters can transmit audio frequencies up to 15 & nbsp ; khz ( now limited to 10 & nbsp ; khz in the us due to fcc rules designed to reduce interference ) , but most receivers are only capable of reproducing frequencies up to 5 & nbsp ; khz or less image:2006fm broadcast stations.png thumb right 260px fm radio broadcast stations in 2006 fm refers to frequency modulation , and occurs on vhf airwaves in the frequency range of 88 to 108 mhz everywhere except japan and russia edwin howard armstrong invented fm radio to overcome the problem of electromagnetic interference ( rfi ) , which plagued am radio reception in other countries , greater spacing is sometimes mandatory , such as in new zealand , which uses 700 & nbsp ; khz spacing ( previously 800 & nbsp ; khz ) the improved fidelity made available was far in advance of the audio equipment of the 1940s , but wide interchannel spacing was chosen to take advantage of the noise-suppressing feature of wideband fm at the time fm was set up , the available frequencies were far higher in the spectrum than those used for am radio - by a factor of approximately 100 the change to the current frequencies , 88 to 108 & nbsp ; mhz , began after the end of world war ii and was to some extent imposed by am broadcasters as an attempt to cripple what was by now realized to be a potentially serious threat the more prosperous am stations , or their owners , acquired fm licenses and often broadcast the same programming on the fm station as on the am station ( '' simulcasting '' ) by the 1980s , since almost all new radios included both am and fm tuners , fm became the dominant medium , especially in cities rules and regulations vary largely from country to country , but often the term pirate radio generally describes the unlicensed broadcast of fm radio , am radio , or shortwave signals over a wide range in some places , radio stations are legal where the signal is transmitted , but illegal where the signals are received—especially when the signals cross a national boundary in other cases , a broadcast may be considered '' pirate '' due to the type of content , its transmission format , or the transmitting power ( wattage ) of the station , even if the transmission is not technically illegal ( such as a webcast or an amateur radio transmission ) digital radio broadcasting has emerged , first in europe ( the uk in 1995 and germany in 1999 ) , and later in the united states , france , the netherlands , south africa , and many other countries worldwide the simplest system is named dab digital radio , for digital audio broadcasting , and uses the public domain eureka 147 ( band iii ) system the broadcasting regulators of the united states and canada have chosen to use hd radio , an in-band on-channel system that puts digital broadcasts at frequencies adjacent to the analog broadcast an international non-profit consortium digital radio mondiale ( drm ) , has introduced the public domain drm system , which is used by a relatively small number of broadcasters worldwide for example , a program on radio moscow from the 1960s to the 1980s was what is communism ? a second reason is to advance a nation 's foreign policy interests and agenda by disseminating its views on international affairs or on the events in particular parts of the world currently , the us operates similar services aimed at cuba ( radio y televisión martí ) and the people 's republic of china , vietnam , laos and north korea ( radio free asia ) extensions of traditional radio-wave broadcasting for audio broadcasting in general include cable radio , local wire television networks , dtv radio , satellite radio , and internet radio via streaming media on the internet both xm and sirius are owned by sirius xm satellite radio , which was formed by the merger of xm and sirius on july 29 , 2008 , whereas in canada , xm radio canada and sirius canada remained separate companies until 2010 broadcasting construction permit call sign disc jockey ( dj ) history of broadcasting international broadcasting list of radio topics low power radio station radio radio antenna radio network radio personality rf modulation sports commentator television station something in the air : radio , rock , and the revolution that shaped a generation ( random house , 2007 ) points on the dial : golden age radio beyond the networks ( duke university press ;
