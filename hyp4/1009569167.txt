in 1933 , eighteen-year-old vernon rudolph , along with his brother lewis rudolph , began working for his uncle , ishmael armstrong , who owned a small general store in paducah , kentucky , that sold a wide variety of goods , including its very popular doughnuts while the exact origin of the doughnut recipe remains partially a mystery , it is believed that ishmael armstrong was inspired by an ohio river barge cook named joseph lebeouf who was famous for his light and fluffy doughnuts the uncle and nephew focused solely on selling their doughnuts and opened '' the krispy kreme doughnut company '' in a rented store on gallatin road in 1937 , rudolph opened his own store , deciding on winston-salem , north carolina for the location when he learned that his favorite cigarette company , camel cigarettes , was headquartered in the small north carolina city the first store in north carolina was located in a rented building on south main street in winston-salem in what is now called historic old salem by the 1960s , krispy kreme was known throughout the southeast , and it began to expand into other areas on may 17 , 2001 , krispy kreme switched to the new york stock exchange , with the ticker symbol kkd , which it carried until its private acquisition this explanation was viewed with skepticism by analysts , as '' blaming the atkins diet for disappointing earnings carried a whiff of desperation '' , and as rival donut chain , dunkin ' donuts has not suffered from the low-carb trend over the same compared period while this approach initially grew revenues and profits at the parent-company level , due to royalty payments from new franchisees , which also increased sales , this reduced the profitability of individual franchisees in the long run as they were forced to compete with one another all this expansion devalued krispy kreme brand 's novelty , by making the once-specialty donuts ubiquitous , particularly as the newer sales outlets required pre-made donuts as opposed to the ones made fresh in factory stores , which alienated brand devotees besides royalty payments from new stores , the parent company also enjoyed significant profits by requiring franchisees to purchase mix and doughnut-making equipment from the parent 's krispy kreme manufacturing and distribution ( kkm & d ) division on march 4 , 2009 , the sec issued a cease and desist order against krispy kreme for its actions inflating their revenues and engaging in illicit activities regarding the purchasing of its own stores to prop up revenues and setting up mechanisms to guarantee it beat earnings estimates by 0.01 which eventually resulted in krispy kreme reducing net income over 2 years of over 10.5 million in may 2016 , jab beech , a german investment firm , announced it made an offer to purchase the company for 1.35 billion over the following two months that would make the company privately owned in december 2017 , krispy kreme moved corporate operations to charlotte , north carolina ; while winston-salem will remain the world headquarters and maintain the krispy kreme support center on february 19 , 2007 , krispy kreme began selling the whole wheat glazed doughnut in an attempt to appeal to the health conscious on july 1 , 2010 , krispy kreme introduced a doughnut that included the soft drink cheerwine , which was to be sold in grocery stores in north and south carolina during july the doughnuts proved so popular that the salisbury , north carolina , krispy kreme location ( the town where cheerwine is made ) sold them as well also in 2010 , krispy kreme express , a delivery service for businesses , began testing at the battleground avenue location in greensboro , north carolina in the early 2010s , the company began developing shops with tunnel ovens , which allow for an all-day '' hot now '' hot doughnut experience in summer 2019 , krispy kreme announced its return to both downtown chicago in the loop and times square in new york city with plans to open the locations by end of year on august 25 , 2020 , the first krispy kreme vending machine was launched in north carolina , featuring 3-packs of donuts available 24 hours a day besides the stores that krispy kreme operate in the united states and canada , there are also locations in the united kingdom , australia , new zealand , south africa , lebanon , turkey , india , dominican republic , iceland , ireland , kuwait , mexico , panama , russia , taiwan , south korea , malaysia , thailand , indonesia , philippines , japan , singapore , cambodia , united arab emirates , qatar , saudi arabia , bahrain hong kong ( 2006â€“2008 ) , nigeria and ethiopia in august 2011 , krispy kreme 's japan operation planned to increase the number of stores from 21 to 94 , and its mexico operation announced the number of stores would increase from 58 to 128 in five years in the united kingdom , krispy kreme continues its expansion and had plans and funding in place to open further stores in 2012
