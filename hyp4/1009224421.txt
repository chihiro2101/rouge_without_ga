in 1990 , the us congress passed an omnibus crime bill , the crime control act of 1990 , that amended the federal food , drug , and cosmetic act , that classified anabolic steroids as controlled substances and added a new section that stated that a person who '' knowingly distributes , or possesses with intent to distribute , human growth hormone for any use in humans other than the treatment of a disease or other recognized medical condition , where such use has been authorized by the secretary of health and human services '' has committed a felony in addition to increasing height in children and adolescents , growth hormone has many other effects on the body : increases calcium retention , and strengthens and increases the mineralization of bone increases muscle mass through sarcomere hypertrophy promotes lipolysis increases protein synthesis stimulates the growth of all internal organs excluding the brain plays a role in homeostasis reduces liver uptake of glucose promotes gluconeogenesis in the liver contributes to the maintenance and function of pancreatic islets stimulates the immune system increases deiodination of t4 to t3 t.f in the united states , it is legal to give a bovine gh to dairy cows to increase milk production , and is legal to use gh in raising cows for beef ; see article on bovine somatotropin , cattle feeding , dairy farming and the beef hormone controversy hypoglycemia , arginine and propranolol by inhibiting somatostatin release deep sleep insulin glucagon niacin as nicotinic acid ( vitamin b 3 ) fasting vigorous exercise inhibitors of gh secretion include : ghih ( somatostatin ) from the periventricular nucleus circulating concentrations of gh and igf-1 ( negative feedback on the pituitary and hypothalamus ) hyperglycemia glucocorticoids dihydrotestosterone phenothiazines in addition to control by endogenous and stimulus processes , a number of foreign compounds ( xenobiotics such as drugs and endocrine disruptors ) are known to influence gh secretion and function genes for human growth hormone , known as growth hormone 1 ( somatotropin ; pituitary growth hormone ) and growth hormone 2 ( placental growth hormone ; growth hormone variant ) , are localized in the q22-24 region of chromosome 17 and are closely related to somatomammotropin ( also known as placental lactogen ) genes a sustained-release form of growth hormone , nutropin depot ( genentech and alkermes ) was approved by the fda in 1999 , allowing for fewer injections ( every 2 or 4 weeks instead of daily ) ; however , the product was discontinued by genentech/alkermes in 2004 for financial reasons ( nutropin depot required significantly more resources to produce than the rest of the nutropin line ) '' the other study , published in 1958 , was conducted on six people : the same subject as the science paper ; an 18-year-old male with statural and sexual retardation and a skeletal age of between 13 and 14 years ; a 15-year-old female with well-documented hypopituitarism secondary to a craniopharyngioma ; a 53-year-old female with carcinoma of the breast and widespread skeletal metastases ; a 68-year-old female with advanced postmenopausal osteoporosis ; and a healthy 24-year-old medical student without any clinical or laboratory evidence of systemic disease stimulators of growth hormone ( gh ) secretion include : peptide hormones ghrh ( somatocrinin ) through binding to the growth hormone-releasing hormone receptor ( ghrhr ) ghrelin through binding to growth hormone secretagogue receptors ( ghsr ) sex hormones increased androgen secretion during puberty ( in males from testes and in females from adrenal cortex ) testosterone and dhea estrogen clonidine and l-dopa by stimulating ghrh release α4β2 nicotinic agonists , including nicotine , which also act synergistically with clonidine dea : genotropin quote : '' the illicit distribution of hgh occurs as the result of physicians illegally prescribing it for off-label uses , and for the treatment of fda-approved medical conditions without examination and supervision '' claims for gh as an anti-aging treatment date back to 1990 when the new england journal of medicine published a study wherein gh was used to treat 12 men over 60 and some articles in the popular press , such as those criticizing the pharmaceutical industry for marketing drugs for off-label use ( with concern of ethics violations ) have made strong statements about whether doctors can prescribe hgh off-label : '' unlike other prescription drugs , hgh may be prescribed only for specific uses the first description of the use of gh as a doping agent was dan duchaine 's '' underground steroid handbook '' which emerged from california in 1982 ; it is not known where and when gh was first used this way also , under united states law , products sold as dietary supplements can not have claims that the supplement treats or prevents any disease or condition , and the advertising material must contain a statement that the health claims are not approved by the fda one survey of adults that had been treated with replacement cadaver gh ( which has not been used anywhere in the world since 1985 ) during childhood showed a mildly increased incidence of colon cancer and prostate cancer , but linkage with the gh treatment was not established as of 2005 , recombinant growth hormones available in the united states ( and their manufacturers ) included nutropin ( genentech ) , humatrope ( lilly ) , genotropin ( pfizer ) , norditropin ( novo ) , and saizen ( merck serono ) in a 2012 article in vanity fair , when asked how hgh prescriptions far exceed the number of adult patients estimated to have hgh-deficiency , dragos roman , who leads a team at the fda that reviews drugs in endocrinology , said '' the f.d.a furthermore , these variants circulate partially bound to a protein ( growth hormone-binding protein , ghbp ) , which is the truncated part of the growth hormone receptor , and an acid-labile subunit ( als ) this section has also been interpreted by some doctors , most notably the authors of a commentary article published in the journal of the american medical association in 2005 , as meaning that prescribing hgh off-label may be considered illegal the study published in 1957 , which was conducted on '' a 13-year-old male with well-documented hypopituitarism secondary to a crainiophyaryngioma , '' found that : '' human and monkey growth hormone resulted in a significant enhancement of nitrogen storage & nbsp ; gh also stimulates , through the jak-stat signaling pathway , the production of insulin-like growth factor 1 ( igf-1 , formerly known as somatomedin c ) , a hormone homologous to proinsulin the main growth hormone produced by recombinant dna technology has the approved generic name ( inn ) somatropin and the brand name humatrope , and is properly abbreviated rhgh in the scientific literature gh has also been used experimentally to treat multiple sclerosis , to enhance weight loss in obesity , as well as in fibromyalgia , heart failure , crohn 's disease and ulcerative colitis , and burns sales are limited by law to treat a rare growth defect in children and a handful of uncommon conditions like short bowel syndrome or prader-willi syndrome , a congenital disease that causes reduced muscle tone and a lack of hormones in sex glands in the united states , because these products are marketed as dietary supplements , it is illegal for them to contain gh , which is a drug since its introduction in 1992 humatrope has been a banned sports doping agent , and in this context is referred to as hgh several companies have attempted to have a version of gh for use in pigs ( porcine somatotropin ) approved by the fda but all applications have been withdrawn it is extremely rare for such a tumor to occur in childhood , but , when it does , the excessive gh can cause excessive growth , traditionally referred to as gigantism diagnosis of gh deficiency involves a multiple-step diagnostic process , usually culminating in gh stimulation tests to see if the patient 's pituitary gland will release a pulse of gh when provoked by various stimuli in particular , a variant of approximately 20 kda originated by an alternative splicing is present in a rather constant 1:9 ratio , while recently an additional variant of ~ 23-24 kda has also been reported in post-exercise states at higher proportions somatotropic cells in the anterior pituitary gland then synthesize and secrete gh in a pulsatile manner , in response to these stimuli by the hypothalamus
