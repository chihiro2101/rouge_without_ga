. a more obvious external change was the fitting of large crane-like davits , each powered by an electric motor and capable of launching six lifeboats which were stored on gantries ; the ship was designed to have eight sets of gantry davits but only five were installed before britannic entered war service , with the difference being made up with boats launched by manually operated welin-type davits as on titanic and olympic the keel for britannic was laid on 30 november 1911 at the harland and wolff shipyard in belfast , on the gantry slip previously occupied by the olympic , 13 months after the launch of that ship , and the arlanza , launched seven days before bruce ismay , director general of the white star line , and lord pirrie , chairman of the harland & wolff shipyard in belfast had decided to build a trio of ocean liners of unmatched size to compete with the cunard line 's lusitania and mauretania not in terms of speed but in terms of luxury and safety by the time the stern was out of the water , the bow had already slammed into the seafloor , as britannics length was greater than the depth of the water , causing major structural damage to the bow before she slipped completely beneath the waves at 09:07 , 55 minutes after the explosion the madison daily leader 27 november 1911.retrieved 4 october 2018 las vegas optic : '' 1,000 foot ship may dock in new york '' , 21 november 1911.retrieved 4 october 2018 according to simon mills , owner of the britannic wreck , a copy of the harland and wolff order book held by the public record office of northern ireland ( proni ref : d2805/ship/1 ) dated october 1911 ( about six months before the titanic disaster ) already shows the name britannic the final design allowed the ship to retain its signature features such as the iconic funnel layout , however , the changes included increasing the ship 's beam to to allow for a double hull along the engine and boiler rooms , and raising six out of the 15 watertight bulkheads up to b deck compared to titanic , the rescue of britannic was facilitated by three factors : the temperature was higher compared to for titanic ) , more lifeboats were available ( 35 were launched and stayed afloat compared to titanics 20 and help was closer ( arrived less than two hours after first distress call compared to three and a half hours for titanic '' when the britannic came to rest , she gained her title as the largest ship lost in the first world war and world 's largest sunken passenger ship . these facilities were installed but were soon removed because the ship was converted to a hospital ship and were never re-installed because the ship sank before she could enter transatlantic service , so the planned facilities were either cancelled , destroyed , reused on other vessels ( like olympic ) , or just never used with a gross tonnage of 48,158 , she surpassed the other olympic 's in terms of internal volume , but that did not make her the largest passenger ship in service at that time ; the german ss leviathan held this title with a significantly higher tonnage when the remains were moved to the new cemetery at syros in june 1921 , it was found that there was no record relating this name with the loss of the ship , and the grave was registered as unidentified the effect of the ship 's starboard list and the weight of the rudder made attempts to navigate the ship under its own power difficult , and the steering gear was knocked out by the explosion , which eliminated steering by the rudder the admiralty recalled the britannic back into service as a hospital ship on 26 august 1916 , and the ship returned to the mediterranean sea for a fourth voyage on 24 september of that year . the wreck of britannic is in excellent condition , and the only signs of deterioration are the children 's playroom and some of the captain 's quarters , but the rest of the ship is in outstanding shape after completing five successful voyages to the middle eastern theatre and back to the united kingdom transporting the sick and wounded , britannic departed southampton for lemnos at 14:23 on 12 november 1916 , her sixth voyage to the mediterranean sea a number of mine anchors were located off the wreck by sonar expert bill smith , confirming the german records of u-73 that britannic was sunk by a single mine and the damage was compounded by open portholes and watertight doors . in november 2006 , britannic researcher michail michailakis discovered that one of the 45 unidentified graves in the new british cemetery in the town of hermoupolis on the island of syros contained the remains of a soldier collected from the church of ag with the shores of the greek island kea to the right , bartlett gave the order to navigate the ship towards the island in an attempt to beach the vessel the reaction in the dining room was immediate ; doctors and nurses left instantly for their posts but not everybody reacted the same way , as further aft , the power of the explosion was less felt and many thought the ship had hit a smaller boat a bbc2 documentary , titanic 's tragic twin â€“ the britannic disaster , was broadcast on 5 december 2016 ; presented by kate humble and andy torbet , it used up-to-date underwater film of the wreck and spoke to relatives of survivors . at the end of her military service on 6 june 1916 , the britannic returned to belfast to undergo the necessary modifications for transforming her into a transatlantic passenger liner alma katsu 's 2020 novel the deep was set partly on the britannic , and on its sister ship the titanic , and centred around the sinking of both ships in april 2007 , the restorers of a welte organ , now in the in seewen , switzerland , detected that the main parts of the instrument were signed by the german organ builders with '' britanik '' with water also entering the ship 's aft section from the bulkhead between boiler rooms four and five , britannic quickly developed a serious list to starboard due to the weight of the water flooding into the starboard side additional lifeboats could be stored within reach of the davits on the deck house roof , and the gantry davits could reach lifeboats on the other side of the ship , providing that none of the funnels was obstructing the way the results showed that even after 87 years on the bottom of the kea channel , britannic is in much better condition than titanic because the bacteria on her hull have too much competition and are helping protect the wreck by turning it into a man-made reef britannic had a layout very similar to her sister ships however following the loss of titanic and the subsequent inquiries , several design changes were made to the remaining olympic class liner the a deck of the ship was devoted in its entirety to the first class , being fitted with a salon , two veranda cafes , a smoking room and a reading room by morning , britannic was steaming at full speed into the kea channel , between sounion ( the southernmost point of attica , the prefecture that includes athens ) and the island of kea britannic passed gibraltar around midnight on 15 november and arrived at naples on the morning of 17 november , for her usual coalling and water refuelling stop , completing the first stage of her mission this is due to sinking in only of water , causing the bow to hit the seabed before the entire length of the liner was submerged the most important addition was that of individual bathrooms in almost every first class cabin , which would have been a first on an ocean liner ( on the olympic and the titanic , most passengers had to use public bathrooms ) the plan of the britannic showed that she was intended to be more luxurious than her sister ships in order to compete with , ss leviathan and one last dive was to be attempted on britannics boiler room , but it was discovered that photographing this far inside the wreck would lead to violating a permit issued by the ephorate of underwater antiquities , a department within the greek ministry of culture a photograph of a drawing in a company prospectus , found in the welte-legacy in the augustiner museum in freiburg , proved that this was the organ intended for britannic the wreck lies in shallow enough water that scuba divers trained in technical diving can explore it , but it is listed as a british war grave and any expedition must be approved by both the british and greek governments tom mccluskie stated that in his capacity as archive manager and historian at harland and wolff , he '' never saw any official reference to the name 'gigantic ' being used or proposed for the third of the olympic class vessels '' at this point , bartlett concluded that the rate at which britannic was sinking had slowed so he called a halt to the evacuation and ordered the engines restarted in the hope that he might still be able to beach the ship violet jessop ( who was also one of the survivors of britannics sister-ship titanic , and had also been on the olympic , when she collided with described the last seconds ; gleick , elizabeth ; carassava , anthee ( 26 october 1998 ) divers placed her samples on the britannic to look at the colonies of iron-eating bacteria on the wreck , which are responsible for the rusticles growing on titanic the names of the three vessels were decided at a later date and they showed the intention of the designer regarding their size : olympic , titanic and britannic unknown to either bartlett or the ship 's wireless operator , the force of the first explosion had caused the antenna wires slung between the ship 's masts to snap thus , the quality of the third class ( intended for migrants ) was lowered when compared to that of her sisters , while the quality of the second class increased at least one set of documentation exists , in which hingley 's discuss the order for the ship 's anchors ; this documentation states that the name of the ship is gigantic then on 13 november 1915 , britannic was requisitioned as a hospital ship from her storage location at belfast using diver propulsion vehicles , the team made more man-dives to the wreck and produced more images than ever before , including video of four telegraphs , a helm and a telemotor on the captain 's bridge when declared fit for service on 12 december 1915 at liverpool , britannic was assigned a medical team consisting of 101 nurses , 336 non-commissioned officers and 52 commissioned officers as well as a crew of 675 persons in mid-1995 , in an expedition filmed by nova , dr robert ballard , best known for having discovered the wrecks of in 1985 , and the in 1989 , visited the wreck , using advanced side-scan sonar then she took a fearful plunge , her stern rearing hundreds of feet into the air until with a final roar , she disappeared into the depths , the noise of her going resounding through the water with undreamt-of violence although the white star line and the harland and wolff shipyard always denied it , some sources claim that the ship was to be named gigantic a welte-mignon was planned to be installed on board britannic but because of the outbreak of war , the instrument never made its way to belfast on 23 december , she left liverpool to join the port of mudros on the island of lemnos on the aegean sea to bring back sick and wounded soldiers this design enabled all the lifeboats to be launched , even if the ship developed a list that would normally prevent lifeboats being launched on the side opposite to the list in august 1996 , the wreck of hmhs britannic was bought by simon mills , who has written two books about the ship : britannic â€“ the last titan and hostage to fortune realising that there was now no hope of reaching land in time , bartlett gave the final order to stop the engines and sounded two final long blasts of the whistle , the signal to abandon ship
