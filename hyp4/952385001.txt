he takes lestat on a whirlwind tour of heaven and hell , and retells the entirety of history from his own point of view in an effort to convince lestat to join him as god 's adversary even though lestat suspects the entire experience was some kind of deception , he tells his story to armand , david talbot and dora , who have joined him in new york city at the end of the novel , lestat and david go to new orleans although the novel fits into the storyline of the vampire chronicles , the vast majority of it consists of memnoch 's account of cosmology and theology the novel follows up on claims made by david in the tale of the body thief that god and the devil are on better terms than most christians believe it also reinterprets bible stories to create a complete history of earth , heaven and hell that fit neatly with the history of vampires given in the queen of the damned lestat de lioncourt â€“ the main character of the story and the past four books , lestat was created by a powerful vampire named magnus , who promptly cremated himself after creating his heir in the novel prince lestat and the realms of atlantis , it is alluded to that memnoch may have been an inhuman spirit that dwelled in the place between the physical realm and heaven the universe as revealed to lestat by the devil follows the following cosmology : god is a powerful and immortal being worshiped by angels , his first creation , since before the existence of matter and time the addle-brained spirits ( mentioned in the queen of the damned and the witching hour ) are of two types when , as part of this , he experiences sex , god bans memnoch from heaven ; memnoch spends the next three months imparting his vast knowledge of science to humanity , thus inadvertently founding civilization , during which time memnoch realizes that the characteristic that sets humans apart is their ability to love and feel passionate god believes that by appearing in human form , performing miracles , suffering and dying , he will create a religion that will allow more humans to attain the love of god by suffering and sacrifice this is in sharp contrast to memnoch 's approach of attaining purity through love and experience of the wonders of creation for god , this complaint is the last straw : he declares memnoch to be his adversary , and commands him to rule sheol and earth in a devilish form , preparing souls for heaven in his own fashion working in sheol , memnoch creates a form of hell , a place where people who have been bad in life , will be punished until their souls are able to forgive all ( themselves , each other , and god ) for the suffering and ignorance they endured in order to understand the joy of creation and the light of god enough to be ready for heaven memnoch does n't like this work and is constantly asking god to appoint someone else to the job ( as david talbot witnesses in the tale of the body thief ) booth comments that '' if this is the last of the vampire chronicles , it 's a dismal conclusion to an inspiring series of books that won anne rice many admirers
