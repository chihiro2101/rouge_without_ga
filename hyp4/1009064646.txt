melvin santer , '' richard bradley : a unified , living agent theory of the cause of infectious diseases of plants , animals , and humans in the first decades of the 18th century '' , in perspectives in biology and medicine , volume 52 , number 4 , autumn , 2009 , pp a basic form of contagion theory dates back to medicine in the medieval islamic world , where it was proposed by persian physician ibn sina ( known as avicenna in europe ) in the canon of medicine ( 1025 ) , which later became the most authoritative medical textbook in europe up until the 16th century the miasma theory was the predominant theory of disease transmission before the germ theory took hold towards the end of the 19th century , and it is no longer accepted as a scientific theory of disease the italian agostino bassi was the first person to prove that a disease was caused by a microorganism when he conducted a series of experiments between 1808 and 1813 , demonstrating that a '' vegetable parasite '' caused a disease in silkworms known as calcinaccio which was devastating the french silk industry at the time in the sushruta samhita , the ancient indian physician sushruta theorized : '' leprosy , fever , consumption , diseases of the eye , and other infectious diseases spread from one person to another by sexual union , physical contact , eating together , sleeping together , sitting together , and the use of same clothes , garlands and pastes attempts to rigidly apply koch 's postulates to the diagnosis of viral diseases in the late 19th century , at a time when viruses could not be seen or isolated in culture , may have impeded the early development of the field of virology '' the roman statesman marcus terentius varro ( 116–27 bc ) wrote , in his rerum rusticarum libri iii ( three books on agriculture , 36 bc ) : '' precautions must also be taken in the neighborhood of swamps … because there are bred certain minute creatures which can not be seen by the eyes , which float in the air and enter the body through the mouth and nose and there cause serious diseases it held that diseases such as cholera , chlamydia infection , or the black death were caused by a , ancient greek : '' pollution '' ) , a noxious form of '' bad air '' emanating from rotting organic matter as a specific example , all doctors and virologists agree that poliovirus causes paralysis in just a few infected subjects , and the success of the polio vaccine in preventing disease supports the conviction that the poliovirus is the causative agent singer , charles and dorothea ( 1917 ) '' the scientific position of girolamo fracastoro 1478 ?
