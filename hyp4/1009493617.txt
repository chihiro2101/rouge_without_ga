along with françois couperin , rameau was a master of the 18th-century french school of harpsichord music , and both made a break with the style of the first generation of harpsichordists whose compositions adhered to the relatively standardised suite form , which had reached its apogee in the first decade of the 18th century and successive collections of pieces by louis marchand , gaspard le roux , louis-nicolas clérambault , jean-françois dandrieu , élisabeth jacquet de la guerre , charles dieupart and nicolas siret '' camille saint-saëns ( by editing and publishing the pièces in 1895 ) and paul dukas were two other important french musicians who gave practical championship to rameau 's music in their day , but interest in rameau petered out again , and it was not until the late 20th century that a serious effort was made to revive his works he was highly demanding and bad-tempered , unable to maintain longstanding partnerships with his librettists , with the exception of louis de cahusac , who collaborated with him on several operas , including les fêtes de l'hymen et de l'amour ( 1747 ) , zaïs ( 1748 ) , naïs ( 1749 ) , zoroastre ( 1749 ; revised 1756 ) , la naissance d'osiris ( 1754 ) , and anacréon ( the first of rameau 's operas by that name , 1754 ) rameau 's musical works may be divided into four distinct groups , apart from the pieces written for the paris fairs , which have n't survived which differ greatly in importance : a few cantatas ; a few motets for large chorus ; some pieces for solo harpsichord or harpsichord accompanied by other instruments ; and , finally , his works for the stage , to which he dedicated the last thirty years of his career almost exclusively nothing of the kind is to be found in french opera of the day ; since lully , the text had to remain comprehensible—limiting certain techniques such as the vocalise , which was reserved for special words such as ( '' glory '' ) or ( '' victory '' ) but there are also works of pure virtuosity that resemble domenico scarlatti ( '' les tourbillons , '' '' les trois mains '' ) as well as pieces that reveal the experiments of a theorist and musical innovator ( '' l'enharmonique , '' '' les cyclopes '' ) , which had a marked influence on louis-claude daquin , joseph-nicolas-pancrace royer and jacques duphly a few pieces are particularly striking , such as the overture to zaïs , depicting the chaos before the creation of the universe , that of pigmalion , suggesting the sculptor 's chipping away at the statue with his mallet , or many more conventional depictions of storms and earthquakes , as well perhaps as the imposing final chaconnes of les indes galantes or dardanus ( en ) gavotte with doubles hypermedia by jeff hall & tim smith at the binaural collaborative hypertext – shockwave player required – ( '' gavotte with doubles '' link ng ) ( en ) jp.rameau.free.fr rameau – le site ( fr ) musicologie.org biography , list of works , bibliography , discography , theoretical writings , in french ( en ) jean-philippe rameau / discography magnatune les cyclopes by rameau in on-line mp3 format ( played by trevor pinnock ) jean-philippe rameau , '' l'orchestre de louis xv '' – suites d'orchestre , le concert des nations , dir it is difficult to imagine him among the leading wits , including voltaire ( to whom he bears more than a passing physical resemblance ) , who frequented la poupelinière 's salon ; his music was his passport , and it made up for his lack of social graces as a man , he was secretive , solitary , irritable , proud of his own achievements ( more as a theorist than as a composer ) , brusque with those who contradicted him , and quick to anger the genius of his creation rests on one hand on his perfect artistic permeation by folk-dance types , on the other hand on the constant preservation of living contact with the practical requirements of the ballet stage , which prevented an estrangement between the expression of the body from the spirit of absolute music rameau appeared revolutionary to the lullyistes , disturbed by complex harmony of his music ; and reactionary to the '' philosophes , '' who only paid attention to its content and who either would not or could not listen to the sound it made building the operatic museum : eighteenth-century opera in fin-de-siècle paris ( university of rochester press , 2013 ) girdlestone , cuthbert , jean-philippe rameau : his life and work ( dover paperback edition , 1969 ) holden , amanda , ( ed ) the viking opera guide ( viking , 1993 ) sadler , graham , ( ed financial security came late to him , following the success of his stage works and the grant of a royal pension ( a few months before his death , he was also ennobled and made a knight of the ordre de saint-michel ) sometimes he would meet the young writer chabanon , who noted some of rameau 's disillusioned confidential remarks : '' day by day , i 'm acquiring more good taste , but i no longer have any genius '' and '' the imagination is worn out in my old head ; it 's not wise at this age wanting to practise arts that are nothing but imagination according to one of rameau 's admirers , cuthbert girdlestone , this opera has a distinctive place in his works : '' the profane passions of hatred and jealousy are rendered more intensely than in his other works and with a strong sense of reality it was during the latter that the action progressed while the audience waited for the next aria ; on the other hand , the text of the arias was almost entirely buried beneath music whose chief aim was to show off the virtuosity of the singer he lived with his wife and two of his children in his large suite of rooms in rue des bons-enfants , which he would leave every day , lost in thought , to take a solitary walk in the nearby gardens of the palais-royal or the tuileries on a strictly musical level , 18th-century french baroque opera is richer and more varied than contemporary italian opera , especially in the place given to choruses and dances but also in the musical continuity that arises from the respective relationships between the arias and the recitatives the incomprehension rameau received from his contemporaries stopped him from repeating such daring experiments as the second trio des parques in hippolyte et aricie , which he was forced to remove after a handful of performances because the singers had been either unable or unwilling to execute it correctly rameau and couperin had different styles , and it seems they did not know one another : couperin was one of the official court musicians ; rameau , fifteen years his junior , achieved fame only after couperin 's death a subtle equilibrium existed between the more and the less musical parts : melodic recitative on the one hand and arias that were often closer to arioso on the other , alongside virtuoso '' ariettes '' in the italian style it was not until he was approaching 50 that rameau decided to embark on the operatic career on which his fame as a composer mainly rests '' ) rameau 's music includes pieces in the pure tradition of the french suite : imitative ( '' le rappel des oiseaux , '' '' la poule '' ) and characterful ( '' les tendres plaintes , '' '' l'entretien des muses '' ) after his death , it was discovered that he only possessed one dilapidated single-keyboard harpsichord compare the inventories of françois couperin ( one large harpsichord , three spinets and a portable organ ) and louis marchand ( three harpsichords and three spinets ) after their deaths adopting a formula successfully employed by mondonville a few years earlier , rameau fashioned these pieces differently from trio sonatas in that the harpsichord is not simply there as basso continuo to accompany melody instruments ( violin , flute , viol ) but as equal partner in '' concert '' with them the first set of dances ( allemande , courante , sarabande , les trois mains , fanfairenette , la triomphante , gavotte et 6 doubles ) is centred on a major and a minor , while the remaining pieces ( les tricoteuses , l'indifferente , première menuet , deuxième menuet , la poule , les triolets , les sauvages , l'enharmonique , l'egiptienne sic ) are centred around g major and g minor dance music : the danced interludes , which were obligatory even in tragédie en musique , allowed rameau to give free rein to his inimitable sense of rhythm , melody , and choreography , acknowledged by all his contemporaries , including the dancers themselves in 1722 , he returned to paris for good , and here he published his most important work of music theory , traité de l'harmonie ( treatise on harmony ) during the first part of his operatic career ( 1733–1739 ) , rameau wrote his great masterpieces destined for the académie royale de musique : three tragédies en musique and two opéra-ballets that still form the core of his repertoire the french cantata , which should not be confused with the italian or the german cantata , was '' invented '' in 1706 by the poet jean-baptiste rousseau girdlestone p '' his fame subsequently spread throughout all europe , and his treatise became the definitive authority on music theory , forming the foundation for instruction in western music that persists to this day 1110–11 traetta had been advised by algarotti , a leading proponent of reform according to french models ; algarotti was a major influence on the most important '' reformist '' composer , christoph willibald gluck 232 rousseau was a major participant in the second great quarrel that erupted over rameau 's work , the so-called querelle des bouffons of 1752–54 , which pitted french tragédie en musique against italian opera buffa this '' learned '' composer , forever preoccupied by his next theoretical work , also was one who strung together gavottes , minuets , loures , rigaudons , passepieds , tambourins , and musettes by the dozen he was educated at the jesuit college at godrans , but he was not a good pupil and disrupted classes with his singing , later claiming that his passion for opera had begun at the age of twelve heavily influenced by new cartesian modes of thought and analysis , rameau 's methodology incorporated mathematics , commentary , analysis and a didacticism that was specifically intended to illuminate , scientifically , the structure and principles of music this was due to be followed by a final tragédie en musique , les boréades ; but for unknown reasons , the opera was never produced and had to wait until the late 20th century for a proper staging in fact , it seems that his thriftiness was the result of long years spent in obscurity ( when his income was uncertain and scanty ) rather than part of his character , because he could also be generous rameau 's music , so graceful and attractive , completely contradicts the man 's public image and what we know of his character as described ( or perhaps unfairly caricatured ) by diderot in his satirical novel rameau 's nephew this time , rameau was accused of being out of date and his music too complicated in comparison with the simplicity and '' naturalness '' of a work like pergolesi 's la serva padrona after the interval of 1740 to 1744 , he became the official court musician , and for the most part , composed pieces intended to entertain , with plenty of dance music emphasising sensuality and an idealised pastoral atmosphere he made his acquaintance of most of them at la poupelinière 's salon , at the société du caveau , or at the house of the comte de livry , all meeting places for leading cultural figures of the day rct 43 – hippolyte et aricie ( 1733 ;
