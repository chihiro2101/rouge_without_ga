in other organisms , eyes are located so as to maximise the field of view , such as in rabbits and horses , which have monocular vision the last common ancestor of animals possessed the biochemical toolkit necessary for vision , and more advanced eyes have evolved in 96 % of animal species in six of the ~35 main phyla in most vertebrates and some molluscs , the eye works by allowing light to enter and project onto a light-sensitive layer of cells at the end of the eye , known as the retina such eyes are typically roughly spherical , filled with a transparent gel-like substance called the vitreous humour , with a focusing lens and often an iris ; the relaxing or tightening of the muscles around the iris change the size of the pupil , thereby regulating the amount of light that enters the eye , and reducing aberrations when there is enough light the eyes of most cephalopods , fish , amphibians and snakes have fixed lens shapes , and focusing vision is achieved by telescoping the lens—similar to how a camera focuses biomedia associates educational biology site : what animal has a more sophisticated eye , octopus or insect ? compound eyes are found among the arthropods and are composed of many simple facets which , depending on the details of anatomy , may give either a single pixelated image or multiple images , per eye with each eye viewing a different thing , a fused image from all the eyes is produced in the brain , providing very different , high-resolution images for example , jumping spiders have a large pair of simple eyes with a narrow field of view , supported by an array of other , smaller eyes for peripheral vision some insect larvae , like caterpillars , have a different type of simple eye ( stemmata ) which usually provides only a rough image , but ( as in sawfly larvae ) can possess resolving powers of 4 degrees of arc , be polarization-sensitive and capable of increasing its absolute sensitivity at night by a factor of 1,000 or more there are ten different eye layouts—indeed every technological method of capturing an optical image commonly used by human beings , with the exceptions of zoom and fresnel lenses , occur in nature pit eyes , also known as stemma , are eye-spots which may be set into a pit to reduce the angles of light that enters and affects the eye-spot , to allow the organism to deduce the angle of incoming light the resolution of pit eyes can be greatly improved by incorporating a material with a higher refractive index to form a lens , which may greatly reduce the blur radius encountered—hence increasing the resolution obtainable heterogeneous eyes have evolved at least nine times : four or more times in gastropods , once in the copepods , once in the annelids , once in the cephalopods , and once in the chitons , which have aragonite lenses ocelli ( pit-type eyes of arthropods ) blur the image across the whole retina , and are consequently excellent at responding to rapid changes in light intensity across the whole visual field ; this fast response is further accelerated by the large nerve bundles which rush the information to the brain focusing the image would also cause the sun 's image to be focused on a few receptors , with the possibility of damage under the intense light ; shielding the receptors would block out some light and thus reduce their sensitivity this fast response has led to suggestions that the ocelli of insects are used mainly in flight , because they can be used to detect sudden changes in which way is up ( because light , especially uv light which is absorbed by vegetation , usually comes from above ) multiple lenses are seen in some hunters such as eagles and jumping spiders , which have a refractive cornea : these have a negative lens , enlarging the observed image by up to 50 % over the receptor cells , thus increasing their optical resolution an alternative to a lens is to line the inside of the eye with '' mirrors '' , and reflect the image to focus at a central point the nature of these eyes means that if one were to peer into the pupil of an eye , one would see the same image that the organism would see , reflected back out each of the two eyes of a spookfish collects light from both above and below ; the light coming from above is focused by a lens , while that coming from below , by a curved mirror composed of many layers of small reflective plates made of guanine crystals compared with simple eyes , compound eyes possess a very large view angle , and can detect fast movement and , in some cases , the polarisation of light this type of compound eye , for which a minimal size exists below which effective superposition can not occur , is normally found in nocturnal insects , because it can create images up to 1000 times brighter than equivalent apposition eyes , though at the cost of reduced resolution in the parabolic superposition compound eye type , seen in arthropods such as mayfly , the parabolic surfaces of the inside of each facet focus light from a reflector to a sensor array some insects have a so-called single lens compound eye , a transitional type which is something between a superposition type of the multi-lens compound eye and the single lens eye found in animals with simple eyes the shrimp has an eye of the refracting superposition type , in the rear behind this in each eye there is a single large facet that is three times in diameter the others in the eye and behind this is an enlarged crystalline cone the vitreous is the transparent , colourless , gelatinous mass that fills the space between the lens of the eye and the retina lining the back of the eye it is of rather similar composition to the cornea , but contains very few cells ( mostly phagocytes which remove unwanted cellular debris in the visual field , as well as the hyalocytes of balazs of the surface of the vitreous , which reprocess the hyaluronic acid ) , no blood vessels , and 98–99 % of its volume is water ( as opposed to 75 % in the cornea ) with salts , sugars , vitrosin ( a type of collagen ) , a network of collagen type ii fibres with the mucopolysaccharide hyaluronic acid , and also a wide array of proteins in micro amounts this is based upon the shared genetic features of all eyes ; that is , all modern eyes , varied as they are , have their origins in a proto-eye believed to have evolved some 540 million years ago , and the pax6 gene is considered a key factor in this phenotypic convergence of the geometry of cephalopod and most vertebrate eyes creates the impression that the vertebrate eye evolved from an imaging cephalopod eye , but this is not the case , as the reversed roles of their respective ciliary and rhabdomeric opsin classes and different lens crystallins show however , the ancestors of modern hagfish , thought to be the protovertebrate , were evidently pushed to very deep , dark waters , where they were less vulnerable to sighted predators , and where it is advantageous to have a convex eye-spot , which gathers more light than a flat or concave one the thin overgrowth of transparent cells over the eye 's aperture , originally formed to prevent damage to the eyespot , allowed the segregated contents of the eye chamber to specialise into a transparent humour that optimised colour filtering , blocked harmful radiation , improved the eye 's refractive index , and allowed functionality outside of water the transparent protective cells eventually split into two layers , with circulatory fluid in between that allowed wider viewing angles and greater imaging resolution , and the thickness of the transparent layer gradually increased , in most species with the transparent crystallin protein for instance , the distribution of photoreceptors tends to match the area in which the highest acuity is required , with horizon-scanning organisms , such as those that live on the african plains , having a horizontal line of high-density ganglia , while tree-dwelling creatures which require good all-round vision tend to have a symmetrical distribution of ganglia , with acuity decreasing outwards from the centre of course , for most eye types , it is impossible to diverge from a spherical form , so only the density of optical receptors can be altered optical superposition eyes are constrained to a spherical shape , but other forms of compound eyes may deform to a shape where more ommatidia are aligned to , say , the horizon , without altering the size or density of individual ommatidia an extension of this concept is that the eyes of predators typically have a zone of very acute vision at their centre , to assist in the identification of prey on the other hand , the eyes of organisms which operate in low light levels , such as around dawn and dusk or in deep water , tend to be larger to increase the amount of light that can be captured eyes can be the most visible parts of organisms , and this can act as a pressure on organisms to have more transparent eyes at the cost of function for example , if each pattern is 1.75 & nbsp ; cm wide and is placed at 1 m distance from the eye , it will subtend an angle of 1 degree , so the number of white/black bar pairs on the pattern will be a measure of the cycles per degree of that pattern the highest such number that the eye can resolve as stripes , or distinguish from a grey block , is then the measurement of visual acuity of the eye in primates , geckos , and other organisms , these take the form of cone cells , from which the more sensitive rod cells evolved the alternative , developed by organisms that had lost these oil droplets in the course of evolution , is to make the lens impervious to uv light—this precludes the possibility of any uv light being detected , as it does not even reach the retina rods can not distinguish colours , but are responsible for low-light ( scotopic ) monochrome ( black-and-white ) vision ; they work well in dim light as they contain a pigment , rhodopsin ( visual purple ) , which is sensitive at low light intensity , but saturates at higher ( photopic ) intensities in humans , there are three types of cones , maximally sensitive to long-wavelength , medium-wavelength , and short-wavelength light ( often referred to as red , green , and blue , respectively , though the sensitivity peaks are not actually at these colours ) when rods and cones are stimulated by light , they connect through adjoining cells within the retina to send an electrical signal to the optic nerve fibres the pigment molecules used in the eye are various , but can be used to define the evolutionary distance between different groups , and can also be an aid in determining which are closely related—although problems of convergence do exist c-opsins are also found in some derived bilaterian-invertebrate eyes , such as the pallial eyes of the bivalve molluscs ; however , the lateral eyes ( which were presumably the ancestral type for this group , if eyes evolved once there ) always use r-opsins file : three main layers of the eye.png the structures of the eye labelled file : three internal chambers of the eye.png another view of the eye and the structures of the eye labelled file : anatomy of eye.jpg thumb anatomy of the human eye created with wolfram language
