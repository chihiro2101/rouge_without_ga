not match those of its predecessor ( except for switzerland , where it is a-ha 's best-selling album ) ned raggett of allmusic guide would later write of the album , '' the opening two songs alone make for one of the best one-two opening punches around : the tense edge of the title track , featuring one of morten harket 's soaring vocals during the chorus and a crisp , pristine punch in the music , and 'the swing of things , ' a moody , elegant number with a beautiful synth/guitar arrangement ( plus some fine drumming courtesy of studio pro michael sturgis ) and utterly lovelorn lyrical sentiments that balance on the edge of being overheated without quite going over.the '80s may be long gone , but scoundrel days makes clear that not everything was bad back then '' in may 1988 , a-ha
