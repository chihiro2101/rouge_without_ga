the rayon itself is basically pure cellulose cuprammonium rayon has properties similar to viscose ; however , during its production , the cellulose is combined with copper and ammonia ( schweizer 's reagent ) the durability and appearance retention of regular viscose rayons are low , especially when wet ; also , rayon has the lowest elastic recovery of any fiber modal is used alone or with other fibers ( often cotton or spandex ) in clothing and household items like pajamas , underwear , bathrobes , towels , and bedsheets : c 6 h 5 ( oh ) 4 -ona + cs 2 & nbsp ;
