) international differences in well-being , 2010 , oxford university press , new york , the word is mostly used in relation to two factors : the current experience of the feeling of an emotion ( affect ) such as pleasure or joy , or of a more general sense of 'emotional condition as a whole' being in good spirits , quick to laugh and slow to anger , at peace and untroubled , confident and comfortable in your own skin , engaged , energetic and full of life in my view , it ’ s much more important for them to be satisfied , to experience life satisfaction , from the perspective of ‘ what i remember , ’ of the story they tell about their lives '' , 1.1 2011 , '' ‘ happiness ’ is often used , in ordinary life , to refer to a short-lived state of a person , frequently a feeling of contentment : ‘ you look happy today ’ ; ‘ i ’ m very happy for you ’ and in philosophy it is possible to speak of the happiness of a person ’ s life , or of their happy life , even if that person was in fact usually pretty miserable in my view , it ’ s much more important for them to be satisfied , to experience life satisfaction , from the perspective of ‘ what i remember , ’ of the story they tell about their lives 'can happiness be measured ' , action for happiness , includes measures of current experience ( emotions , moods , and feelings ) and of life satisfaction see subjective well-being components of swb for instance sonja lyubomirsky has described happiness as “ the experience of joy , contentment , or positive well-being , combined with a sense that one 's life is good , meaningful , and worthwhile ” the how of happiness , lyubomirsky , 2007 eudaimonia , is a greek term variously translated as happiness , welfare , flourishing , and blessedness '' mark baum character , the big short ( film ) , for instance the correlation of income levels has been shown to be substantial with life satisfaction measures , but to be far weaker , at least above a certain threshold , with current experience measures if the results hold up , the upshot appears to be that income is pretty strongly related to life satisfaction , but weakly related to emotional well-being , at least above a certain threshold '' section 3.3 , happiness , stanford encyclopedia of philosophy , '' high income improves evaluation of life but not emotional well-being '' , daniel kahneman and angus deaton , proceedings of the national academy of sciences , 21/9/10 whereas nordic countries often score highest on swb surveys , south american countries score higher on affect-based surveys of current positive life experiencing it is sometimes used as a current emotional report – “ how happy are you now ? , ” sometimes as a remembered emotion , as in “ how happy were you yesterday ? , ” and very often as a form of life evaluation , as in “ how happy are you with your life as a whole these days ? ” people answer these three types of happiness question differently , so it is important to keep track of what is being asked the main linguistic argument for using happiness in a broader generic role is that happiness plays two important roles within the science of well-being , appearing once as a prototypical positive emotion and again as part of a cognitive life evaluation question the converse argument made in the world happiness reports is that this double usage helps to justify using happiness in a generic role , as long as the alternative meanings are clearly understood and credibly related evaluative answers , in response to questions about life as a whole , are supported by positive emotions , as noted above , but also driven much more , than are answers to questions about emotions , by a variety of life circumstances , including income , health and social trust traditional european societies , inherited from the greeks and from christianity , often linked happiness with morality , which was concerned with the performance in a certain kind of role in a certain kind of social life however , with the rise of individualism , begotten partly by protestantism and capitalism , the links between duty in a society and happiness were gradually broken happiness is no longer defined in relation to social life , but in terms of individual psychology in the nicomachean ethics , written in 350 bce , aristotle stated that happiness ( also being well and doing well ) is the only thing that humans desire for their own sake , unlike riches , honour , health or friendship thus understood , the happy life is the good life , that is , a life in which a person fulfills human nature in an excellent way nietzsche instead wants us to consider the value of what is difficult , what can only be earned through struggle , difficulty , pain and thus to come to see the affirmative value suffering and unhappiness truly play in creating everything of great worth in life , including all the highest achievements of human culture , not least of all philosophy in 2004 darrin mcmahon claimed , that over time the emphasis shifted from the happiness of virtue to the virtue of happiness not all cultures seek to maximise happiness , see the work of jeanne tsai see life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness meaning of '' happiness '' ref in advaita vedanta , the ultimate goal of life is happiness , in the sense that duality between atman and brahman is transcended and one realizes oneself to be the self in all in catholicism , the ultimate end of human existence consists in felicity , latin equivalent to the greek eudaimonia , or '' blessed happiness '' , described by the 13th-century philosopher-theologian thomas aquinas as a beatific vision of god 's essence in the next life in temporal life , the contemplation of god , the infinitely beautiful , is the supreme delight of the will beatitudo , or perfect happiness , as complete well-being , is to be attained not in this life , but the next beyond the routine of needs fulfillment , maslow envisioned moments of extraordinary experience , known as peak experiences , profound moments of love , understanding , happiness , or rapture , during which a person feels more whole , alive , self-sufficient , and yet a part of the world since 2000 the field of positive psychology has expanded drastically in terms of scientific publications , and has produced many different views on causes of happiness , and on factors that correlate with happiness if you seek it , you wo n't find it , because seeking is the antithesis of happiness ” eckhart tolle , a new earth : awakening to your life 's purpose '' wealth , like happiness , is never attained when sought after directly the only chance is to treat , not happiness , but some end external to it , as the purpose of life let your self-consciousness , your scrutiny , your self-interrogation , exhaust themselves on that ; and if otherwise fortunately circumstanced you will inhale happiness with the air you breathe , without dwelling on it or thinking about it , without either forestalling it in imagination , or putting it to flight by fatal questioning and i still hold to it as the best theory for all those who have but a moderate degree of sensibility and of capacity for enjoyment ; that is , for the great majority of mankind some commentators focus on the difference between the hedonistic tradition of seeking pleasant and avoiding unpleasant experiences , and the eudaimonic tradition of living life in a full and deeply satisfying way several scales have been developed to measure happiness : the subjective happiness scale ( shs ) is a four-item scale , measuring global subjective happiness from 1999 the affect measures panas ( panas ) from 1988 is a 20-item questionnaire , using a five-point likert scale ( 1 very slightly or not at all , 5 extremely ) to assess the relation between personality traits and positive or negative affects at '' this moment , today , the past few days , the past week , the past few weeks , the past year , and in general '' positive experience ; the survey by gallup asks if , the day before , people experienced enjoyment , laughing or smiling a lot , feeling well-rested , being treated with respect , learning or doing something interesting happiness is evaluated , as in “ how happy are you with your life as a whole ? ” , and in emotional reports , as in “ how happy are you now ? , ” and people seem able to use happiness as appropriate in these verbal contexts as of 2016 , no evidence of happiness causing improved physical health has been found ; the topic is being researched at the lee kum sheung center for health and happiness at the harvard t.h a positive relationship has been suggested between the volume of the brain 's gray matter in the right precuneus area and one 's subjective happiness score sonja lyubomirsky has estimated that 50 percent of a given human 's happiness level could be genetically determined , 10 percent is affected by life circumstances and situation , and a remaining 40 percent of happiness is subject to self-control in politics , happiness as a guiding ideal is expressed in the united states declaration of independence of 1776 , written by thomas jefferson , as the universal right to '' the pursuit of happiness it has to be kept in mind that the word happiness meant '' prosperity , thriving , wellbeing

judgement reflect , in part , the presence of salient constraints , and that fairness , autonomy , community and engagement are key aspects of happiness and wellbeing throughout the life course since 2003 , empirical research in the field of happiness economics , such as that by benjamin radcliff , professor of political science at the university of notre dame , supported the contention that in democratic countries life satisfaction is strongly and positively related to the social democratic model of a generous social safety net , pro-worker labor market regulations , and strong labor unions see also this collection of full-text peer reviewed scholarly articles on this subject by radcliff and colleagues ( from '' social forces , '' '' the journal of politics , '' and '' perspectives on
