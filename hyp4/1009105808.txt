in the 1930s , the government of nazi germany began arresting thousands of jehovah 's witnesses who refused to salute the nazi flag and sent them to concentration camps their religious beliefs include a literal version of exodus , chapter 20 , verses 4 and 5 , which says : '' thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image , or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above , or that is in the earth beneath , or that is in the water under the earth ; thou shalt not bow down thyself to them nor serve them following the gobitis decision , the west virginia legislature amended its statutes to require all schools in the state to conduct courses of instruction in history , civics , and in the constitutions of the united states and of the state '' for the purpose of teaching , fostering and perpetuating the ideals , principles and spirit of americanism , and increasing the knowledge of the organization and machinery of the government '' the board of education on january 9 , 1942 , adopted a resolution containing recitals taken largely from the court 's gobitis opinion and ordering that the salute to the flag become '' a regular part of the program of activities in the public schools '' , that all teachers and pupils '' shall be required to participate in the salute honoring the nation represented by the flag ; provided , however , that refusal to salute the flag be regarded as an act of insubordination , and shall be dealt with accordingly '' objections to the salute ( the bellamy salute , see image ) as '' being too much like hitler 's '' were raised by a variety of organizations , including the parent-teacher association , the boy scouts and girl scouts , the red cross , and the general federation of women 's clubs what was required after the modification was a roman salute , the saluter to keep the right hand raised with palm turned up while the following is repeated : '' i pledge allegiance to the flag of the united states of america and to the republic for which it stands ; one nation , indivisible , with liberty and justice for all this expulsion , in turn , automatically exposed the child and their parents to criminal prosecution ; the expelled child was considered '' unlawfully absent '' and could be proceeded against as a delinquent , and their parents or guardians could be fined as much as 50 and jailed up to thirty days marie and gathie barnett were jehovah 's witnesses attending slip hill grade school near charleston , west virginia , who were instructed by their father not to salute the flag or recite the pledge , and were expelled for their refusal jackson center and the supreme court historical society , at the jackson center in jamestown , new york : moderator : what was your parents ' decision about how to handle this situation : the school has a mandatory flag salute , thanks to the state education department regulation , and you have your religious belief ? gathie barnette edmonds : when we went home , of course , they understood and they said not to worry about it the barnetts brought suit in the united states district court for themselves and others similarly situated asking its injunction to restrain enforcement of these laws and regulations against jehovah 's witnesses , and prevailed , with the three-judge panel stating : the school district subsequently appealed roosevelt 's subsequent appointment of wiley rutledge , had created a shift on views of the first amendmentâ€”for instance , the court overturned a precedent set a mere nine months prior in jones v the court held , in a 6-to-3 decision delivered by justice jackson , that it was unconstitutional for public schools to compel students to salute the flag gobitis ( 1940 ) , finding that the flag salute was '' a form of utterance '' and '' a primitive but effective means of communicating ideas '' the court wrote that any '' compulsory unification of opinion '' was doomed to failure and was antithetical to the values set forth in the first amendment jackson called symbols a '' primitive but effective way of communicating ideas '' , and explained that '' a person gets from a symbol the meaning he puts into it , and what is one man 's comfort and inspiration is another 's jest and scorn '' jackson rejected frankfurter 's argument , citing the roman effort to drive out christianity , the spanish inquisition of the jews and the siberian exile of soviet dissidents as evidence of the '' ultimate futility '' of efforts to coerce unanimous sentiment out of a populace '' then jackson dealt with frankfurter 's assertion that forcing students to salute the flag , and threatening them with expulsion if they chose not to , was a permissible way to foster national unity jackson responded that the conflict , in this case , was between authority and the individual and that the founders intended the bill of rights to put some rights out of reach from majorities , ensuring that some liberties would endure beyond political majorities jackson wrote : the last leg of frankfurter 's gobitis opinion reasoned that matters like saluting the flag were issues of '' school discipline '' that are better left to local officials rather than federal judges '' frankfurter 's response to jackson 's systematic destruction of his gobitis decision was one of anger , and justices roberts and murphy tried to get him to revise his opinion , arguing that the first two lines were '' much too personal '' frankfurter , however , insisted that the passage was necessary since he claimed he was '' literally flooded with letters '' following the court 's decision in gobitis that said he should be more sensitive to the protection of minorities due to his jewish heritage
