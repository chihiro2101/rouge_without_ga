lúthien was a telerin ( sindarin ) princess , the only child of thingol , king of doriath , and his queen , melian the maia , making her half-royal , half-divine lúthien 's romance with the mortal man beren is considered the '' chief '' of the silmarillion tales by tolkien himself ; he called it '' the kernel of the mythology '' in contrast , lúthien 's descendant arwen was called evenstar , the evening star of the elves , meaning that her beauty reflects that of lúthien tinúviel the story of lúthien and beren is mirrored in the tale of aragorn and arwen the name lúthien appears to mean '' daughter of flowers '' in a beleriandic dialect of sindarin , but it can also be translated '' blossom '' beren saw lúthien dancing under moonrise in her father 's forest , and fell in love with her , for she was the most beautiful of elves and men he stood in the shadows wishing to be near enough to lúthien to touch her , but daeron , her childhood friend and partner in music and dance , noticed beren and , believing him to be a wild animal , shouted for lúthien to flee though melian warned her husband against it , thingol was determined not to let beren marry his daughter , and set a seemingly impossible task as the bride price : beren had to bring him one of the silmarils from morgoth 's iron crown lúthien had a vision of beren lying suffering in the hellish pits of the lord of wolves , and horror weighed upon her heart beren told thingol that the quest was , indeed , fulfilled , and that he held a silmaril in his hand in grief , lúthien lay down and died , going to the halls of mandos , lord of the dead there she sang a song of woe before the throne of mandos , of the tribulations and suffering of both elves and men , the greatest ever sung , so touching that mandos was moved to pity for the only time he summoned beren from the houses of the dead , and lúthien 's spirit met his for the last time by the shores of the sea even manwë could not change the fate of men , and so he presented lúthien with the only choice possible : to live in the immortal land of valinor , where she could forget all her grief and enjoy eternal happiness along with her people and the valar , but without beren ; or to return to middle-earth with beren as a mortal herself , accepting the doom of men the beauty of lúthien combined with the splendour of the gem and necklace made her home of tol galen the fairest land east of valinor , but the silmaril hastened beren 's and lúthien 's end , since her beauty enhanced by the jewel was too bright for mortal lands to bear in the various versions of the tale of tinúviel , tolkien 's earliest form of his tale , as published in the book of lost tales , her original name is tinúviel ( lúthien was invented later ) in his place , they face tevildo , the prince of cats , a monstrous cat who is the principal enemy of the valinorean hound huan however tolkien initially created the character of beren as a mortal man before this in an even earlier but erased version of the tale the story is also told in an epic poem in the lays of beleriand , upon which most of the finer details of her life and relationship to beren is extracted from in this article , since the silmarillion provides only a generalization of the tale in a letter to his son christopher , dated 11 july 1972 , tolkien requested the inscription below for his wife edith 's grave '' for she was ( and knew she was ) my lúthien '' in a footnote to this letter , tolkien added '' she knew the earliest form of the legend.also the poem eventually printed as aragorn 's song '' particularly affecting for tolkien was edith 's conversion to the catholic church from the church of england for his sake upon their marriage ; this was a difficult decision for her that caused her much hardship , paralleling the difficulties and suffering of lúthien from choosing mortality the tale of beren and lúthien also shares an element with folktales such as the welsh culhwch and olwen and others — namely , the disapproving parent who sets a seemingly impossible task ( or tasks ) for the suitor , which is then fulfilled
