according to abraham geiger , the sadducaic sect of judaism drew their name from zadok , the first high priest of israel to serve in the first temple , with the leaders of the sect proposed as the kohanim ( priests , the '' sons of zadok '' , descendants of eleazar , son of aaron ) 20– the name zadok is related to the root ṣāḏaq ( to be right , just ) , which could be indicative of their aristocratic status in society in the initial period of their existence 76 flavius josephus mentions in antiquities of the jews that '' one judas , a gaulonite , of a city whose name was gamala , who taking with him sadduc , a pharisee , became zealous to draw them to a revolt '' the second temple period is the period in ancient israel between the construction of the second temple in jerusalem in 516 bce and its destruction by the romans in 70 ce thus began the roman period of judea , leading to the creation of the province of roman judea in 6 ce and extending into the 7th century ce , well beyond the end of the second temple period after a few years of conflict , the romans retook jerusalem and destroyed the temple , bringing an end to the second temple period in 70 ce during the persian period , the temple became more than the center of worship in judea after its reconstruction in 516 bce ; it served as the center of society the democratizing forces of the hellenistic period lessened and shifted the focus of judaism away from the temple and in the 3rd century bce , a scribal class began to emerge after the destruction of the temple of jerusalem in 70 & nbsp ; ce , the sadducees appear only in a few references in the talmud in the beginnings of karaism , the followers of anan ben david were called '' sadducees '' and set a claim of the former being a historical continuity from the latter the written law , in its depiction of the priesthood , corroborated the power and enforced the hegemony of the sadducees in judean society the sadducees did not believe in resurrection of the dead , but believed ( contrary to the claim of josephus ) in the traditional jewish concept of sheol for those who had died the sadducees , however , in defiance of jewish tradition , whenever dividing the inheritance among the relatives of the deceased , such as when the deceased left no issue , would perfunctorily seek for familial ties , regardless and irrespective of gender , so that the near of kin to the deceased and who inherits his property could , hypothetically , be his paternal aunt though the sadducees produced no primary works themselves , their attributes can be derived from other contemporaneous texts , namely , the new testament , the dead sea scrolls , and later , the mishnah and talmud the dead sea scrolls , which are often attributed to the essenes , suggest clashing ideologies and social positions between the essenes and the sadducees the scrolls suggest that the sadducees ( manasseh ) and the pharisees ( ephraim ) became religious communities that were distinct from the essenes , the true judah clashes between the essenes and the sadducees are depicted in the pesher on nahum , which states '' they manasseh are the wicked ones '' pesher on nahum in eshol , 40 the reference to the sadducees as those who reign over israel corroborates their aristocratic status as opposed to the more fringe group of essenes furthermore , it suggests that the essenes challenged the authenticity of the rule of the sadducees , blaming the downfall of ancient israel and the siege of jerusalem on their impiety the dead sea scrolls brand the sadducaic elite as those who broke the covenant with god in their rule of the judean state , and thus became targets of divine revenge jesus subsequently defends his belief in resurrection against sadducaic resistance , stating , '' and as for the dead being raised , have you not read in the book of moses , in the story about the bush , how god said to him '' i am the god of abraham , the god of isaac , and the god of jacob ? '' he is god not of the dead , but of the living ; you are quite wrong josephus , the author of the most extensive historical account of the second temple period , gives a lengthy account of jewish sectarianism in both the jewish war and antiquities of the jews in antiquities , he describes '' the pharisees have delivered to the people a great many observances by succession from their fathers , which are not written in the law of moses , and for that reason it is that the sadducees reject them and say that we are to esteem those observance to be obligatory which are in the written word , but are not to observe what are derived from the tradition of our forefathers the rabbis , who are traditionally seen as the descendants of the pharisees , describe the similarities and differences between the two sects in yadaim
