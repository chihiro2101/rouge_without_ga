elemental or universal patterns such as '' door '' or '' partnership '' are versatile ideals of design , either as found in experience or for use as components in practice , explicitly described as holistic resolutions of the forces in recurrent contexts and circumstances , whether in architecture , medicine , software development or governance , etc in pattern languages for design , the parts break down in this way : the language description – the vocabulary – is a collection of named , described solutions to problems in a field of interest in the language description , grammar and syntax cross index ( often with a literal alphabetic index of pattern names ) to other named solutions , so the designer can quickly think from one solution to related , needed solutions , and document them in a logical way at the same time , if the pattern language has worked well for many projects , there is reason to believe that even a designer who does not completely understand the design problem at first will complete the design process , and the result will be usable just as words must have grammar and semantic relationships to each other in order to make a spoken language useful , design patterns must be related to each other in position and utility order to form a pattern language christopher alexander 's work describes a process of decomposition , in which the designer has a problem ( perhaps a commercial assignment ) , selects a solution , then discovers new , smaller problems resulting from the larger solution eventually all of the remaining design problems are small enough or routine enough to be solved by improvisation by the builders , and the '' design '' is done in the language , therefore , each pattern has to indicate its relationships to other patterns and to the language as a whole the most difficult part of having an outside expert apply a pattern language is in fact to get a reliable , complete list of the problems to be solved so , alexander famously advocated on-site improvisation by concerned , empowered users , alexander , christopher , the oregon project as a powerful way to form very workable large-scale initial solutions , maximizing the utility of a design , and minimizing the design rework the desire to empower users of architecture was , in fact , what led alexander to undertake a pattern language project for architecture in the first place an important aspect of design patterns is to identify and document the key ideas that make a good system different from a poor system ( that may be a house , a computer program or an object of daily use ) , and to assist in the design of future systems a pattern must characterize the problems that it is meant to solve , the context or situation where these problems arise , and the conditions under which the proposed solutions can be recommended usually the author of a pattern language or collection chooses a generic structure for all the patterns it contains , breaking each into generic sections like context , problem statement , solution etc christopher alexander 's patterns , for instance , each consist of a short name , a rating ( up to two ' ' symbols ) , a sensitizing picture , the context description , the problem statement , a longer part of text with examples and explanations , a solution statement , a sketch and further references for instance , the problem statement and the solution statement are printed in bold font , the latter is always preceded by the '' therefore : '' keyword a pattern language , as conceived by alexander , contains links from one pattern to another , so when trying to apply one pattern in a project , a designer is pushed to other patterns that are considered helpful in its context a pattern that is linked to in the '' references '' usually addresses a problem of lower scale , that is suggested as a part of the higher-scale problem even without the pattern description , these links , along with meaningful names , carry a message : when building a place outside where people can spend time ( '' public outdoor room '' ) , consider to surround it by stairs where people can sit ( '' stair seats '' ) alexander draws a parallel to the hierarchy of a grammar – that is one argument for him to speak of a pattern language the original concept for the book a pattern language was that it would be published in the form of a 3-ring binder , so that pages could easily be added later ; this proved impractical in publishing a recipe or other sequential set of steps to be followed , with only one correct path from start to finish , is also not a pattern language name : chocolatechipratio context : you are baking chocolate chip cookies in small batches for family and friends consider these patterns first : sugarratio , flourratio , eggratio problem : determine the optimum ratio of chocolate chips to cookie dough solution : observe that most people consider chocolate to be the best part of the chocolate chip cookie the framework and philosophy of the '' pattern language '' approach was initially popularized in the book a pattern language that was written by christopher alexander and five colleagues at the center for environmental structure in berkeley , california in the late 1970s while a pattern language contains 253 '' patterns '' from the first pattern , '' independent regions '' ( the most general ) to the last , '' things from your life '' , alexander 's book the timeless way of building goes into more depth about the motivation and purpose of the work the following definitions of '' pattern '' and '' pattern language '' are paraphrased from a pattern language : '' a pattern is a careful description of a perennial solution to a recurring problem within a building context , describing one of the configurations that brings life to a building each pattern describes a problem that occurs over and over again in our environment , and then describes the core solution to that problem , in such a way that you can use the solution a million times over , without ever doing it the same way twice the book liberating voices : a pattern language for communication revolution , containing 136 patterns for using information and communication to promote sustainability , democracy and positive social change , was published in 2008 along with a website containing even more patterns ward cunningham , the inventor of wiki , coauthored a paper with michael mehaffy arguing that there are deep relationships between wikis and pattern languages , and that wikis '' were in fact developed as tools to facilitate efficient sharing and modifying of patterns '' a pattern language for pattern writing by gerard meszaros and jim doble use of patterns for scenario development for large scale aerospace projects lean startup business model pattern what is a quality use case ? from the book patterns for effective use cases patternlanguage.com , by the center for environmental structure fused grid – a contemporary urban pattern '' a collection and synthesis of neighbourhood patterns '' hcipatterns.org – patterns for hci the portland pattern repository group works : a pattern language for bringing life to meetings and other gatherings – a pattern language of group process the core protocols – a set of team communication patterns liberating voices ! pattern language project — short versions of patterns available in arabic , chinese , and spanish fi : suunnittelumalli
