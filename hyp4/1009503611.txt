one of mitchel 's first steps into irish politics was to face down threats of orange retaliation by helping arrange , in september 1839 , a public dinner in newry for daniel o'connell , the leader of the campaign to repeal the acts of union 1800 and restore a reformed irish parliament ch iii until his marriage , john mitchel had by and large taken his politics from his father who , according to mitchel 's early biographer william dillon , had '' begun to comprehend the degradation of his countrymen '' in october 1842 , his friend john martin sent mitchel the first copy of the nation produced in dublin by charles gavan duffy , previously editor of the o'connellite journal , the vindicator , in belfast , and by thomas osborne davis , and john blake dillon , both like himself protestants and graduates of trinity college '' i think the nation will do very well '' , he wrote martin , while at the same time revealing that he knew how the country '' ought to take '' news that an additional 20,000 british troops were to be deployed to ireland but would not put it on paper for fear of arrest he co-authored an editorial with thomas davis , '' the anti-irish catholics '' , in which he embraced davis 's promotion of the irish language and of gaelic ireland as a non-sectarian basis for a common irish nationality he reviewed the speeches of john philpot curran , a pamphlet by isaac butt on the protection of home industry , the age of pitt and fox , and later on the poets and dramatists of ireland , edited by denis florence maccarthy ( 4 april 1846 ) ; the industrial history of free nations , by torrens mccullagh , and c on 25 october 1845 mitchel wrote on '' the people 's food '' , pointing to the failure of the potato crop , and warning landlords that pursuing their tenants for rents would force them to sell their other crops and starve the nation newspaper , 1845 on 8 november , in an article titled '' the detectives '' , he wrote , '' the people are beginning to fear that the irish government is merely a machinery for their destruction ; that it is unable , or unwilling , to take a single step for the prevention of famine , for the encouragement of manufactures , or providing fields of industry , and is only active in promoting , by high premiums and bounties , the horrible manufacture of crimes ! '' '' the nation newspaper , 1846 in an article on '' english rule '' on 7 march 1846 , mitchel wrote : '' the irish people are expecting famine day by day they behold their own wretched food melting in rottenness off the face of the earth , and they see heavy-laden ships , freighted with the yellow corn their own hands have sown and reaped , spreading all sail for england ; they see it and with every grain of that corn goes a heavy curse '' 195-6 the grouping around the nation that o'connell had taken to calling '' young ireland '' , a reference to giuseppe mazzini 's anti-clerical and insurrectionist young italy , withdrew from the repeal association in january 1847 , they formed themselves anew as the irish confederation with , in michael doheny words , the '' independence of the irish nation '' the objective and '' no means to attain that end abjured , save such as were inconsistent with honour , morality and reason '' the book was a success : '' an early incursion of carlylean thought into the romantic construction of the irish nation that was to dominate militant irish politics for a century mitchel 's response was not join o'connell in proclaiming himself '' the friend of liberty in every clime , class and color '' o'connell , an address in conciliation hall , in dublin on september 29 , 1845 recorded by frederick douglass in a letter to william lloyd garrison this duffy discovered in 1847 when conceding temporary editorship of the nation to mitchel he found that he had lent a journal , '' recognised throughout the world as the mouthpiece of irish rights '' , to '' the monstrous task of applauding negro slavery and of denouncing the emancipation of the jews '' see also ( another of o'connell 's liberal causes against which mitchel stood with carlyle ) he '' had watched the progress of the famine policy of the government , and could see nothing in it but a machinery , deliberately devised , and skilfully worked , for the entire subjugation of the island—the slaughter of portion of the people , and the pauperization of the rest , '' and he had therefore '' come to the conclusion that the whole system ought to be met with resistance at every point '' while he would admit no principle that distinguished his position from the '' conspirators of ninety-eight '' ( the original united irishmen ) , mitchel emphasised that he was not recommending '' an immediate insurrection '' : in the '' present broken and divided condition '' of the country '' the people would be butchered '' with finton lalor he urged '' passive resistance '' : the people should '' obstruct and render impossible the transport and shipment of irish provisions '' and by intimidation in necessary suppress bidding for grain or cattle if brought '' to auction under distress '' , a method that had demonstrated its effectiveness in the tithe war that the life of one peasant was as precious as the life of one nobleman or gentleman ; that the property of the farmers and labourers of ireland was as sacred as the property of all the noblemen and gentlemen in ireland , and also immeasurably more valuable ; and that every freeman , and every man who desired to become free , ought to have arms , and to practise the use of them '' the earl of clarendon , englishman , calling himself her majesty 's lord lieutenant – general and general governor of ireland , '' mitchel stated that the purpose of the journal was to resume the struggle which had been waged by tone and emmet , the holy war to sweep this island clear of the english name and nation commenting on this first edition of the united irishman , lord stanley in the house of lords , on 24 february 1848 , maintained that the paper pursued '' the purpose of exciting sedition and rebellion among her majesty 's subjects in ireland 1888 convicted in june by a jury he dismissed as '' packed '' ( as '' not empanelled even according to the law of england '' ) , mitchel was sentenced to be '' transported beyond the seas for the term of fourteen years '' from the dock he declared that he was satisfied that he had '' shown what the law is made of in ireland '' , and that he regretted nothing : '' the course which i have opened is only commenced '' mitchel was first transported to ireland island , bermuda ( arriving on the 20th of june , 1848 , aboard the steamer hms scourge ) , where under harsh conditions the royal navy was using convict labour to carve out a dockyard and naval base mitchel , aided by patrick james smyth , escaped from the van dieman 's land in 1853 and made his way ( via tahiti , san francisco , nicaragua and cuba ) to the new york once in the united states , mitchel had not hesitated to repeat the claim that negroes were '' an innately inferior people '' he denied it was a crime , '' or even a peccadillo to hold slaves , to buy slaves , to keep slaves to their work by flogging or other needful correction '' the value and virtue of slavery , '' both for negroes and white men '' , he maintained from 1857 in the pages of the southern citizen , a paper he moved in 1859 from knoxville , tennessee to washington d.c after the secession from the american union of several southern states in february 1861 and the battle of fort sumter ( during which his son john commanded a south carolina battery ) , mitchel was anxious to return although he had been among the first to claim that slavery had not been not the cause of the conflict but simply the pretext for northern aggression , mitchel objected : to allow blacks their freedom was to concede that the south had been in the wrong from the start his biographer anthony russell notes that it was '' with no trace of irony at all '' , that mitchel wrote : …if freedom be a reward for negroes – that is , if freedom be a good thing for negroes – why , then it is , and always was , a grievous wrong and crime to hold them in slavery at all bell 's '' journal of liberty , literature , and social progress '' , irish republic , cautioned readers '' interested in the labor question '' from associating themselves with john mitchel ( a '' miserable man '' ) and with a '' diabolical '' democratic plan to impose upon blacks in the south , '' as a substitute for chattel slavery , a system of serfdom scarcely less hateful than the institution it is intended to practically prolong '' mitchel dedicated his paper to '' aspirants to the privileges of american citizenship ” , arguing that the more integrated ( or '' more lost '' ) among american citizens the irish in america were '' the better ” hughes , like mitchel , had suggested that the conditions of '' starving laborers '' in the north were often worse than that of slaves in the south , and in 1842 he had urged his flock not to sign o'connell 's abolitionist petition ( '' an address of the people of ireland to their countrymen and countrywomen in america '' ) which he regarded as unnecessarily provocative the freeman ’ s journal opined that : '' after the lapse of a quarter of a century – after the loss of two of his sons … john mitchel again treads his native land , a prematurely aged , enfeebled man while his visit to ireland was ostensibly private , mitchel revealed that he had pressed to stand for british parliament and that it was his intention , if any vacancy should occur , to offer himself as a candidate so that he might '' get the irish members to put in operation the plan suggested by o ’ connell at one time , of declining to attend in parliament altogether , that is , to try to discredit and explode the fraudulent pretence of representation in the parliament of britain '' before re-embarking for ireland , mitchel issued an election address in which he appeared to endorse home rule—together with free education , universal tenant rights , and the freeing of fenian prisoners patrick 's day , 17 march 1875 , expressed his gratitude to the voters of tipperary for supporting him in exposing the ‘ fraudulent ’ system of irish representation in parliament on the day mitchel died , the tipperary paper the the nenagh guardian offered '' an american view of john mitchel '' : a syndicated piece from the chicago tribune that declared mitchel a “ recreant to liberty ” , a defender of slavery and secession with whom “ the union masses of the american people '' could have '' little sympathy '' freeman ’ s journal , 22 march 1875 the standard , with which mitchel had contended in 1847 , concluded : '' his powers through life , however , were marred by want of judgment , obstinate opinionativeness , and a factiousness which disabled him from ever acting long enough with any set of men '' placed in succession to those of theobald wolfe tone , thomas davis , and james fintan lalor , pearse hailed mitchel 's '' gospel of irish nationalism '' as the '' fiercest and most sublime '' pearse 's eulogy was seconded by the sinn féin leader arthur griffith who , however , did feel constrained in a preface to a 1913 edition of mitchel 's jail journal , to comment that an irish nationalist needed no excuse for '' declining to hold the negro his peer in right '' with reference to the black lives matter movement , petitions were launched , receiving over 1,200 signatures from the newry residents , calling for a statue of mitchel in the centre of the town to be removed , and john mitchel place , in which it stands , to be renamed with the support of unionist members who feared “ creating a dangerous precedent ” ( people might '' find other streets and names where they ’ d find fault with it or have some issue from a historical context '' ) , the nationalist majority newry , mourne and down district council , in june 2020 , agreed only that council officers '' proceed to clarify responsibility for the john mitchel statue , develop options for an education programme , identify the origins of john mitchel place and give consideration as to other potential issues in relation to slavery within the council area ” mitchel 's recent biographer , anthony russell , who recommends that mitchel 's statue in newry '' be accompanied by at least an explanation of the context – perhaps even by a work of art condemning slavery '' , argues that mitchel 's stand on slavery was not an aberration the '' reformation of offenders '' was not , he argued , '' the reasonable object of criminal punishment ” : '' why hang them , hang them….you have no right to make the honest people support the rogues….and for 'ventilation'… i would ventilate the rascals in front of the county jails at the end of a rope '' russell suggests that , consistent with his admiration for carlyle , mitchel retained from his education under dr henderson in newry and at trinity college a classicist mindset of fixed hierarchies maintained , as in ancient rome , by a ruthless lack of sentiment faced with the alternative of a social system of the north in which the relation of master to servant was regulated by competition , '' he took his stand in favour of the system that seemed to him the better of the two ; and as was his habit , he took it decisively '' the life and
