unlike e2 , there 's not a lot of unrelated socializing ; almost all of wikipedia 's chat is about improving specific articles or the project as a whole your contributions will be edited , rearranged , re-worded and expanded , and you should n't be shy about doing the same to other people 's work please copy your good encyclopedic content from e2 to wikipedia ! do n't forget to search for related wikipedia content first & mdash ; like e2 , wikipedia has full-text search , and if wikipedia already has an article on the subject , just merge your own content into it : be bold ! mention on the wikipedia article 's talk page ( click '' discuss this page '' ) that you originally wrote the material for e2 and link to your e2 homenode ( like this : yerricde ) , so that nobody thinks you 're committing plagiarism however , you retain the copyright to your own work and are free to modify and redistribute it in any way you wish for the most part , wiki markup resembles that of e2 's auto-formatting tool , but there are a few differences wikipedia titles are generally shorter , so phrases like '' how to '' should be removed , and most titles should only have lower-case letters though you can use html entity escapes for '' , '' , ' ' , you do n't need to ; wikipedia has the wi ki > tag to suppress interpretation of control characters as markup it is similar to e2 's deprecation of '' getting to know you '' nodes , subjective list nodes , and bullshit ( called patent nonsense here ) , but there are subtle differences in the two policies similarly , an article should at any time look like an encyclopedia text , even if it is only a very short one it may take you a little time to get used to the wikipedia approach , but do n't worry too much about it but always keep in mind that wikipedia is an encyclopedia & mdash ; if you want to keep an online diary or write down your personal opinions , e2 and other wikis are probably a better place the everyone account still exists on e2 and may occasionally be useful for adding wikipedia content , especially if it is content you are not substantially responsible for if you are an e2 user who is a member of such a usergroup , you may be able to convince the group to allow you to copy wikipedia material to that account whatever you do , you must attribute the material to wikipedia , and link to the gnu free documentation license as well an italicized paragraph at the top stating this article/writeup is released under the gnu free documentation license , and is a verbatim copy/modified version of an article from wikipedia at as of mm/dd/yyyy , as allowed by that license should satisfy e2 policy on the matter
