969 ) , alleged in the modern day to be a reaction against state and clerical oppression of the byzantine church toponyms which retain the name include the river babuna , the mountain babuna , the bogomila waterfall and village bogomila , all in the azot ( region ) today in central north macedonia , suggesting that the movement was very active in the region there are still over ten thousand banat bulgarians in banat today in the villages of dudeştii vechi , vinga , denta and also in the city of timișoara , with a few in arad ; however , they no longer practice bogomilism , having converted to roman catholicism fine ( in mark pinson , the bosnian muslims ) in 1203 , pope innocent iii , with the aid of the king of hungary , forced an agreement of kulin to acknowledge papal authority and religion : in practice this was ignored in the following centuries , the bosnian church and the heretic sect of the bogomils came to be identified with each other , due to the scarcity of documents after the ottoman conquest the constant change of authority over these lands , and the higher taxes during the time of tsar peter i , gave birth to a great social discontent at the beginning of the 10th century bogomilism was an outcome of many factors that had arisen in the beginning of the 10th century , most probably in the region of macedonia in the province of hum ( modern herzegovina ) the bogomils were also strong , in cities of split and trogir bogomils were numerous but later they took refuge in bosnia the hungarians undertook many crusades against the heretics in bosnia , but towards the close of the 15th century , the conquest of that country by the turks put an end to their persecution due to the constant wars during the time of tsar simeon i , the lands near the byzantine border ( thrace ) were devastated , and the people living there were left without occupation it is difficult to ascertain whether the name was taken from the reputed founder of that movement , the priest bogomil , or whether he assumed that name after it had been given to the sect itself some scholars , who sought certain ideological backgrounds and justifications for their political narratives , argue that both catholics and orthodox persecuted the bogomils as heretics and according to them , the pressures drew bosnia to bogomilism the gradual christianization of the bulgarian population , the fact that the service was initially practiced in greek , which only the elite knew , resulted in a low level of understanding of the religion among the peasantry his followers , who became known as paulicians , were not marked by extreme deviance in lifestyle compared to contemporaries , despite their belief that the world was evil , and were renowned as good fighting men 228-229 ;

cambridge university , providing refuge to those labeled heretics , including bogomils , was a recurrent pretext for hungarian rulers to declare crusades against bosnia and extend their influence in the region the old slavonic lists of forbidden books of the 15th and 16th century also give us a clue to the discovery of this heretical literature and of the means the bogomils employed to carry on their teachings the term bogomil in free translation means '' dear to god '' , and is a compound of the slavic words for '' god '' ( common slavic : bogъ ) and '' dear '' ( common slavic : milъ ) in 1004 , scarcely 25 years after the introduction of christianity into kievan rus , we hear of a priest adrian teaching the same doctrines as the bogomils bogomilism was a native slavic sect from the middle of the 10th century began to flourish while the theophylact of constantinople warned peter i against this new heresy several thousand went in the army of alexios i komnenos against the norman , robert guiscard ; but , deserting the emperor , many of them ( 1085 ) were thrown into prison the church marcion himself established , appeared to die out around the 5th century , although similarities between marcionism and paulicianism , a sect in the same geographical area , indicate that marcionist elements may have survived
