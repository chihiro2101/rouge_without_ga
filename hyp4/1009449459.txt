because there is very rarely enough time or money to gather information from everyone or everything in a population , the goal becomes finding a representative sample ( or subset ) of that population for example , a manufacturer needs to decide whether a batch of material from production is of high enough quality to be released to the customer , or should be sentenced for scrap or rework due to poor quality for example , a researcher might study the success rate of a new 'quit smoking ' program on a test group of 100 patients , in order to predict the effects of the program if it were made available nationwide the population from which the sample is drawn may not be the same as the population about which information is desired sometimes they may be entirely separate – for instance , one might study rats in order to get a better understanding of human health , or one might study records from people born in 2008 in order to make predictions about people born in 2009 in the most straightforward case , such as the sampling of a batch of material from production ( acceptance sampling by lots ) , it would be most desirable to identify and measure every single item in the population and to include any one of them in our sample the most straightforward type of frame is a list of elements of the population ( preferably the entire population ) with appropriate contact information a probability sample is a sample in which every unit in the population has a chance ( greater than zero ) of being selected in the sample , and this probability can be accurately determined ( for example , we can allocate each person a random number , generated from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1 , and select the person with the highest number in each household ) ) in the above example , not everybody has the same probability of selection ; what makes it a probability sample is the fact that each person 's probability is known when every element in the population does have the same probability of selection , this is known as an 'equal probability of selection ' ( eps ) design probability sampling includes : simple random sample , systematic sampling , stratified sampling , probability proportional to size sampling , and cluster or multistage sampling nonprobability sampling is any sampling method where some elements of the population have no chance of selection ( these are sometimes referred to as 'out of coverage'/'undercovered ' ) , or where the probability of selection ca n't be accurately determined information about the relationship between sample and population is limited , making it difficult to extrapolate from the sample to the population within any of the types of frames identified above , a variety of sampling methods can be employed , individually or in combination factors commonly influencing the choice between these designs include : nature and quality of the frame availability of auxiliary information about units on the frame accuracy requirements , and the need to measure accuracy whether detailed analysis of the sample is expected cost/operational concerns in particular , the variance between individual results within the sample is a good indicator of variance in the overall population , which makes it relatively easy to estimate the accuracy of results simple random sampling can be vulnerable to sampling error because the randomness of the selection may result in a sample that does n't reflect the makeup of the population simple random sampling can not accommodate the needs of researchers in this situation , because it does not provide subsamples of the population , and other sampling strategies , such as stratified sampling , can be used instead it is important that the starting point is not automatically the first in the list , but is instead randomly chosen from within the first to the kth element in the list if periodicity is present and the period is a multiple or factor of the interval used , the sample is especially likely to be unrepresentative of the overall population , making the scheme less accurate than simple random sampling for example , consider a street where the odd-numbered houses are all on the north ( expensive ) side of the road , and the even-numbered houses are all on the south ( cheap ) side under the sampling scheme given above , it is impossible to get a representative sample ; either the houses sampled will all be from the odd-numbered , expensive side , or they will all be from the even-numbered , cheap side , unless the researcher has previous knowledge of this bias and avoids it by a using a skip which ensures jumping between the two sides ( any odd-numbered skip ) ( in the two examples of systematic sampling that are given above , much of the potential sampling error is due to variation between neighbouring houses – but because this method never selects two neighbouring houses , the sample will not give us any information on that variation ) as described above , systematic sampling is an eps method , because all elements have the same probability of selection ( in the example given , one in ten ) the ratio of the size of this random selection ( or sample ) to the size of the population is called a sampling fraction second , utilizing a stratified sampling method can lead to more efficient statistical estimates ( provided that strata are selected based upon relevance to the criterion in question , instead of availability of the samples ) even if a stratified sampling approach does not lead to increased statistical efficiency , such a tactic will not result in less efficiency than would simple random sampling , provided that each stratum is proportional to the group 's size in the population third , it is sometimes the case that data are more readily available for individual , pre-existing strata within a population than for the overall population ; in such cases , using a stratified sampling approach may be more convenient than aggregating data across groups ( though this may potentially be at odds with the previously noted importance of utilizing criterion-relevant strata ) finally , since each stratum is treated as an independent population , different sampling approaches can be applied to different strata , potentially enabling researchers to use the approach best suited ( or most cost-effective ) for each identified subgroup within the population first , identifying strata and implementing such an approach can increase the cost and complexity of sample selection , as well as leading to increased complexity of population estimates finally , in some cases ( such as designs with a large number of strata , or those with a specified minimum sample size per group ) , stratified sampling can potentially require a larger sample than would other methods ( although in most cases , the required sample size would be no larger than would be required for simple random sampling ) in choice-based sampling , the data are stratified on the target and a sample is taken from each stratum so that the rare target class will be more represented in the sample in some cases the sample designer has access to an '' auxiliary variable '' or '' size measure '' , believed to be correlated to the variable of interest , for each element in the population another option is probability proportional to size ( 'pps ' ) sampling , in which the selection probability for each element is set to be proportional to its size measure , up to a maximum of 1 example : suppose we have six schools with populations of 150 , 180 , 200 , 220 , 260 , and & nbsp ; 490 students respectively ( total 1500 students ) , and we want to use student population as the basis for a pps sample of size three to do this , we could allocate the first school numbers 1 & nbsp ; to & nbsp ; 150 , the second school 151 to 330 & nbsp ; ( & nbsp ; 150 & nbsp ; + & nbsp ; 180 ) , the third school 331 to 530 , and so on to the last school ( 1011 to & nbsp ; 1500 ) pps sampling is commonly used for surveys of businesses , where element size varies greatly and auxiliary information is often available & nbsp ; – for instance , a survey attempting to measure the number of guest-nights spent in hotels might use each hotel 's number of rooms as an auxiliary variable in the example above , an interviewer can make a single trip to visit several households in one block , rather than having to drive to a different block for each household in the example above , the sample only requires a block-level city map for initial selections , and then a household-level map of the 100 selected blocks , rather than a household-level map of the whole city cluster sampling ( also known as clustered sampling ) generally increases the variability of sample estimates above that of simple random sampling , depending on how the clusters differ between one another as compared to the within-cluster variation accidental sampling ( sometimes known as grab , convenience or opportunity sampling ) is a type of nonprobability sampling which involves the sample being drawn from that part of the population which is close to hand for example , if the interviewer were to conduct such a survey at a shopping center early in the morning on a given day , the people that he/she could interview would be limited to those given there at that given time , which would not represent the views of other members of society in such an area , if the survey were to be conducted at different times of day and several times per week several important considerations for researchers using convenience samples include : are there controls within the research design or experiment which can serve to lessen the impact of a non-random convenience sample , thereby ensuring the results will be more representative of the population ? is there good reason to believe that a particular convenience sample would or should respond or behave differently than a random sample from the same population ? is the question being asked by the research one that can adequately be answered using a convenience sample ? in social science research , snowball sampling is a similar technique , where existing study subjects are used to recruit more subjects into the sample the target population for advertisements can be selected by characteristics like location , age , sex , income , occupation , education or interests using tools provided by the social medium panel sampling is the method of first selecting a group of participants through a random sampling method and then asking that group for ( potentially the same ) information several times over a period of time theoretical sampling occurs when samples are selected on the basis of the results of the data collected so far with a goal of developing a deeper understanding of the area or develop theories sampling schemes may be without replacement ( 'wor ' & nbsp ; – no element can be selected more than once in the same sample ) or with replacement ( 'wr ' & nbsp ; – an element may appear multiple times in the one sample ) for example , if we catch fish , measure them , and immediately return them to the water before continuing with the sample , this is a wr design , because we might end up catching and measuring the same fish more than once sampling enables the selection of right data points from within the larger data set to estimate the characteristics of the whole population it is not necessary to look at all of them to determine the topics that are discussed during the day , nor is it necessary to look at all the tweets to determine the sentiment on each of the topics when respondents misunderstand a question , or find it difficult to answer processing error : mistakes in data coding participation bias : failure to obtain complete data from all selected individuals after sampling , a review should be held of the exact process followed in sampling , rather than that intended , in order to study any effects that any divergences might have on subsequent analysis unit nonresponse ( lack of completion of any part of the survey ) item non-response ( submission or participation in survey but failing to complete one or more components/questions of the survey ) in survey sampling , many of the individuals identified as part of the sample may be unwilling to participate , not have the time to participate ( opportunity cost ) , dillman , d.a this is often addressed by improving survey design , offering incentives , and conducting follow-up studies which make a repeated attempt to contact the unresponsive and to characterize their similarities and differences with the rest of the frame similarly , households with more than one telephone line have a greater chance of being selected in a random digit dialing sample , and weights can adjust for this in the us the 1936 literary digest prediction of a republican win in the presidential election went badly awry , due to severe bias more than two million people responded to the study with their names obtained through magazine subscription lists and telephone directories
