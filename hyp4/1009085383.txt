in country music , artists such as jimmie rodgers , moon mullican and bob wills introduced elements of swing along with blues to create a genre called '' western swing '' the henderson band also featured coleman hawkins , benny carter , and buster bailey as soloists , who all were influential in the development of swing era instrumental styles louis armstrong used the additional freedom of the new format with 4/4 time , accenting the second and fourth beats and anticipating the main beats with lead-in notes in his solos to create a sense of rhythmic pulse that happened between the beats as well as on them , i.e his approach to rhythm often used accents on the lead-in instead of the main beat , and mixed meters , to build a sense of anticipation to the rhythm and make his playing swing hines ' style was a seminal influence on the styles of swing-era pianists teddy wilson , art tatum , jess stacy , nat '' king '' cole , erroll garner , mary lou williams , and jay mcshann black territory dance bands in the southwest were developing dynamic styles that often went in the direction of blues-based simplicity , using riffs in a call-response pattern to build a strong , danceable rhythm and provide a musical platform for extended solos paul whiteman developed a style he called '' symphonic jazz , '' grafting a classical approach over his interpretation of jazz rhythms in an approach he hoped would be the future of jazz jean goldkette 's victor recording orchestra featured many of the top white jazz musicians of the day including bix beiderbecke , jimmy dorsey , frank trumbauer , pee wee russell , eddie lang , and joe venuti the victor recording orchestra won the respect of the fletcher henderson orchestra in a battle of the bands ; henderson 's cornetist rex stewart credited the goldkette band with being the most influential white band in the development of swing music before benny goodman's , 1976 , music in the twenties : the jean goldkette orchestra , prospects , an annual of american cultural studies 1:179–203 , october 1976 , doi : 10.1017/s0361233300004361 as a dance music promoter and agent , goldkette also helped organize and promote mckinney 's cotton pickers and glen gray 's orange blossoms ( later the casa loma orchestra ) , two other detroit-area bands that were influential in the early swing era as the 1920s turned to the 1930s , the new concepts in rhythm and ensemble playing that comprised the swing style were transforming the sounds of large and small bands starting in 1928 , the earl hines orchestra was broadcast throughout much of the midwest from the grand terrace cafe in chicago , where hines had the opportunity to expound upon his new approaches to rhythm and phrasing with a big band emblematic of the evolving music was the change in the name of moten 's signature tune , from '' moten stomp '' to '' moten swing audiences raved about the new music , and at the pearl theatre in philadelphia in december 1932 , the doors were let open to the public who crammed into the theatre to hear the new sound , demanding seven encores from moten 's orchestra with the early 1930s came the financial difficulties of the great depression that curtailed recording of the new music and drove some bands out of business , including the fletcher henderson orchestra and mckinney 's cotton pickers in 1934 '' sweet '' dance music remained most popular with white audiences but the casa loma orchestra and the benny goodman orchestra went against that grain , targeting the new swing style to younger audiences goodman 's success with '' hot '' swing brought forth imitators and enthusiasts of the new style throughout the world of dance bands , which launched the '' swing era '' that lasted until 1946 swing-era repertoire included the great american songbook of tin pan alley standards , band originals , traditional jazz tunes such as the “ king porter stomp ” , with which the goodman orchestra had a smash hit , and blues swing dancing originated in the late 1920s as the '' lindy hop , '' and would later incorporate other styles including the suzie q , truckin ' , peckin ' jive , the big apple , and the shag in various combinations of moves some of the top jitterbuggers gathered in professional dance troupes such as whitey 's lindy hoppers ( featured in a day at the races , everybody dance , and hellzapoppin ' ) audiences used to traditional '' sweet '' arrangements , such as those offered by guy lombardo , sammy kaye , kay kyser and shep fields , were taken aback by the rambunctiousness of swing music swing was sometimes regarded as light entertainment , more of an industry to sell records to the masses than a form of art , among fans of both jazz and '' serious '' music some jazz critics such as hugues panassié held the polyphonic improvisation of new orleans jazz to be the pure form of jazz , with swing a form corrupted by regimentation and commercialism panassié was also an advocate of the theory that jazz was a primal expression of the black american experience and that white musicians , or black musicians who became interested in more sophisticated musical ideas , were generally incapable of expressing its core values that 's why they introduced '' swing '' which is not a musical form '' ( no comment on fletcher henderson , earl hines , duke ellington , or count basie ) the dixieland revival started in the late 1930s as a self-conscious re-creation of new orleans jazz in reaction against the orchestrated style of big band swing between the poles of hot and sweet , middlebrow interpretations of swing led to great commercial success for bands such as those led by artie shaw , glenn miller and tommy dorsey miller 's trademark clarinet-led reed section was decidedly '' sweet , '' but the miller catalog had no shortage of bouncy , medium-tempo dance tunes and some up-tempo tunes such as mission to moscow and the lionel hampton composition “ flying home ” '' the sentimental gentleman of swing '' tommy dorsey made a nod to the hot side by hiring jazz trumpeter and goodman alumnus bunny berigan , then hiring jimmie lunceford 's arranger sy oliver to spice up his catalog in 1939 new york became a touchstone for national success of big bands , with nationally broadcast engagements at the roseland and savoy ballrooms a sign that a swing band had arrived on the national scene the goodman band 's 1938 carnegie hall concert turned into a summit of swing , with guests from the basie and ellington bands invited for a jam session after the goodman band 's performance 1940 saw top-flight musicians such as charlie parker , dizzy gillespie , don byas , charlie christian , and gene ramey , whose careers in swing had brought them to new york , beginning to coalesce and develop the ideas that would become bebop the early 1940s saw emerging trends in popular music and jazz that would , once they had run their course , result in the end of the swing era the savoy sultans and other smaller bands led by louis jordan , lucky millinder , louis prima , and tony pastor were showcasing an exuberant '' jump swing '' style that would lead to the postwar rise of r & b in a 1939 downbeat interview , duke ellington expressed dissatisfaction with the creative state of swing music ; '' it 's not very difficult to understand the evolution of jazz into swing the earl hines orchestra in 1943 featured a collection of young , forward-looking musicians who were at the core of the bebop movement and would in the following year be in the billy eckstine , the first big band to showcase bebop as the swing era went into decline , it secured legacies in vocalist-centered popular music , '' progressive '' big band jazz , r & b , and bebop big band music would experience a resurgence during the 1950s , but the connection between the later big band music and the swing era was tenuous the stan kenton and woody herman bands maintained their popularity during lean years of the late 1940s and beyond , making their mark with innovative arrangements and high-level jazz soloists ( shorty rogers , art pepper , kai winding , stan getz , al cohn , zoot sims , serge chaloff , gene ammons , sal nistico ) lionel hampton was a leader in the r & b genre during the late 1940s then re-entered big band jazz in the early 1950s , remaining a popular attraction through the 1960s asleep at the wheel has also recorded the count basie tunes “ one o'clock jump ” , “ jumpin ' at the woodside ” , and “ song of the wanderer ” using a steel guitar as a stand-in for a horn section the tours featured bandleaders and vocalists of the swing era who were semi-retired , such as harry james and vocalist dick haymes historically-themed radio broadcasts featuring period comedy , melodrama , and music also played a role in sustaining interest in the music of the swing era
