'' homophone '' derives from the greek homo- & nbsp ; ( ὁμο & 8209 ; ) , '' same '' , and phōnḗ ( φωνή ) , '' voice , utterance '' another vivid example is thomas hood 's use of '' birth '' and '' berth '' and '' told '' and '' toll 'd '' ( tolled ) in his poem '' faithless sally brown '' : : his death , which happen 'd in his berth , : at forty-odd befell : : they went and told the sexton , and : the sexton toll 'd the bell in some accents , various sounds have merged in that they are no longer distinctive , and thus words that differ only by those sounds in an accent that maintains the distinction ( a minimal pair ) are homophonous in the accent with the merger the septet is : : raise , rays , rase , raze , rehs , res , reais other than the two common words raise and rays , there are : raze – a verb meaning '' to demolish , level to the ground '' or '' to scrape as if with a razor '' ; rase – a verb meaning '' to erase '' ; rehs – the plural of reh , a mixture of sodium salts found as an efflorescence in india ; res – the plural of re , a name for one step of the musical scale ; reais – the plural of real , a currency unit of portugal and brazil if proper names are allowed , then a possible nonet would be : ayr ( scottish town ) , aire ( yorkshire river ) , eyre ( legal term and various geographic locations ) , heir , air , err ( some speakers ) , ere ( poetic '' before '' ) , e'er ( poetic '' ever '' , some speakers ) , are ( unit of area ; some speakers ) according to the well-known dictionary duden , these vowels should be distinguished as /ɛ : / and /e : / , but this is not always the case , so that words like ähre ( ear of corn ) and ehre ( honor ) may or may not be homophones individual variation is shown by a pair like gäste ( guests ) – geste ( gesture ) , the latter of which varies between /ˈɡe : stə/ and /ˈɡɛstə/ and by a pair like stiel ( handle , stalk ) – stil ( style ) , the latter of which varies between /ʃtiːl/ and /stiːl/ of these , a few are triples like waagen ( weighing scales ) , wagen ( cart ) , wagen ( to dare ) and waise ( orphan ) – weise ( way , manner ) – weise ( wise ) there are many homophones in japanese , due to the use of sino-japanese vocabulary , where borrowed words and morphemes from chinese are widely used in japanese , but many sound differences , such as the original words ' tones , are lost 二本 , both pronounced nihon , but with different pitches ) , or from context , but many of these words are primarily or almost exclusively used in writing , where they are easily distinguished as they are written with different kanji ; others are used for puns , which are frequent in japanese an extreme example is kikō ( hiragana : きこう ) , which is the pronunciation of at least 22 words ( some quite rare or specialized , others common ; all these examples are two-character compounds ) , including : 機構 ( organization/mechanism ) , 紀行 ( travelogue ) , 稀覯 ( rare ) , 騎行 ( horseback riding ) , 貴校 ( school ( respectful ) ) , 奇功 ( outstanding achievement ) , 貴公 ( word for '' you '' used by men addressing male equals or inferiors ) , 起稿 ( draft ) , 奇行 ( eccentricity ) , 機巧 ( contrivance ) , 寄港 ( stopping at port ) , 帰校 ( returning to school ) , 気功 ( breathing exercise/qigong ) , 寄稿 ( contribute an article/written piece ) , 機甲 ( armor , e.g of a tank ) , 帰航 ( homeward voyage ) , 奇効 ( remarkable effect ) , 季候 ( season/climate ) , 気孔 ( stoma ) , 起工 ( setting to work ) , 気候 ( climate ) , 帰港 ( returning to port ) due to chinese being pronounced with varying tones and korean 's removal of those tones , and because the modern korean writing system , hangeul , has a more finite number of phonemes than , for example , latin-derived alphabets such as that of english , there are many homonyms with both the same spelling and pronunciation yì , for example , has at least 125 homophones , and it is the pronunciation used for chinese characters such as 义 , 意 , 易 , 亿 , 议 , 一 , and 已 for example , the standard chinese word 狮子 ( shīzi , meaning '' lion '' ) was simply 狮 ( shī ) in classical chinese , and the standard mandarin word 教育 ( jiàoyù , '' education '' ) was simply 教 ( jiào ) in classical chinese in one line of the song , the singer says , wo yao shuijiao ( 我要水饺 ) , which means '' i want dumplings '' , but the chinese speaker misunderstands the english speaker and thought he wanted to sleep because if tones are disregarded shuijiao ( 睡觉 ) can also mean '' to sleep '' for example , the graphemes and digraphs '' d '' , '' gi '' , and '' r '' are all pronounced /z/ in the hanoi dialect , so the words dao ( knife ) , giao ( delivery ) , and rao ( advertise ) are all pronounced /zaw˧/ in saigon dialect , however , the graphemes and digraphs '' d '' , '' gi '' , and '' v '' are all pronounced /j/ , so the words dao ( knife ) , giao ( delivery ) , and vao ( enter ) are all pronounced /jaw˧/ for example , the words sắc ( sharp ) and xắc ( dice ) are both pronounced /săk˧˥/ in hanoi dialect , but pronounced /ʂăk˧˥/ and /săk˧˥/ in saigon dialect respectively
