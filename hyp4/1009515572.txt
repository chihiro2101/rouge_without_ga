in a 2013 study , 39 % of infants ( 6 to 14 months ) and 97 % of toddlers ( 18 to 24 months ) demonstrated a hand preference the theory suggests it is more efficient for the brain to divide major tasks between the hemispheres—thus most people may use the non-speaking ( right ) hemisphere for work requiring fine motor skills , facilitating the use of speech while working , and resulting in right-handedness left-handed people have a heterogeneous brain organization where the hemispheres are either organized as in right-handers , but with hemispheres reversed ; or such that both hemispheres are used for verbal processing two theoretical single-gene models have been proposed to explain the patterns of inheritance of handedness , by marian annett of the university of leicester , and by chris mcmanus of ucl performed a genome-wide association study for a measure of relative hand skill and found that genes involved in the determination of left/right asymmetry in the body play a key role in handedness in fact , every major disorder in which patients show reduced right-handedness is associated with either vestibular abnormalities or delay , and asymmetry of the vestibular cortex is strongly correlated with the direction of handedness in his book right-hand , left-hand , chris mcmanus of university college london argues that the proportion of left-handers is increasing , and that an above-average quota of high achievers have been left-handed he says that left-handers ' brains are structured in a way that increases their range of abilities , and that the genes that determine left-handedness also govern development of the brain 's language centers he also found that left-handers were overrepresented among those with lower cognitive skills and mental impairments , with those with intellectual disability ( id ) being roughly twice as likely to be left-handed , as well as generally lower cognitive and non-cognitive abilities amongst left-handed children what they discovered was that when a child developed a consistent use of their right or left hand during infancy ( such as using the right hand to put the pacifier back in , or grasping random objects with the left hand ) , they were more likely to have superior language skills as a toddler left-handers as a group differ from right-handers , and are more heterogeneous than right-handers , in perception of certain stereo illusions , such as the octave illusion , the scale illusion , and the glissando illusion a 2012 study showed that nearly 40 % of children with cerebral palsy were left-handed , while another study demonstrated that left-handedness was associated with a 62 percent increased risk of parkinson 's disease in women , but not in men as handedness is a highly heritable trait associated with various medical conditions , and because many of these conditions could have presented a darwinian fitness challenge in ancestral populations , this indicates left-handedness may have previously been rarer than it currently is , due to natural selection study , researchers from lafayette college and johns hopkins university concluded that there was no statistically significant correlation between handedness and earnings for the general population , but among college-educated people , left-handers earned 10 to 15 % more than their right-handed counterparts however , more recently , in a 2014 study published by the national bureau of economic research , harvard economist joshua goodman finds that left-handed people earn 10 to 12 percent less over the course of their lives than right-handed people , right-handed ) batsman more than a right-handed bowler does , because the angle of a bowler 's delivery to an opposite-handed batsman is much more penetrating than that of a bowler to a same-handed batsman ( see wasim akram ) while studies of handedness show that only 10 % of the general population is left-handed , the proportion of left-handed mlb players is closer to 39 % of hitters and 28 % of pitchers , according to 2012 data because a left-handed pitcher faces first base when he is in position to throw to the batter , whereas a right-handed pitcher has his back to first base , a left-handed pitcher has an advantage when attempting to pickoff baserunners at first base defensively in baseball , left-handedness is considered an advantage for first basemen because they are better suited to fielding balls hit in the gap between first and second base , and because they do not have to pivot their body around before throwing the ball to another infielder historically , there have been few left-handed catchers because of the perceived disadvantage a left-handed catcher would have in making the throw to third base , especially with a right-handed hitter at the plate with the ball in the glove on the right hand , a left-handed catcher would have to turn his body to the left to tag a runner on the other hand , the encyclopedia of baseball catchers states : in four wall handball , typical strategy is to play along the left wall forcing the opponent to use their left hand to counter the attack and playing into the strength of a left-handed competitor in handball , left-handed players have an advantage on the right side of the field when attacking , getting a better angle , and that defenders might be unused to them in water polo , the centre forward position has an advantage in turning to shoot on net when rotating the reverse direction as expected by the centre of the opposition defence and gain an improved position to score tight ends , when only one is used , typically line up on the same side as the throwing hand of the quarterback , while the offensive tackle on the opposite hand , which protects the quarterback 's '' blind side , '' is typically the most valued member of the offensive line many tools and procedures are designed to facilitate use by right-handed people , often without realizing the difficulties incurred by the left-handed throughout history , being left-handed was considered negative , or evil ; even into the 20th century , left-handed children were beaten by schoolteachers for writing with their left hand the latin adjective sinister or sinistra ( as applied to male or female nouns ⁠— ⁠latin nouns are gender specific ) means '' left '' as well as '' unlucky '' , and this double meaning survives in european derivatives of latin , including the english words '' sinister '' ( meaning both 'evil ' and 'on the bearer 's left on a coat of arms ' ) and '' ambisinister '' meaning 'awkward or clumsy with both or either hand ' there are many negative connotations associated with the phrase '' left-handed '' : clumsy , awkward , unlucky , insincere , sinister , malicious , and so on in french , gauche means both '' left '' and '' awkward '' or '' clumsy '' , while droit ( e ) ( cognate to english direct and related to '' adroit '' ) means both '' right '' and '' straight '' , as well as '' law '' and the legal sense of '' right '' until very recently in taiwan ( and still in mainland china , japan and korea ) , left-handed people were forced to switch to being right-handed , or at least switch to writing with the right hand due to the importance of stroke order , developed for the comfortable use of right-handed people , it is considered more difficult to write legible chinese characters with the left hand than it is to write latin letters , though difficulty is subjective and depends on the writer because writing when moving one 's hand away from its side towards the other side of the body can cause smudging if the outward side of the hand is allowed to drag across the writing , writing in the latin alphabet might possibly be less feasible with the left hand than the right under certain circumstances depending on the position and inclination of the writing paper , and the writing method , the left-handed writer can write as neatly and efficiently or as messily and slowly as right-handed writers international left-handers day is , according to the club , '' an annual event when left-handers everywhere can celebrate their sinistrality ( left-handedness ) and increase public awareness of the advantages and disadvantages of being left-handed alone there were over 20 regional events to mark the day in 2001 – including left-v-right sports matches , a left-handed tea party , pubs using left-handed corkscrews where patrons drank and played pub games with the left hand only , and nationwide 'lefty zones ' where left-handers ' creativity , adaptability and sporting prowess were celebrated , whilst right-handers were encouraged to try out everyday left-handed objects to see just how awkward it can feel using the wrong equipment ! '' red-necked ( bennett 's ) wallabies ( macropus rufogriseus ) preferentially use their left hand for behaviours that involve fine manipulation , but the right for behaviours that require more physical strength
