, jawbone and chin is part of the beard and removing any of it is counted as a sin , because the messenger said : “ let your beards grow , ” “ leave your beards alone , ” “ let your beards increase , ” “ let your beards be full ways to prevent razor burn include keeping the skin moist , using a shaving brush and lather , using a moisturizing shaving gel , shaving in the direction of the hair growth , resisting the urge to shave too closely , applying minimal pressure , avoiding scratching or irritation after shaving , avoiding irritating products on the shaved area ( colognes , perfumes , etc for example , teenagers may start shaving their face or legs at around 16 , but as they age hair will start to grow more abundantly and thicker , leading some to believe this was due to the shaving , but in reality is just part of the maturation process thumb the electric razor ( electric shaver ) consists of a set of oscillating or rotating blades , which are held behind a perforated metal screen which prevents them from coming into contact with the skin and behaves much like the second blade in a pair of scissors image : napoli bw 2013-05-16 16-24-01.jpg thumb left 250px alexander the great 's shaven image on the alexander mosaic , 2nd century bc before the advent of razors , hair was sometimes removed using two shells to pull the hair out or using water and a sharp tool it may contain an antiseptic agent such as isopropyl alcohol , both to prevent infection from cuts and to act as an astringent to reduce skin irritation , a perfume , and a moisturizer to soften the facial skin observant jewish men are subject to restrictions on the shaving of their beards , as leviticus 19:27 forbids the shaving of the corners of the head and prohibits the marring of the

shaving against the grain hindu , jain and buddhist ( usually only monks or nuns ) temples of shaving or plucking the hair from the scalp of priests and nuns as a symbol of their renunciation of worldly fashion and esteem razor burn is a common problem , especially among those who shave coarse hairs on areas with sensitive skin like the bikini line , pubic hair , armpit , chest , and beard shaving can be done with a straight razor or safety razor ( called 'manual shaving ' or 'wet shaving ' ) or an electric razor ( called 'dry shaving ' ) or beard trimmer some anatomical parts , such as the scrotum , require extra care and more advanced equipment due to the uneven surface of the skin when the testicles shrivel during coldness , or its imbalance when the testicles hang low due to being warmer before wet shaving , the area to be shaved is usually doused in warm to hot water by showering or bathing or covered for several minutes with a hot wet towel to soften the skin and hair the removal of a full beard often requires the use of scissors or an hair trimmer to reduce the mass of hair , simplifying the process according to an estimate by new york city barber charles de zemler , barbers ' shaving revenue dropped from about 50 percent around the time of the spanish–american war to 10 percent in 1939 due to the invention of the safety razor and electric razor it is worked up into a usable lather by the brush , either against the face , in a shaving mug , bowl , scuttle , or palm of the hand many side effects can be minimized by using a fresh blade , applying plenty of lubrication , shaving in the direction of hair growth , and avoiding pressing the razor into the skin in some native american tribes , at the time of contact with british colonists , it was customary for men and women to remove all body hair the initial cost of electric shaving is higher , due to the cost of the shaver itself , but the long-term cost can be significantly lower , since the cutting parts do not need replacement for approximately 18 months and a lathering product is not required this belief arose because hair that has never been cut has a naturally tapered end , as it emerges from the skin 's hair follicle , whereas , after cutting , there is no taper in the united states , getting a straight razor shave in a barbershop and self-shaving with a straight razor were still common in the early 1900s this process removes dead skin cells , reducing the potential for ingrown hairs and allowing the razor to glide across the skin smoothly decreasing the risk of the razor snagging or grabbing causing razor burn the goal is to reduce the amount of hair with each pass , instead of trying to eliminate all of it in a single pass when the razor is held against the skin , the whiskers poke through the holes in the screen and are sliced by the moving blades
