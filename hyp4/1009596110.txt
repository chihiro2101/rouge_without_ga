marshes provide a habitat for many species of plants , animals , and insects that have adapted to living in flooded conditions many of these plants , therefore , have aerenchyma , channels within the stem that allow air to move from the leaves into the rooting zone aquatic animals , from fish to salamander , are generally able to live with a low amount of oxygen in the water marshes have extremely high levels of biological production , some of the highest in the world , and therefore are important in supporting fisheries marshes ( and other wetlands ) are able to absorb water during periods of heavy rainfall and slowly release it into waterways and therefore reduce the magnitude of flooding the three main types of marsh are salt marshes , freshwater tidal marshes , and freshwater marshes they are located close enough to the shoreline that the motion of the tides affects them , and , sporadically , they are covered with water they flourish where the rate of sediment buildup is greater than the rate at which the land level is sinking wetland ecology : principles and conservation ( 2nd edition ) salt marshes are most commonly found in lagoons , estuaries , and on the sheltered side of shingle or sandspit although considered a freshwater marsh , this form of marsh is affected by the ocean tides however , without the stresses of salinity at work in its saltwater counterpart , the diversity of the plants and animals that live in and use freshwater tidal marshes is much higher than in salt marshes the most serious threats to this form of marsh are the increasing size and pollution of the cities surrounding them they can be covered in shallow water , but in the summer and fall , they can be completely dry playa lakes are a form of shallow freshwater marsh that occurs in the southern high plains of the united states like vernal pools , they are only present at certain times of the year and generally have a circular shape the different types are produced by factors such as water level , nutrients , ice scour , and waves restoration can be done on a large scale , such as by allowing rivers to flood naturally in the spring , or on a small scale by returning wetlands to urban landscapes
