amongst the latter , many designs were prompted by the desire to expand the off-road capabilities of land-vehicles to an '' all-terrain '' ability , in some cases not only focused on creating a transport that will work on land and water , but also on intermediates like ice , snow , mud , marsh , swamp etc typically an amphibious atv ( aatv ) is a small , lightweight , off-highway vehicle , constructed from an integral hard plastic or fibreglass bodytub , fitted with six ( sometimes eight ) driven wheels , with low pressure , balloon tires apart from the distinction in sizes mentioned above , two main categories of amphibious vehicles are immediately apparent : those that travel on an air-cushion ( hovercraft ) and those that do not in some of them , the amphibious capabilities are central to their purpose , whereas in others they are only an expansion to what has remained primarily a watercraft or a land vehicle gibbs has also developed other types of fast amphibians including the phibian , a amphibian that is aimed at first responder market , and the humdinga , a amphibian that is capable of traversing extreme terrain in 2010 , a southern california-based company named watercar , set the guinness world record for fastest amphibious vehicle , with their prototype , the python , which reached top land speeds of 204 & nbsp ; km/h ( 127 & nbsp ; mph ) and water speeds of 96 & nbsp ; km/h ( 60 & nbsp ; mph ; 52 knots ) the boats are made of aluminium , are relatively flat-bottomed , and have three , four , or six wheels , depending on the size of the boat the first known self-propelled amphibious vehicle , a steam-powered wheeled dredging barge , named the orukter amphibolos , was conceived and built by united states inventor oliver evans in 1805 , although it is disputed to have successfully travelled over land or water under its own steam sealegs amphibious craft are an example of this , which are a range of aluminium fabricated boats ( mostly ribs ) designed and manufactured in auckland , new zealand since the 1920s , many diverse amphibious vehicles designs have been created for a broad range of applications , including recreation , expeditions , search & rescue , and military , leading to a myriad of concepts and variants some amphibious vehicles , rather than being designed for land transport with the ability to cross water , are designed as water-transport vehicles with the ability to travel on land in the initial tests , the vw had issues on both water and land , the jeep worked well on water but not on land ( the airboat motor left him stranded on the highway ) , and the turboat performed well on land but sank immediately in the water amfibus amphibious buses made by dutch amfibious transport ( dat ) in nijmegen , netherlands are used to operate tours of amsterdam , rotterdam and lübeck , under the splashtours brand the us navy lcac can take troops and materials ( if necessary an m1 abrams tank ) from ship to shore and can access more than 70 % of the world 's coastline , as opposed to conventional landing craft , which are only capable of landing along 17 % of that coastline the sheridan could still cross a body of water , but like its swimming cousin , the m113 armored personnel carrier , also built of aluminium ) the river had to be narrow , less than the m3 amphibious rig can be used as a ferry or as a floating bridge for trucks and heavy combat vehicles according to a 1999 article in military parade magazine , multi-unit , all-terrain transport vehicles were first proposed by the british in 1913 , and by the 1950s , over 40 types of articulated tracked vehicles ( atv ) were in production the distinction is that the vehicles are designed to be high performing on water , with the land transport ability added to give additional functionality , rather than being the main function during the challenge , which was to drive across a reservoir , the toybota made it almost all the way to the end before capsizing , the dampervan immediately sank , and the triumph was the only vehicle to complete the trip , although it took a very long time to do so many modern military vehicles , ranging from light wheeled command and reconnaissance vehicles , through armoured personnel carriers ( apcs ) , tanks and amphibious warfare ships , are manufactured with amphibious capabilities with no suspension ( other than what the tires offer ) and no steering wheels , directional control is accomplished through skid-steering – just as on a tracked vehicle – either by braking the wheels on the side where you want to turn or by applying more throttle to the wheels on the opposite side acvs have a high speed over water ( an sr.n4 mk.1 could do 83 knots ( 95 & nbsp ; mph or 154 & nbsp ; km/h ) ) and can make the transition between land and water at speed—unlike most wheeled or tracked amphibians constructed this way , an aatv will float with ample freeboard and is capable of traversing swamps , ponds , and streams as well as dry land an air-cushion vehicle ( acv ) or hovercraft can travel over land or water supported by a cushion of air ejected downwards against the surface below it many tracked armored vehicles that are primarily intended for land-use , such as armoured fighting vehicles and armoured personnel carriers nevertheless also have amphibious ability , tactically useful inland , reducing dependence on destroyable and easily targeted bridges for propulsion in or on the water some vehicles simply make do by spinning their wheels or tracks , while others can power their way forward more effectively using ( additional ) screw propeller ( s ) or pump-jet the watercar can do 80 & nbsp ; mph ( 129 & nbsp ; km/h ) on land , and 44 & nbsp ; mph ( 38 knots ; 71 & nbsp ; km/h ) on sea , and can transition from land to sea in less than 15 seconds his design , unlike others , could operate not only on rivers and lakes but the sea and did not require firm ground to enter or exit the water the m29 weasel ( studebaker weasel ) , whilst originally designed as a snow vehicle , operated successfully in an amphibious role by the addition of front and rear floats introduced a motorized version of the amphibious cycle that resembles a jet ski on water and motorcycle on land some of the earliest known amphibious vehicles were amphibious carriages , the invention of which is credited to the neapolitan polymath prince raimondo di sangro of sansevero in july 1770 or earlier , or samuel bentham whose design of 1781 was built in june 1787 usually , the front unit houses at least the engine , gearboxes , fuel tank ( s ) and the driver 's compartment , and perhaps there is some space left for cargo or passengers , whereas the rear unit is the primary load carrier one example is the sea tractor , a motor vehicle that can travel through shallow water , with driver and passengers on a raised platform these can take the form of inflatable floatation devices , much like the sides of a rubber dinghy , or a waterproof fabric skirt raised from the top perimeter of the vehicle , to increase its displacement an amphibious cycle is a human-powered vehicle capable of operation on both land and water as long as the opposite bank has a shallow enough slope for the vehicle to climb out within a few miles , they can cross rivers and water obstacles although the vehicles ' wheels were mounted without suspension or steering action , and land speeds over 20 & nbsp ; mph ( 32 & nbsp ; km/h ) were ill-advised , its articulated design provided it with good maneuverability and helped it to keep all four wheels firmly in touch with uneven ground wheeled examples are the brdm-1 and brdm-2 4x4 armored scout cars , as well as the btr-60 , btr-70 , btr-80 and btr-94 8x8 apcs and the btr-90 infantry fighting vehicle these craft can travel up to 39 knots on water , but travel at only 7.5 & nbsp ; km/hr on land , showing the preference for water performance in design the vab is a french fully amphibious apc , powered in the water by two water jets , mounted one on either side of the rear hull ( see detail picture above ) the french panhard vbl is a compact , lightly armored 4x4 all-terrain vehicle that is fully amphibious and can swim at most amphibians will work only as a displacement hull when in the water – only a small number of designs have the capability to raise out of the water when speed is gained , to achieve high velocity hydroplaning , skimming over the water surface like motorboat
