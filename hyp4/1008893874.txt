this is now mainly in all competitions , including club , county and regional , as it is a key factor in judging in 2017 , the method of determining the horizontal displacement from the centre was changed , new markings were added to the bed and zones set up with deductions based on the distance from the centre of the trampoline bed the rules for international competitions ( updated by fig in 2006 ) also require 200mm thick mats on the floor for 2 metres around each trampoline and for there to be four spotters whose task it is to attempt to catch or reduce the impact of an athlete falling off the side of the trampoline bed in the second , which is known as a spotter pass , the athlete does a straight jump from the sloping end to the flat bed to gain height , then after landing on the flat , performs the first skill , then after landing on the flat a second time , performs a second skill as they dismount in the one , which is known as a mounter pass , the athlete performs one skill in the jump from the sloping end to the flat bed and a second skill as they dismount from the flat bed to the landing mat the skills consist of various combinations of somersaults , shaped bounces , body landings and twists performed in various body positions such as the tuck , pike or straight position difficulty is important in a routine , however , there are differences in opinion between various coaches whether it is better to focus on increasing the difficulty of routines given that this usually results in a reduced form score or to focus on improving execution scores by displaying better form in an easier routine rightthe form and difficulty are judged in a similar manner as for trampolining but there are additional deductions for failing to land cleanly ( without stepping ) or landing outside a designated area on the mat the floor matting rules are typically adopted by national bodies but not always in full ; for example in the uk the requirement for national & regional competition is still 2m but only of 20â€“25mm matting the total score is a combination of the degree of difficulty ( dd ) performed plus the total time of flight ( tof ) minus standardized deductions for poor form and mistakes and the horizontal displacement the degree of difficulty ( dd or tariff ) is calculated by adding a factor for each half turn ( or twist ) or quarter somersault the degree of difficulty of the routine is determined in the same way as for individual trampoline routines and the points added to the score to determine the winner since trampolining became an olympic sport , china has also made a very successful effort to develop world-class trampoline gymnasts , their first major success was in the 2007 men 's world championship and later in both men 's and women 's gold medals and a bronze in the 2008 olympic games held in beijing '' time of flight '' is the time spent in the air from the moment the athlete leaves the mat until the time they make contact again and is measured with electronic timing equipment at first the americans were successful at world championship level , but soon european competitors began to dominate the sport and for a number of years , athletes from countries that made up the former soviet union have often dominated the sport
