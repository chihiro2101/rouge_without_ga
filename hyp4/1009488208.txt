a number of films were set against the background of the emergency , including : the planter 's wife ( 1952 ) windom 's way ( 1957 ) the 7th dawn ( 1964 ) the virgin soldiers ( 1969 ) stand up , virgin soldiers ( 1977 ) other media : in the sweeney episode '' the bigger they are '' ( series 4 , episode 8 ; 26 october 1978 ) , the tycoon leonard gold is being blackmailed by harold collins ,

and formed the malayan national liberation army ( mnla ) , although their name has commonly been mistranslated as the malayan races liberation army ( mrla ) or the malayan people 's liberation army ( mpla ) following the end of the malayan emergency in 1960 , the predominantly ethnic chinese malayan national liberation army , the armed wing of the mcp , retreated to the malaysian-thailand border where it regrouped and retrained for future offensives against the malaysian government eric stahl , '' doomed from the start : a new perspective on the malayan insurgency '' ( master 's thesis , 2003 ) during this time , the british administration was attempting to organise malaya 's economy , as revenue from malaya 's tin and rubber industries was important to britain 's own post-war recovery a major part of the strategy involved targeting the mnla food supply , which briggs recognised came from three main sources : camps within the malayan jungle where land was cleared to provide food , aboriginal jungle dwellers who could supply the mnla with food gathered within the jungle , and the mnla supporters within the 'squatter ' communities on the edge of the jungle ( origins of the fesr –

as a major factor in causing the malayan population to roundly reject the mnla campaign , and also as leading to widespread fear due to the perception that '' if even the high commissioner was no longer safe , there was little hope of protection and safety for the man-in-the-street in malaya during the malayan emergency , britain was the first nation to employ the use of herbicides and defoliants to destroy bushes , food crops , and trees to deprive the insurgents of cover and as part of the food denial campaign in the early 1950s the october resolutions , a response to the briggs plan , involved a change of tactics by the mpla by reducing attacks on economic targets and civilians , increasing efforts to go into political organisation and subversion , and bolstering the supply network from the min yuen as well as jungle farming an estimated 10,000 civilians and insurgents in malaya also suffered from the effects of the defoliant ( though many historians think the number is much larger , given that agent orange was used on a large scale in the malayan conflict and , unlike the us , the british government limited information about its use to avoid negative world public opinion ) in july 1957 , a few weeks before independence , the mcp made another attempt at peace talks , suggesting the following conditions for a negotiated peace : its members should be given privileges enjoyed by citizens a guarantee that political as well as armed members of the mcp would not be punished the failure of the talks affected mcp policy on 31 july 1960 the malayan government declared the state of emergency was over , and chin peng left south thailand for beijing where he was accommodated by the chinese authorities in the international liaison bureau , where many other southeast asian communist party leaders were housed however , after this strategy failed , the use of herbicides and defoliants in effort to fight the insurgents was restarted under the command of british general gerald templer in february 1953 , as a means of destroying food crops grown by communist forces in jungle clearings in the late 1960s , the coverage of the my lai massacre during the vietnam war prompted the initiation of investigations in the uk concerning alleged war crimes perpetrated by british forces during the emergency , such as the batang kali massacre the mnla began their war for malayan independence by targeting the colonial resource extraction industries , namely the tin mines and rubber plantations which were the main sources of income for the british occupation of malaya in 1948 the british replaced the malayan union with the federation of malaya which reduced chinese influence and for many chinese this appeared as a betrayal after their community had borne the

emergency british troops were often unable to tell the difference between enemy combatants and non-combatant civilians while conducting military operations through the jungles , due to the fact the guerrillas wore civilian clothing and had support from sympathetic civilian populations following the failure of the talks , tunku decided to withdraw the amnesty on 8 february 1956 , five months after it had been offered , stating that he would not be willing to meet the communists again unless they indicated beforehand their desire to see him with a view to making '' a complete surrender '' image : jungle service dress.jpg thumb upright 0.8 jungle service dress of the somerset light infantry used in the emergency the conflicts in malaya and vietnam have often been compared , with historians asking how a british force of 35,000 succeeded to quell a communist insurgency in malaya , while over half a million u.s the briggs plan was multifaceted but one aspect has become particularly well known : the forced relocation of some 500,000 rural malayans , including 400,000 chinese , from squatter communities on the fringes of the forests into guarded camps called '' new villages '' war crimes have been broadly defined by the nuremberg principles as '' violations of the laws or customs of war , '' which includes massacres , bombings of civilian targets , terrorism , mutilation , torture , and the murder of detainees and prisoners of war 211 and the people 's republic of china ( prc ) provided large amounts of the latest military hardware , logistical support , personnel and training to north vietnam , whereas the mnla received no material support , weapons or training from any foreign government or party britain did n't approach the emergency as a conventional conflict and quickly implemented an effective intelligence strategy , led by the malayan police special branch , and a systematic hearts and minds operation , both of which proved effective against the largely political aims of the guerrilla movement insurgents had numerous advantages over british forces ; they lived in closer proximity to villagers , they sometimes had relatives or close friends in the village , and they were not afraid to threaten violence or torture and murder village leaders as an example to the others , forcing them to assist them with food and information at all levels of the malayan government ( national , state , and district levels ) , the military and civil authority was assumed by a committee of military , police and civilian administration officials between 1956 and 1960 , the aircraft carriers and and destroyers , , , , , , , and were attached to the commonwealth strategic reserve forces for three to nine months at a time friendships on and off the battlefield developed between the two nations ; the first prime minister of malaysia , tunku abdul rahman , became a friend and mentor to ratu sir edward cakobau , who was a commander of the fijian battalion , and who later went on to become the deputy pm of fiji and whose son brigadier general ratu epeli was the former president of fiji the 2,4,5-t and 2,4-d ( agent orange ) were used to clear lines of communication and wipe out food crops as part of this strategy and in 1952 , trioxone , and mixtures of the aforementioned herbicides , were sent along a number of key roads thus there was a bond of trust between many malays and the british forces who had fought alongside them and overthrown the japanese occupiers , whereas no such bond or gratitude existed between the population of vietnam and either the french colonial authorities or , later , the americans the mnla was partly a re-formation of the malayan peoples ' anti-japanese army ( mpaja ) , the mcp-led guerrilla force which had been the principal resistance in malaya against the japanese occupation the central tenet of the briggs plan was that the best way to defeat an insurgency , such as the government was facing , was to cut the insurgents off from their supporters amongst the population in addition to british and malayan units and personnel , a range of commonwealth forces were also involved , including troops from australia , new zealand , fiji , kenya , nyasaland , and northern and southern rhodesia in a collaboration with australian academics , he met with historians and former commonwealth military personnel at a series of meetings which led to the publication of dialogues with chin peng : new light on the malayan communist party at the start of the emergency , the british had 13 infantry battalions in malaya , including seven partly formed gurkha battalions , three british battalions , two battalions of the royal malay regiment and a british royal artillery regiment being used as infantry the terms of the amnesty were : those of you who come in and surrender will not be prosecuted for any offence connected with the emergency , which you have committed under communist direction , either before this date or in ignorance of this declaration each of the malay states had a state war executive committee which included the state chief minister as chairman , the chief police officer , the senior military commander , state home guard officer , state financial officer , state information officer , executive secretary , and up to six selected community leaders in the early stages of the conflict , the guerrillas envisaged establishing control in '' liberated areas '' from which the government forces had been driven , but did not succeed in this chin ping walked out from the jungle and tried to negotiate with the leader of the federation , tunku abdul rahman , but the british intelligence service worried that the mcp would regain influence in society macgillivray to the secretary of state for the colonies , 15 march 1956 , co1030/22 despite the failure of the talks , the mcp made every effort to resume peace talks with the malayan government , without success in the '' batang kali massacre '' , 24 villagers were killed by 7th platoon , g company , 2nd scots guards , after they surrounded a rubber plantation at sungai rimoh near batang kali in selangor in december 1948 during templer 's two-year command , '' two-thirds of the guerrillas were wiped out and lost over half their strength , the incident rate fell from 500 to less than 100 per month and the civilian and security force casualties from 200 to less than 40 many malayans had fought side by side with the british against japanese occupation of malaya ( including , ironically , the head of the mpla , chin peng ) immediately after the war , the british authorities had set up the malayan union , a state where all citizens , malay , chinese and indian , would have equal rights officials explained that these measures were being imposed upon the 4,000 villagers '' for their continually supplying food '' to the insurgents and '' because they did not give information to the authorities '' '' later , mnla leader chin peng stated that the killing had little effect and that the communists were already altering their strategy , according to new guidelines enshrined in the so-called '' october resolutions '' '' civil-military operations : joint doctrine and the malayan emergency '' , joint force quarterly , autumn 2002 , paragraph 3,4 on 6 october 1951 , the british high commissioner in malaya , sir henry gurney , was assassinated ( see below ) the new conflict coincided with renewed tensions between ethnic malays and chinese following the 13 may incident of 1969 , and the ongoing conflict of the vietnam war on the military front , the security forces did not know how to fight an enemy moving freely in the jungle and enjoying support from the chinese rural population decapitation of suspected insurgents by british forces was also common practice as a way to identify dead guerrillas when it was not possible to bring their corpses in from the jungle as part of briggs ' plan devised by british general sir harold briggs , 500,000 people ( roughly ten percent of malaya 's population ) were eventually removed from the land these villages were newly constructed in most cases , and were surrounded by barbed wire , police posts , and floodlit areas , designed to keep the inhabitants in and the guerrillas out the mnla gained the support of the chinese because the chinese were denied the equal right to vote in elections , had no land rights to speak of , and were usually very poor brian lapping said that there was '' some vicious conduct by the british forces , who routinely beat up chinese squatting when they refused , or possibly were unable , to give information '' about the insurgents in purely military terms , the british army recognised that in a low-intensity war , the individual soldier 's skill and endurance were of far greater importance than overwhelming firepower ( artillery , air support , etc after the malayan conflict ended in 1960 , the us used the british precedent in deciding that the use of defoliants was a law of war there was a particular component of the chinese community referred to as 'squatters ' , farmers living on the edge of the jungles where the mnla were based in fact , the cpm had members from the malay , orang asli ( indigenous peoples ) and indian communities , although these were always in a minority the role of the special branch in the malayan emergency cited at length in vietnam war essay on insurgency and counterinsurgency lessons from malaya , ehistory , ohio state university the japanese occupation of malaya began in 1941 and from that point onwards the '' export of primary products was limited to the relatively small amounts required for the japanese economy imports of rice , which made up a large portion of the malayan diet , fell rapidly due to limited trade and thus the population was forced to focus their efforts on subsistence ) even though many british soldiers were conscripted national servicemen , the necessary skills and attitudes were taught at a jungle warfare school , which also developed the optimum tactics based on experience gained in the field the mnla attacked these industries in the hopes of bankrupting the british and winning independence by making the colonial administration too expensive to maintain
