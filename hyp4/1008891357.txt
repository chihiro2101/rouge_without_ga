a series of smaller pipes fed from the distribution pipe were pierced with a series of holes which pour water in the event of a fire casey cavanaugh grant , pe '' the birth of nfpa '' nfpa , 1996 '' until the 1940s , sprinklers were installed almost exclusively for the protection of commercial buildings , whose owners were generally able to recoup their expenses with savings in insurance costs over the years , fire sprinklers have become mandatory safety equipment '' in some parts of north america , in certain occupancy , including , but not limited to newly constructed '' hospitals , schools , hotels and other public buildings '' , subject to the local building codes and enforcement however , outside of the us and canada , sprinklers are rarely mandated by building codes for normal hazard occupancies which do not have large numbers of occupants ( e.g this is largely as a result of lobbying by the national fire sprinkler network , the european fire sprinkler network and the british automatic fire sprinkler association in scotland , all new schools are sprinkler protected , as are new care homes , sheltered housing and high rise flats sprinklers have been in use in the united states since 1874 , and were used in factory applications where fires at the turn of the century were often catastrophic in terms of both human and property losses in the us , sprinklers are today required in all new high rise and underground buildings generally above or below fire department access , where the ability of firefighters to provide adequate hose streams to fires is limited building codes in the united states for places of assembly , generally over 100 persons , and places with overnight sleeping accommodation such as hotels , nursing homes , dormitory , and hospitals usually require sprinklers either under local building codes , as a condition of receiving state and federal funding or as a requirement to obtain certification ( essential for institutions who wish to train medical staff ) most us building codes allow for less expensive construction materials , larger floor area limitations , longer egress paths , and fewer requirements for fire rated construction in structures protected by fire sprinklers consequently , the total building cost is often decreased by installing a sprinkler system and saving money in the other aspects of the project , as compared to building a non-sprinklered structure in the uk , since the 1990s sprinklers have gained recognition within the building regulations ( england and wales ) and scottish building standards and under certain circumstances , the presence of sprinkler systems is deemed to provide a form of alternative compliance to some parts of the codes for example , the presence of a sprinkler system will usually permit doubling of compartment sizes and increases in travel distances ( to fire exits ) as well as allowing a reduction in the fire rating of internal compartment walls other nordic countries require or soon will require sprinklers in new care homes , and in finland as of 2010 a third of care homes were retrofitted with sprinklers in addition , a sprinkler will usually activate within one to four minutes of the fire 's start , whereas it typically takes at least five minutes for a fire department to register an alarm and drive to the fire site , and an additional ten minutes to set up equipment and apply hose streams to the fire by a wide margin , wet pipe sprinkler systems are installed more often than all other types of fire sprinkler systems dry pipe systems are installed in spaces in which the ambient temperature may be cold enough to freeze the water in a wet pipe system , rendering the system inoperable dry pipe systems are most often used in unheated buildings , in parking garages , in outside canopies attached to heated buildings ( in which a wet pipe system would be provided ) , or in refrigerators sections 7-2 and a7-2 water is not present in the piping until the system operates ; instead , the piping is filled with air at a pressure below the water supply pressure to prevent the larger water supply pressure from prematurely forcing water into the piping , the design of the dry pipe valve ( a specialized type of check valve ) results in a greater force on top of the check valve clapper by the use of a larger valve clapper area exposed to the piping air pressure , as compared to the higher water pressure but smaller clapper surface area disadvantages of using dry pipe fire sprinkler systems include : if the sprinklers share the same standpipe system as the standpipe system which supplies fire hoses , then the water supply to the fire hoses would be severely reduced or even curtailed altogether increased fire response time : because the piping is empty at the time the sprinkler operates , there is an inherent time delay in delivering water to the sprinklers which have operated while the water travels from the riser to the sprinkler , partially filling the piping in the process the internal corrosion rate in wet pipe systems ( in which the piping is constantly full of water ) is much lower , as the amount of oxygen available for the corrosion process is lower nitrogen generators can be used as a permanent source of nitrogen gas , which is beneficial because dry pipe sprinkler systems require an uninterrupted supply of supervisory gas '' deluge '' systems are systems in which all sprinklers connected to the water piping system are open , in that the heat sensing operating element is removed , or specifically designed as such these systems are used for special hazards where rapid fire spread is a concern , as they provide a simultaneous application of water over the entire hazard to prevent the water supply pressure from forcing water into the piping , a '' deluge valve '' is used in the water supply connection , which is a mechanically latched valve in operation , the deluge system activates a fire alarm initiating device , or a manual pull station , signals the fire alarm panel , which in turn signals the deluge valve to open , allowing water to enter the piping system pre-action sprinkler systems are specialized for use in locations where accidental activation is especially undesirable , such as in museums with rare art works , manuscripts , or books ; and data centers , for protection of computer equipment from accidental water discharge the operation of single interlock systems are similar to dry systems except that these systems require that a '' preceding '' fire detection event , typically the activation of a heat or smoke detector , takes place prior to the '' action '' of water introduction into the system 's piping by opening the pre-action valve , which is a mechanically latched valve ( i.e prior to fire detection , if the sprinkler operates , or the piping system develops a leak , loss of air pressure in the piping will activate a trouble alarm these systems require that both a '' preceding '' fire detection event , typically the activation of a heat or smoke detector , and an automatic sprinkler operation take place prior to the '' action '' of water introduction into the system 's piping activation of either the fire detectors alone , or sprinklers alone , without the concurrent operation of the other , will not allow water to enter the piping because water does not enter the piping until a sprinkler operates , double interlock systems are considered as dry systems in terms of water delivery times , and similarly require a larger design area electronic sprinkler systems are systems comprising sprinklers in which the heat sensing operating element is replaced by electronic sensing and electronically triggered actuation a foam water fire sprinkler system is a special application system , discharging a mixture of water and low expansion foam concentrate , resulting in a foam spray from the sprinkler '' water spray '' systems are operationally identical to a deluge system , but the piping and discharge nozzle spray patterns are designed to protect a uniquely configured hazard , usually being three-dimensional components or equipment ( i.e suppression mode sprinklers ( formerly known as early suppression fast response ( esfr ) sprinklers ) are intended to result in a severe sudden reduction of the heat release rate of the fire , followed quickly by complete extinguishment , prior to manual intervention some tests have shown that the volume of water needed to extinguish a fire with such a system installed can be dramatically less than with a conventional sprinkler system nationwide in the united states , one and two-family homes generally do not require fire sprinkler systems , although the overwhelming loss of life due to fires occurs in these spaces the nfpa says the average loss per fire in buildings with sprinklers was 2,300 , compared to an average loss of 10,300 in unsprinklered buildings the nfpa states that it '' has no record of a fire killing more than two people in a completely sprinklered building where a sprinkler system was properly operating , except in an explosion or flash fire or where industrial fire brigade members or employees were killed during fire suppression operations
