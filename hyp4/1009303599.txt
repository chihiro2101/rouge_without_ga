the question of exploiting the noise of electromechanical encryption systems had been raised in the late 1940s , but was re-evaluated now as a possible threat nsa began developing techniques and specifications for isolating sensitive-communications pathways through filtering , shielding , grounding , and physical separation : of those lines that carried sensitive plain text â€“ from those intended to carry only non-sensitive data , the latter often extending outside of the secure environment six organizations , navy , army , air force , nsa , cia , and the state department were to provide the bulk of the effort for its implementation boak lectures , national security agency ( nsa ) , volumes i , 1973 , volumes ii 1981 , partially released 2008 , additional portions declassified october 14 , 2015 but then as now , security needs often met with resistance boak , '' some of what we still hear today in our own circles , when rigorous technical standards are whittled down in the interest of money and time , are frighteningly reminiscent of the arrogant third reich with their enigma cryptomachine current united states and nato tempest standards define three levels of protection requirements : nato sdip-27 level a ( formerly amsg 720b ) and usa nstissam level i : '' compromising emanations laboratory test standard '' : this is the strictest standard for devices that will be operated in nato zone 0 environments , where it is assumed that an attacker has almost immediate access ( e.g nato sdip-27 level b ( formerly amsg 788a ) and usa nstissam level ii : '' laboratory test standard for protected facility equipment '' : this is a slightly relaxed standard for devices that are operated in nato zone 1 environments , where it is assumed that an attacker can not get closer than about 20 metres ( 65 ' ) ( or where building materials ensure an attenuation equivalent to the free-space attenuation of this distance ) nato sdip-27 level c ( formerly amsg 784 ) and usa nstissam level iii : '' laboratory test standard for tactical mobile equipment/systems '' : an even more relaxed standard for devices operated in nato zone 2 environments , where attackers have to deal with the equivalent of 100 metres ( 300 ' ) of free-space attenuation ( or equivalent attenuation through building materials ) additional standards include : nato sdip-29 ( formerly amsg 719g ) : '' installation of electrical equipment for the processing of classified information '' : this standard defines installation requirements , for example in respect to grounding and cable distances amsg 799b : '' nato zoning procedures '' : defines an attenuation measurement procedure , according to which individual rooms within a security perimeter can be classified into zone 0 , zone 1 , zone 2 , or zone 3 , which then determines what shielding test standard is required for equipment that processes secret data in these rooms the nsa and department of defense have declassified some tempest elements after freedom of information act requests , but the documents black out many key values and descriptions the information-security agencies of several nato countries publish lists of accredited testing labs and of equipment that has passed these tests : in canada : canadian industrial tempest program in germany : bsi german zoned products list in the uk : uk cesg directory of infosec assured products , section 12 in the u.s : nsa tempest certification program the united states army also has a tempest testing facility , as part of the u.s tempest certification must apply to entire systems , not just to individual components , since connecting a single unshielded component ( such as a cable or device ) to an otherwise secure system could dramatically alter the system rf characteristics , maintaining distance or installing shielding between circuits and equipment used to handle plaintext classified or sensitive information that is not encrypted ( red ) and secured circuits and equipment ( black ) , the latter including those carrying encrypted signals in 1985 , wim van eck published the first unclassified technical analysis of the security risks of emanations from computer monitors this paper caused some consternation in the security community , which had previously believed that such monitoring was a highly sophisticated attack available only to governments ; van eck successfully eavesdropped on a real system , at a range of hundreds of metres , using just 15 worth of equipment plus a television set as a consequence of this research , such emanations are sometimes called '' van eck radiation '' , and the eavesdropping technique van eck phreaking , although government researchers were already aware of the danger , as bell labs noted this vulnerability to secure teleprinter communications during world war ii and was able to produce 75 % of the plaintext being processed in a secure facility from a distance of 80 feet ( 24 metres ) additionally the nsa published tempest fundamentals , nsa-82-89 , nacsim 5000 , national security agency ( classified ) on february 1 , 1982 usually , the technique of smothering the red signal with noise is not effective unless the power of the noise is sufficient to drive the eavesdropper 's receiver into saturation thus overwhelming the receiver input recent research has shown it is possible to detect the radiation corresponding to a keypress event from not only wireless ( radio ) keyboards , but also from traditional wired keyboards , and even from laptop keyboards from the 1970s onward , soviet bugging of us embassy ibm selectric typewriters allowed the keypress-derived mechanical motion of bails , with attached magnets , to be detected by implanted magnetometers , and converted via hidden electronics to a digital radio frequency signal in 2014 , researchers introduced '' airhopper '' , a bifurcated attack pattern showing the feasibility of data exfiltration from an isolated computer to a nearby mobile phone , using fm frequency signals the results of this architecture , often found in connected objects , is that the digital part of the chip will leak some metadata on its computations into the analog part , which leads to metadata 's leak being encoded in the noise of the radio transmission in the novel series the laundry files by charles stross , the character james angleton ( high ranking officer of an ultra-secret intelligence agency ) always uses low tech devices such as a typewriter or a memex to defend against tempest ( despite the building being tempest-shielded ) bitwhisper : the heat is on the air-gap how to leak sensitive data from an isolated computer ( air-gap ) to a near by mobile phone - airhopper nsa tempest endorsement program the complete , unofficial tempest information page ( original defunct
