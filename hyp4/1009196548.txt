for example , if a dose of a toxic substance is safe for a laboratory rat , one might assume that one-tenth that dose would be safe for a human , allowing a safety factor of 10 to allow for interspecies differences between two mammals ; if the data are from fish , one might use a factor of 100 to account for the greater difference between two chordate classes ( fish and mammals ) there are generally four types of toxic entities ; chemical , biological , physical and radiation : chemical toxicants include inorganic substances such as , lead , mercury , hydrofluoric acid , and chlorine gas , and organic compounds such as methanol , most medications , and toxins however , in a host with an intact immune system , the inherent toxicity of the organism is balanced by the host 's ability to fight back ; the effective toxicity is then a combination of both parts of the relationship while some weakly radioactive substances , such as uranium , are also chemical toxicants , more strongly radioactive materials like radium are not , their harmful effects ( radiation poisoning ) being caused by the ionizing radiation produced by the substance rather than chemical interactions with the substance itself the toxicity of substances can be observed by ( a ) studying the accidental exposures to a substance ( b ) in vitro studies using cells/ cell lines ( c ) in vivo exposure on experimental animals because individuals typically have different levels of response to the same dose of a toxic substance , a population-level measure of toxicity is often used which relates the probabilities of an outcome for a given individual in a population or , a newly synthesized and previously unstudied chemical that is believed to be very similar in effect to another compound could be assigned an additional protection factor of 10 to account for possible differences in effects that are probably much smaller even more complex are situations with more than one type of toxic entity , such as the discharge from a malfunctioning sewage treatment plant , with both chemical and biological agents obviously , this approach is very approximate ; but such protection factors are deliberately very conservative , and the method has been found to be useful in a deep variety of applications
