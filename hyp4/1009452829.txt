normally , on modern systems , the target of overclocking is increasing the performance of a major chip or subsystem , such as the main processor or graphics controller , but other components , such as system memory ( ram ) or system buses ( generally on the motherboard ) , are commonly involved the trade-offs are an increase in power consumption ( heat ) , fan noise ( cooling ) , and shortened lifespan for the targeted components overclocking techniques in general aim to trade this safety margin by setting the device to run in the higher end of the margin , with the understanding that temperature and voltage must be more strictly monitored and controlled by the user examples are that operating temperature would need to be more strictly controlled with increased cooling , as the part will be less tolerant of increased temperatures at the higher speeds also base operating voltage may be increased to compensate for unexpected voltage drops and to strengthen signalling and timing signals , as low-voltage excursions are more likely to cause malfunctions at higher operating speeds while in a pc context the usual result is a system crash , more subtle errors can go undetected , which over a long enough time can give unpleasant surprises such as data corruption ( incorrectly calculated results , or worse writing to storage incorrectly ) or the system failing only during certain specific tasks ( general usage such as internet browsing and word processing appear fine , but any application wanting advanced graphics crashes the system ) at this point an increase in operating voltage of a part may allow more headroom for further increases in clock speed , but the increased voltage can also significantly increase heat output , as well as shorten the lifespan further at some point there will be a limit imposed by the ability to supply the device with sufficient power , the user 's ability to cool the part , and the device 's own maximum voltage tolerance before it achieves destructive failure conversely , the primary goal of underclocking is to reduce power consumption and the resultant heat generation of a device , with the trade-offs being lower clock speeds and reductions in performance reducing the cooling requirements needed to keep hardware at a given operational temperature has knock-on benefits such as lowering the number and speed of fans to allow quiet pc , and in mobile devices increase the length of battery life per charge some manufacturers underclock components of battery-powered equipment to improve battery life , or implement systems that detect when a device is operating under battery power and reduce clock frequency underclocking and undervolting would be attempted on a desktop system to have it operate silently ( such as for a home entertainment center ) while potentially offering higher performance than currently offered by low-voltage processor offerings however again like overclocking there is no guarantee of success , and the builder 's time researching given system/processor combinations and especially the time and tedium of performing many iterations of stability testing need to be considered most modern processors derive their effective operating speeds by multiplying a base clock ( processor bus speed ) by an internal multiplier within the processor ( the cpu multiplier ) to attain their final speed computer processors generally are overclocked by manipulating the cpu multiplier if that option is available , but the processor and other components can also be overclocked by increasing the base speed of the bus clock some systems allow additional tuning of other clocks ( such as a clock rate ) that influence the bus clock speed that , again is multiplied by the processor to allow for finer adjustments of the final processor speed most oem systems do not expose to the user the adjustments needed to change processor clock speed or voltage in the bios of the oem 's motherboard , which precludes overclocking ( for warranty and support reasons ) components will generally show some sort of malfunctioning behavior or other indication of compromised stability that alerts the user that a given speed is not stable , but there is always a possibility that a component will permanently fail without warning , even if voltages are kept within some pre-determined safe values the end-point of a given overclock is determined by parameters such as available cpu multipliers , bus dividers , voltages ; the user 's ability to manage thermal loads , cooling techniques ; and several other factors of the individual devices themselves such as semiconductor clock and thermal tolerances , interaction with other components and the rest of the system first is to ensure that the component is supplied with adequate power at a voltage sufficient to operate at the new clock rate in a professional production environment , overclocking is only likely to be used where the increase in speed justifies the cost of the expert support required , the possibly reduced reliability , the consequent effect on maintenance contracts and warranties , and the higher power consumption voltage increases power consumption and consequently heat generation significantly ( proportionally to the square of the voltage in a linear circuit , for example ) ; this requires more cooling to avoid damaging the hardware by overheating in june 2006 , ibm and georgia institute of technology jointly announced a new record in silicon-based chip clock rate ( the rate a transistor can be switched at , not the cpu clock rate ) above 500 & nbsp ; ghz , which was done by cooling the chip to using liquid helium however , this practice is discouraged due to its safety risks ; the solvents are flammable and volatile , and dry ice can cause frostbite ( through contact with exposed skin ) and suffocation ( due to the large volume of carbon dioxide generated when it sublimes ) to further complicate matters , in process technologies such as silicon on insulator ( soi ) , devices display hysteresis & mdash ; a circuit 's performance is affected by the events of the past , so without carefully targeted tests it is possible for a particular sequence of state changes to work at overclocked rates in one situation but not another even if the voltage and temperature are the same the hope is that any functional-correctness issues with the overclocked component will show up during these tests , and if no errors are detected during the test , the component is then deemed '' stable '' an overclocker may report a score , noting that the benchmark only runs to completion 1 in 5 times , or that signs of incorrect execution such as display corruption are visible while running the benchmark ) apart from demanding applications such as video encoding , high-demand databases and scientific computing , memory bandwidth is typically not a bottleneck , so a great increase in memory bandwidth may be unnoticeable to a user depending on the applications used overclocking is sometimes offered as a legitimate service or feature for consumers , in which a manufacturer or retailer tests the overclocking capability of processors , memory , video cards , and other hardware products locking a chip 's clock multiplier does not necessarily prevent users from overclocking , as the speed of the front-side bus or pci multiplier ( on newer cpus ) may still be changed to provide a performance increase intel intended to block base clock ( bclk ) overclocking of locked processors when designing the skylake architecture to prevent consumers from purchasing cheaper components and overclocking to previously-unseen heights ( since the cpu 's bclk was no longer tied to the pci buses ) , however for lga1151 , the 6th generation '' skylake '' processors were able to be overclocked past 102.7 mhz ( which was the intended limit by intel , and was later mandated through later bios updates ) all other unlocked processors from lga1151 and v2 ( including 7th , 8th , and 9th generation ) and bga1440 allow for bclk overclocking ( as long as the oem allows it ) , while all other locked processors from 7th , 8th , and 9th gen were not able to go past 102.7 mhz on the bclk however , the memory performance is computed by dividing the processor clock rate ( which is a base number times a cpu multiplier , for instance 1.8 & nbsp ; ghz is most likely 9Ã—200 & nbsp ; mhz ) by a fixed integer such that , at a stock clock rate , the ram would run at a clock rate near 333 & nbsp ; mhz manipulating elements of how the processor clock rate is set ( usually adjusting the multiplier ) , it is often possible to overclock the processor a small amount , around 5-10 % , and gain a small increase in ram clock rate and/or reduction in ram latency timings when maximum cooling is not required , in any equipment , fan speeds can be reduced below the maximum : fan noise has been found to be roughly proportional to the fifth power of fan speed ; halving speed reduces noise by about 15 & nbsp ; db '' because installing windows is very memory-intensive , decoding errors may occur when files are extracted from the windows xp cd-rom the lifespan of semiconductor components may be reduced by increased voltages and heat if disk access or the speed of an internet connection limit the speed of a process , a 20 % increase in processor speed is unlikely to be noticed , however there are some scenarios where increasing the clock speed of a processor actually allows an ssd to be read and written to faster it is common to run into one of those problems when overclocking graphics cards ; both symptoms at the same time usually means that the card is severely pushed beyond its heat , clock rate , and/or voltage limits , however if seen when not overclocked , they indicate a faulty card flashing refers to using the firmware of a different card with the same ( or sometimes similar ) core and compatible firmware , effectively making it a higher model card ; it can be difficult , and may be irreversible for example , video cards with 3d accelerators ( most , have two voltage and clock rate settings , one for 2d and one for 3d , but were designed to operate with three voltage stages , the third being somewhere between the aforementioned two , serving as a fallback when the card overheats or as a middle-stage when going from 2d to 3d operation mode therefore , it could be wise to set this middle-stage prior to '' serious '' overclocking , specifically because of this fallback ability ; the card can drop down to this clock rate , reducing by a few ( or sometimes a few dozen , depending on the setting ) percent of its efficiency and cool down , without dropping out of 3d mode ( and afterwards return to the desired high performance clock and voltage settings ) while these models have either 8 or 12 pipes enabled , they share the same 16x6 gpu core as a 6800gt or ultra , but pipelines and shaders beyond those specified are disabled ; the gpu may be fully functional , or may have been found to have faults which do not affect operation at the lower specification
