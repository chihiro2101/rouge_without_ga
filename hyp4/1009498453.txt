as a result , for the cost of reaching the earth–sun point , which is rather low energy value , one can travel to a number of very interesting points for a little or no additional fuel cost the itn is based around a series of orbital paths predicted by chaos theory and the restricted three-body problem leading to and from the orbits around the lagrange points – points in space where the gravity between various bodies balances with the centrifugal force of an object there ross capture dynamics and chaotic motions in celestial mechanics : with the construction of low energy transfers - a mathematical analysis of aspects of the itn , edward belbruno ( 2004 ) the dynamical mechanism of ballistic lunar capture transfers in the four-body problem from the perspective of invariant manifolds and hill 's regions by edward belbruno dynamical systems , the three-body problem , and space mission design , by wang sang koon , martin lo , jerrold e nevertheless , they have already been used to transfer spacecraft to the earth–sun point , a useful point for studying the sun that was employed in a number of recent missions , including the genesis mission , the first to return solar wind samples to earth another example of the use of the itn was nasa 's 2001–2003 genesis mission , which orbited the sun–earth point for over two years collecting material , before being redirected to the lagrange point , and finally redirected from there back to earth he noticed that the paths leading to and from any of those points would almost always settle , for a time , on an orbit about that point this turned out to be useful , as many of these paths lead to some interesting points in space , such as the earth 's moon or between the galilean moons of jupiter for instance , the earth–moon point lies on a line between the two , where gravitational forces between them exactly balance with the centrifugal force of an object placed in orbit there in addition to orbits around lagrange points , the rich dynamics that arise from the gravitational pull of more than one mass yield interesting trajectories , also known as low energy transfers in a more recent example , the chinese spacecraft chang ' e 2 used the itn to travel from lunar orbit to the earth-sun point , then on to fly by the asteroid 4179 toutatis however , a small number of exact solutions exist , most notably the five orbits referred to as '' lagrange points '' , which are orbital solutions for circular orbits in the case when one body is significantly more massive for any two bodies in which one body orbits around the other , such as a star/planet or planet/moon system , there are five such points , denoted through there are in fact an infinite number of paths taking one to the point and away from it , and all of which require nearly zero change in energy to reach
