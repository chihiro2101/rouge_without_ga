the treaty of paris was signed on 30 march 1856 at the congress of paris with russia on one side of the negotiating table and france , britain , the ottoman empire and the kingdom of sardinia on the other side the treaty came about to resolve the crimean war , which had begun on 23 october 1853 , when the ottoman empire formally declared war on russia after it moved troops into the danubian principalities the western european alliance powers pledged to maintain the integrity of the ottoman empire and restored the respective territories of the russian and the ottoman empires to their pre-war boundaries even amongst the allies , disagreements between nations concerning the nature of the treaty created an uncertain peace , resulting in further diplomatic issues involving the ottoman empire , especially in terms of its relations with the russian empire and the concert of europe russian aims despite losing the war , the russians wanted to ensure that they attained the best possible outcome for the empire at the congress of paris there were problems throughout the empire , stretching from parts of finland to poland and crimea and many tribal conflicts , and the russian economy was on the brink of collapse peace talks were pursued by alexander ii with britain and france in paris in 1856 as a means of attempting to keep some imperial possession , but also of stopping the deaths of thousands of its army reserves as well as preventing an economic crisis the british were increasingly wary throughout the war that the french might capitalise on a weakened russia and focus their attention on seeking revenge on the british for french military defeats at trafalgar and waterloo although there was a call for the end of the war in britain , including riots in london , there was support for its continuation , and expansion to punish russia 's imperial ambition , particularly from the incumbent prime minister lord palmerston britain and france desired to ensure that the ottoman empire were made stronger by the treaty of paris , ensuring a stable balance of power in europe britain and france hoped that peace and restricting russian access to key areas , such as the black sea , would allow the ottoman empire to focus on internal issues including rising nationalism in many nations under the empire 's authority without the ottomans being in full control of their empire , the great powers feared that it could lose much of its territory in future wars with the russian empire and the german confederation , eventually strengthening these nations that could pose a significant threat to the french and british 27–33 thus , the full removal of russian presence in the danubian provinces and the black sea served both to protect british dominance and to inhibit the russian empire from expanding its influence so readily russia had to return to moldavia part of its territory it had annexed in 1812 ( to the mouth of the danube , in southern bessarabia ) image : treaty of paris 1856 - 1.jpg treaty of paris : debates image : crimea_treaty_of_paris_medallion_war_peace_medallion_1856.jpg a medallion issued to celebrate the end of the crimean war and the treaty of paris , made from a soft , '' silver colour '' alloy the treaty reopened the black sea for international trade to be safe and effectual after both the naval warfare of the crimean war and the presence of russian warships had made trade difficult , including many trade disputes the treaty of paris was influenced by the general public in france and britain because the crimean war , was one of the first wars in which the general public received relatively prompt media coverage of the events the importance of the ottoman empire to britain and france in maintaining the balance of power in the black and the mediterranean seas made many view the signing of the treaty of paris to be the entrance of the ottoman empire to the european international theatre greater penetration of european influence into ottoman international law and a decline in emphasis of islamic practices in their legal system illustrate more of an inclusion of the ottoman empire into european politics and disputes , leading to its major role in the first world war palabiyik , mustafa serdar , the emergence of the idea of ‘ internationallaw ’ in the ottoman empire before the treaty of paris ( 1856 ) , middle eastern studies , 50:2 , 2014 , 233-251 russia , the gendarme of conservatism and the saviour of austria during the hungarian revolution of 1848 , angrily resented the failure of austria to help or assist its former ally , which contributed to russia 's non-intervention in the 1859 franco-austrian war , which meant the end of austrian influence in italy ; in the 1866 austro-prussian war , with the loss of its influence in most german-speaking land ; and in the ausgleich ( compromise ) with hungary of 1867 , which meant the sharing of the power in the danubian empire with the magyars
