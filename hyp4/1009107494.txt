there are three kinds of evoked potentials in widespread clinical use : auditory evoked potentials , usually recorded from the scalp but originating at brainstem level ; visual evoked potentials , and somatosensory evoked potentials , which are elicited by electrical stimulation of peripheral nerve in the peripheral nervous system pain and heat signals are carried along thin ( c and a delta ) fibers to the spinal cord , and leps can be used to determine whether a neuropathy is located in these small fibers as opposed to larger ( touch , vibration ) fibers erps are brain responses that are time-locked to some '' event '' , such as a sensory stimulus , a mental event ( such as recognition of a target stimulus ) , or the omission of a stimulus by using zoom-fft to record sseps at the theoretical limit of spectral resolution δf ( where δf in hz is the reciprocal of the recording duration in seconds ) regan and regan discovered that the amplitude and phase variability of the ssep can be sufficiently small that the bandwidth of the ssep 's constituent frequency components can be at the theoretical limit of spectral resolution up to at least a 500-second recording duration ( 0.002 & nbsp ; hz in this case ) sensory evoked potentials ( sep ) are recorded from the central nervous system following stimulation of sense organs , for example , visual evoked potentials elicited by a flashing light or changing pattern on a monitor , o'shea , r auditory evoked potentials by a click or tone stimulus presented through earphones ) , or tactile or somatosensory evoked potential ( ssep ) elicited by tactile or electrical stimulation of a sensory or mixed nerve in the periphery visual evoked potential ( vep ) is an evoked potential elicited by presenting light flash or pattern stimulus which can be used to confirm damage to visual pathway including retina , optic nerve , optic chiasm , optic radiations , and occipital cortex by analogy with the steady-state response of a resonant circuit that follows the initial transient response he defined an idealized steady-state evoked potential ( ssep ) as a form of response to repetitive sensory stimulation in which the constituent frequency components of the response remain constant with time in both amplitude and phase because of the low amplitude of the signal once it reaches the patient 's scalp and the relatively high amount of electrical noise caused by background eeg , scalp muscle emg or electrical devices in the room , the signal must be averaged a plot of , for example , response amplitude versus the check size of a stimulus checkerboard pattern plot can be obtained in 10 seconds , far faster than when time-domain averaging is used to record an evoked potential for each of several check sizes the evoked potential is generated in the cochlea , goes through the cochlear nerve , through the cochlear nucleus , superior olivary complex , lateral lemniscus , to the inferior colliculus in the midbrain , on to the medial geniculate body , and finally to the cortex for example , the properties of the high-frequency flicker ssep ( whose peak amplitude is near 40–50 & nbsp ; hz ) correspond to the properties of the subsequently discovered magnocellular neurons in the retina of the macaque monkey , while the properties of the medium-frequency flicker ssep ( whose amplitude peak is near 15–20 & nbsp ; hz ) correspond to the properties of parvocellular neurons aeps ( and erps ) are very small electrical voltage potentials originating from the brain recorded from the scalp in response to an auditory stimulus , such as different tones , speech sounds , etc since the ventral and dorsal spinal cord have separate blood supply with very limited collateral flow , an anterior cord syndrome ( paralysis or paresis with some preserved sensory function ) is a possible surgical sequela , so it is important to have monitoring specific to the motor tracts as well as dorsal column monitoring tcmep , whether electrical or magnetic , is the most practical way to ensure pure motor responses , since stimulation of sensory cortex can not result in descending impulses beyond the first synapse ( synapses can not be backfired ) during the 1990s , there were attempts to monitor '' motor evoked potentials '' , including '' neurogenic motor evoked potentials '' recorded from peripheral nerves , following direct electrical stimulation of the spinal cord vep may be abnormal in optic neuritis , optic neuropathy , demyelinating disease , multiple sclerosis , friedreich ’ s ataxia , vitamin b12 deficiency , neurosyphilis , migraine , ischemic disease , tumor compressing the optic nerve , ocular hypertension , glaucoma , diabetes , toxic amblyopia , aluminum neurotoxicity , manganism , retrobulbar neuritis , and brain injury although this definition implies a series of identical temporal waveforms , it is more helpful to define the ssep in terms of the frequency components that are an alternative description of the time-domain waveform , because different frequency components can have quite different properties some specific veps are : monocular pattern reversal ( most common ) sweep visual evoked potential binocular visual evoked potential chromatic visual evoked potential hemi-field visual evoked potential flash visual evoked potential led goggle visual evoked potential motion visual evoked potential multifocal visual evoked potential multi-channel visual evoked potential multi-frequency visual evoked potential stereo-elicited visual evoked potential steady state visually evoked potential the existence of a ( 2fv + 2fa ) component in the evoked magnetic brain response demonstrated an audio-visual convergence area in the human brain , and the distribution of this response over the head allowed this brain area to be localized in the central nervous system they can detect damage to the spinothalamic tract , lateral brain stem , and fibers carrying pain and temperature signals from the thalamus to the cortex during that same year , hirsch and colleagues recorded a visual evoked potential ( vep ) on the occipital lobe ( externally and internally ) , and they discovered amplitudes recorded along the calcarine fissure were the largest they have emphasized that , in diagnosing abnormal visual development , the more precise the developmental norms , the more sharply can the abnormal be distinguished from the normal , and to that end have documented normal visual development in a large group of infants motor evoked potentials ( mep ) are recorded from muscles following direct stimulation of exposed motor cortex , or transcranial stimulation of motor cortex , either magnetic or electrical it has become clear that these '' motor '' potentials were almost entirely elicited by antidromic stimulation of sensory tracts—even when the recording was from muscles ( antidromic sensory tract stimulation triggers myogenic responses through synapses at the root entry level ) because of the high-frequency rolloff of the ssep , high frequency stimulation can produce a near-sinusoidal ssep waveform , but this is not germane to the definition of a ssep in addition , meps are used as a reference to adjust the intensity of stimulation that needs to be delivered by tms when targeting cortical regions whose response might not be as easily measurable , e.g for example , the running average of the ssep can be arranged to increase the luminance of a checkerboard stimulus if the amplitude of the ssep falls below some predetermined value , and to decrease luminance if it rises above this value for example , when two unpatterned lights are modulated at slightly different frequencies ( f1 and f2 ) and superimposed , multiple nonlinear cross-modulation components of frequency ( mf1 ± nf2 ) are created in the ssep , where m and n are integers they are recorded by stimulating peripheral nerves , most commonly the tibial nerve , median nerve or ulnar nerve , typically with an electrical stimulus
