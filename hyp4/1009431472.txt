in 1768 , he was elected to the house of commons for preston , and for the next few years he occupied himself chiefly with his parliamentary duties , in which he was remarkable for his general outspokenness and , in particular , for his attacks on lord clive , who was at the time considered the nation 's leading soldier the plan , largely of his own creation , was for burgoyne and his force to cross lake champlain from quebec and capture ticonderoga before advancing on albany , new york , where they would rendezvous with another british army under general howe coming north from new york city , and a smaller force that would come down the mohawk river valley under barry st burgoyne gained possession of the vital outposts of fort ticonderoga ( for which he was made a lieutenant-general ) and fort edward , but , pushing on , decided to break his communications with quebec , and was eventually hemmed in by a superior force led by american major general horatio gates this was the greatest victory the american forces had up to that point in the revolutionary war , and it proved to be the turning point in the war , as france entered into an alliance with the american patriots 151 accounts of the lavish lifestyle he maintained on the saratoga campaign , combined with a gentlemanly bearing and his career as a playwright led less-than-friendly contemporaries to caricature him , as historian george billias writes , '' a buffoon in uniform who bungled his assignments badly '' having amassed an army of over 7,000 troops in quebec , burgoyne was also led to believe by reports that he could rely on the support of large numbers of native americans and american loyalists who would rally to the flag once the british came south on the outbreak of the american war , he was appointed to a command , and arrived in boston in may 1775 , a few weeks after the first shots of the war had been fired however , lord germain 's orders dispatched from london were not clear on this point , with the effect that howe took no action to support burgoyne , and clinton moved from new york too late and in too little strength to be any great help to burgoyne in 1761 , he sat in parliament for midhurst , and in the following year he served as a brigadier-general in portugal which had just entered the war he participated as part of the garrison during the siege of boston , although he did not see action at the battle of bunker hill , in which the british forces were led by william howe and henry clinton germain had overseen the overall strategy for the campaign and had significantly neglected to order general howe to support burgoyne 's invasion , instead leaving him to believe that he was free to launch his own attack on philadelphia carleton then led the british forces onto lake champlain , but was , in burgoyne 's opinion , insufficiently bold when he failed to attempt the capture of fort ticonderoga after winning the naval battle of valcour island in october at the same time , he devoted much attention to art and drama ( his first play , the maid of the oaks , was produced by david garrick in 1775 ) although burgoyne at the time was widely held to blame for the defeat , historians have over the years shifted responsibility for the disaster at saratoga to lord germain , the secretary of state for the colonies despite this , accounts of those that served under him , particularly that of corporal roger lamb , noted that burgoyne 'shunned no danger ; his presence and conduct animated the troops ( for they greatly loved their general ) ' in 1776 , he was at the head of the british reinforcements that sailed up the saint lawrence river and relieved quebec city , which was under siege by the continental army in 1782 when his political friends came into office , burgoyne was restored to his rank , given the colonelcy of the king 's own royal regiment , made commander-in-chief in ireland and appointed a privy councillor from the age of 10 , burgoyne attended the prestigious westminster school , as did many british army officers of the time such as thomas gage with whom burgoyne would later serve underlining the plan was the belief that burgoyne 's aggressive thrust from quebec would be aided by the movements of two other large british forces under generals howe and clinton , who would support the advance the following year , having convinced king george iii and his government of carleton 's faults , burgoyne was given command of the british forces charged with gaining control of lake champlain and the hudson river valley he returned at once , with the leave of the american general , to defend his conduct and demanded but never obtained a trial frustrated by the lack of opportunities , he returned to england long before the rest of the garrison , which evacuated the city in march 1776
