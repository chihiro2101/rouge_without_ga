all the structural genes of an operon are turned on or off together , due to a single promoter and operator upstream to them , but sometimes more control over the gene expression is needed operons are related to regulons , stimulons and modulons ; whereas operons contain a set of genes regulated by the same operator , regulons contain a set of genes under regulation by a single regulatory protein , and stimulons contain a set of genes under regulation by a single cell stimulus an operon contains one or more structural genes which are generally transcribed into one polycistronic mrna ( a single mrna molecule that codes for more than one protein ) in the lac operon , lactose binds to the repressor protein and prevents it from repressing gene transcription , while in the trp operon , tryptophan binds to the repressor protein and enables it to repress gene transcription it also contains a promoter which binds to rna polymerase and an operator which blocks transcription when bound to the protein synthesized by the repressor gene ( trp r ) that binds to the operator the main operator ( o1 ) in the lac operon is located slightly downstream of the promoter ; two additional operators , o1 and o3 are located at -82 and +412 , respectively not always included within the operon , but important in its function is a regulatory gene , a constantly expressed gene which codes for repressor proteins this theory suggested that in all cases , genes within an operon are negatively controlled by a repressor acting at a single operator located before the first gene to achieve this aspect , some bacterial genes are located near together , but there is a specific promoter for each of them ; this is called gene clustering 5 the regulators of a given operon , including repressors , corepressors , and activators , are not necessarily coded for by that operon control of an operon is a type of gene regulation that enables organisms to regulate the expression of various genes depending on environmental conditions the trp operon , involved in the synthesis of tryptophan ( which itself acts as the corepressor ) , is a negatively controlled repressible operon in negative inducible operons , a regulatory repressor protein is normally bound to the operator , which prevents the transcription of the genes on the operon today , the operon is simply defined as a cluster of genes transcribed into a single mrna molecule it is classically defined in the lac operon as a segment between the promoter and the genes of the operon the regulatory gene does not need to be in , adjacent to , or even near the operon to control it however , the definition of an operon does not require the mrna to be polycistronic , though in practice , it usually is
