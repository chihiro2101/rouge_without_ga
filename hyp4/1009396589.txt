in the process of individuation , wherein knowledge as such emerges , there are individuations of mnemo-technological subsystems which overdetermine , qua specific organizations of what stiegler calls tertiary retentions , the organization , transmission , and elaboration of knowledge stemming from the experience of the sensible . '' in general , it is the process by which individual beings are formed and differentiated from other human beings ; in particular , it is the development of the psychological individual as a being distinct from the general , collective psychology in addition to complex ( psychology ) , his theory of the individuation process forms conceptions of an unconscious filled with mythic images , a non-sexual libido , the general types of extraversion and introversion , the compensatory and prospective functions of dreams , and the synthetic and constructive approaches to fantasy formation and utilization in analytical psychology , individuation is the process where the individual self develops out of an undifferentiated unconscious – seen as a developmental psychic process during which innate elements of personality , the components of the immature psyche , and the experiences of the person 's life become , if the process is more or less successful , integrated over time into a well-functioning whole the philosophy of bernard stiegler draws upon and modifies the work of gilbert simondon on individuation and also upon similar ideas in friedrich nietzsche and sigmund freud in l'individuation psychique et collective , gilbert simondon developed a theory of individual and collective individuation in which the individual subject is considered as an effect of individuation rather than a cause these retentional apparatuses arise from a technical system which is the condition of the encounter of the i and the we — the individuation of the i and the we is in this respect also the individuation of the technical system from around 2016 , coinciding with increased government regulation of the collection and handling of personal data , most notably the gdpr in eu law , individuation has been used to describe the ‘ singling out ’ of a person from a crowd – a threat to privacy , autonomy and dignity the individuation of the i is always inscribed in that of the we , whereas the individuation of the we takes place only through the individuations , polemical in nature , of the i & nbsp ; ’ s which constitute it doing so enables the person , at an individual level , to be tracked , profiled , targeted , contacted , or subject to a decision or action which impacts them - even if their ‘ identity ’ is not known ( or knowable ) and these retentional apparatuses are the basis for the dispositions between the individuation of the i and the individuation of the we in a single process of psychic , collective , and technical individuation composed of three branches , each branching out into process groups in his view , the mere difference in location suffices to make two systems different , with each of the two states having its own real physical state , independent of the state of the other the essential points are the following : the i , as a psychic individual , can only be thought in relationship to we , which is a collective individual this process of triple individuation is itself inscribed within a vital individuation which must be apprehended as the vital individuation of natural organs , the technological individuation of artificial organs , and the psycho-social individuation of organizations linking them together
