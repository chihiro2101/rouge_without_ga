at that time , a system could store digitized speech on disk , play the appropriate spoken message , and process the human 's dtmf response as call centers began to migrate to multimedia in the late 1990s , companies started to invest in computer telephony integration ( cti ) with ivr systems with improvements in technology , systems could use speaker-independent voice recognition of a limited vocabulary instead of requiring the person to use dtmf signaling an ivr can be deployed in several ways : equipment installed on the customer premises equipment installed in the pstn ( public switched telephone network ) application service provider ( asp ) / hosted ivr an automatic call distributor ( acd ) is often the first point of contact when calling many larger businesses this information can be used to profile the caller and route the call to an agent with a particular skill set ) interactive voice response can be used to front-end a call center operation by identifying the needs of the caller a traditional ivr depended upon proprietary programming or scripting languages , whereas modern ivr applications are generated in a similar way to web pages , using standards such as voicexml , ccxml , srgs and ssml the ability to use xml-driven applications allows a web server to act as the application server , freeing the ivr developer to focus on the call flow ivr speech recognition interactions ( call flows ) are designed using 3 approaches to prompt for and recognize user input : directed , open-ended , and mixed dialogue the key difference is that with directed dialogue , the user is more likely to speak an option exactly as was communicated by the prompt ( e.g mixed dialog prompts must also be able to recognize responses that are not relevant to the immediate prompt , for instance in the case of a user deciding to shift to a function different from the current one in telecommunications , an audio response unit ( aru ) is a device that provides synthesized voice responses to dtmf keypresses by processing calls based on ( a ) the call-originator input , ( b ) information received from a database , and ( c ) information in the incoming call , such as the time of day in a system wherein individual customers may have a different status , the service will automatically prioritize the individual 's call and move customers to the front of a specific queue cti can transfer relevant information about the individual customer and the ivr dialog from the ivr to the agent desktop using a screen pop , making for a more effective and efficient service voice-activated dialing ( vad ) ivr systems are used to automate routine inquiries to a switchboard or pabx ( private automatic branch exchange ) operators , and are used in many hospitals and large businesses to reduce the caller waiting time this is information that could easily be handled by a person but the ivr system is used to preserve privacy and avoid potential embarrassment of sensitive information or test results ivr may also be used by survey organizations to ask more sensitive questions where the investigators are concerned that a respondent might feel less comfortable providing these answers to a human interlocutor ( such as questions about drug use or sexual behavior ) mobile vaani is a product of this company which connects to hard to reach in northern india with development messages , employment alerts , entrepreneurial activities , and also conduct market research studies with the introduction of sip contact centers , call control in a sip contact center can be implemented by ccxml scripting , which is an adjunct to the vxml language used to generate modern ivr dialogues as calls are queued in the sip contact center , the ivr system can provide treatment or automation , wait for a fixed period , or play music inbound calls to a sip contact center must be queued or terminated against a sip end point ; sip ivr systems can be used to replace agents directly by the use of applications deployed using bbua ( back-to-back user agents ) it is also possible to deploy two-prong ivr services where the initial ivr application is used to route the call to the appropriate contact center ivr has historically received criticism for its difficulty of use and a lack of appreciation of the caller 's needs as well as objections to providing a voice response to an automated system additionally , as basic information is now available online , the calls coming into a call center are more likely to be complex problems and not ones that can be resolved in an automated fashion , thus requiring the attention of a live agent .
