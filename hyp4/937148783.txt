as the data bus was effectively reduced to 32-bit width , per-clock performance was much lower than that of a 'regular ' pentium , though still substantially faster compared to a similarly-clocked 486 owing to the pentium 's architectural improvements , such as the much improved fpu for instance , the packard bell 450 motherboard required a specially-designed interposer to be installed between the processor and the motherboard to cope with the changed specification , with the unfortunate consequence of precluding access to the motherboard 's level 2 cache , resulting in sub-par performance however , the majority of socket 3 motherboards , particularly later ( post-1994 ) vlb and most pci boards , provide proper support for the pentium overdrive including fully operational access to the level 2 cache , and many earlier boards also support the processor with varying levels of compatibility and performance in addition , it fully supported programs and operating systems specifically coded for the pentium architecture , such as many emulators , multimedia utilities and even later windows operating systems and games ; however , the benefit of running such programs on a clock- and motherboard bus-constrained system may be questionable although little known , intel did in fact release an overdrive chip for these sockets , that used an internal clock multiplier of 2 , to change them to a '' 120/133 '' machine in 1998 the pentium ii overdrive , part number podp66x333 , was released as an upgrade path for pentium pro owners though it was based on the deschutes core , when queried by the cpuid command , it identified as a klamath pentium ii , wayback machine archive of heise , accessed april 12 , 2009 as noted in the pentium ii processor update documentation from intel , '' please note that although this processor has a cpuid of 163xh , it uses a pentium ii processor cpuid 065xh processor core
