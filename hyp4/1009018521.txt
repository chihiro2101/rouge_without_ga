barlow '' st calais , william of '' oxford dictionary of national biography his mother 's name , ascelina or anselma , is given in durham 's records ; his father , whose name is unknown , became a monk at the monastery of saint-calais in maine , and may previously have been a knight 288 st-calais studied under odo , bishop of bayeux , the half-brother of the future william i of england , who was then duke of normandy he became a benedictine monk at saint-calais in maine , where his father had become a monk , and soon became the prior of that house as abbot , his only appearance in historical records is his upholding of the monasteries ' right to some property , and his acceptance of a gift of property in the town 241 greenway fasti ecclesiae anglicanae 1066–1300 : volume 2 : monastic cathedrals ( northern and southern provinces ) : durham : bishops his elevation may have been a reward for diplomatic services he rendered to the king in france , barlow english church p the chronicler symeon of durham asserted that when st-calais was consecrated bishop by archbishop thomas of york , he managed to avoid professing obedience to the archbishop , which , if true , would have freed st-calais from interference in his diocese 39 after his appointment , st-calais decided to replace his cathedral chapter of clergy with monks , and consulted the king and lanfranc , the archbishop of canterbury , before going to rome to receive permission from pope gregory vii this community had been founded at jarrow by reinfrid , a norman ex-knight and monk of evesham abbey , and eadwine , an english monk from winchcombe abbey st-calais enjoyed good relations with his cathedral chapter , and they supported him when construction began on a new church in 1093 while it is often difficult to determine who was considered most important on a charter 's witness list , placement near the top of the list is usually understood to mean that the signatory was considered important 130 st-calais also served as a commissioner in the south-western part of england for the domesday book , which aimed to survey the whole of england and record who owned the lands 68–70 pierre chaplais , who argues for st-calais being the main organizer of the survey , argues the bishop 's exile in 1088 interrupted work on the little domesday book , a subproject of the survey which was left uncompleted soon after the accession of william rufus , st-calais became one of the king 's most trusted lieutenants , mason william ii pp 152–153 around easter 1088 , odo of bayeux and many of the nobles revolted against the king and tried to place the king 's elder brother robert curthose , duke of normandy , on the throne st-calais was the only bishop who did not actively aid the king ; the rebelling magnates included roger de montgomery earl of shrewsbury , robert de mowbray earl of northumbria , and odo 's brother robert count of mortain when the king 's army arrived , st-calais agreed to come out , but only after receiving a safe conduct that would allow him to attend a trial while his men continued to hold the castle st-calais was brought before the king and royal court for trial on 2 november 1088 , at salisbury , barlow william rufus p lanfranc presented the king 's case , declaring that the confiscated lands had been held as fiefs , and thus st-calais could be tried as a vassal , not as a bishop lending support to their belief is the fact that st-calais never pursued his appeal to rome , and that later , in 1095 , he took the side of the king against anselm of canterbury when anselm tried to assert a right to appeal to rome during the course of the trial , lanfranc is said to have stated that the court was '' trying you not in your capacity as bishop , but in regard to your fief ; and in this way we judged the bishop of bayeux in regard to his fief before the present king 's father , and that king did not summon him to that plea as bishop but as brother and earl 285–286 the final judgement was only reached after the king lost his temper and exclaimed : '' believe me , bishop , you 're not going back to durham , and your men are n't going to stay at durham , and you 're not going to go free , until you release the castle 135 the extant de iniusta vexacione willelmi episcopi primi , or of the unjust persecution of the bishop william i , aird '' absent friend '' anglo-norman durham p this work is the earliest surviving detailed contemporary report of an english state-trial ; some have doubted its authenticity , however , claiming st-calais would not have been as knowledgeable in canon law as the work portrays him the historian mark philpott , however , argues that st-calais was knowledgeable in canon law , since he owned a copy of the canon law , the pseudo-isidore , which still survives once the castle was back under the king 's control , st-calais was released , and exiled ; he left for normandy , and no more was heard of his appeal to rome 108 footnote 1 duke robert had persuaded the king to allow bishop william 's return , perhaps in recognition of a service st-calais performed for the king by brokering the end of a siege in normandy that the king 's forces were about to lose 71 it was st-calais , along with robert , count of meulan who negotiated with anselm , the abbot of bec , in 1093 over the conditions under which anselm would allow himself to be elected archbishop of canterbury 306 st-calais managed the king 's case against anselm at rockingham in 1095 , when anselm wished to go to receive his pallium from pope urban ii 52 at that time st-calais opposed anselm 's attempt to appeal to rome over the issue , and steadfastly maintained the king 's position against anselm , even advocating that the archbishop be deprived of his lands and sent into exile 182–185 later , when the king was negotiating with walter of albano , the papal legate sent by urban to convey the pallium to anselm and to secure the king 's recognition of urban as pope , st-calais was the king 's chief negotiator 92 the clerical reformers , eadmer among them , who supported anselm in these quarrels , later tried to claim that st-calais had supported the king out of a desire to succeed anselm as archbishop if anselm was deposed , but it is unlikely that st-calais seriously believed that anselm would be deposed durham 's location in the north left it insecure , as malcolm canmore , king of scots , raided and invaded the north of england on a number of occasions both the english king and st-calais did all in their power to support malcolm 's sons , who had been educated in england , in their attempts to secure the scottish throne later , in 1095 , an english noble , robert de mowbray , who was earl of northumbria , challenged the bishop 's authority in the north thus , when a non-monk was selected to replace st-calais , the monks began a long struggle to secure what they felt had been promised to them , including the forging of charters ascribed to st-calais that supported their case 111–124 st-calais also ordered the destruction of the old cathedral that had been built by aldhun , to make way for the construction of a new , larger cathedral , the current romanesque-style durham cathedral 36 the construction of the new cathedral began on 29 july 1093 , when st-calais led his cathedral chapter in dedicating the site 283 however , st-calais ' exile after his trial as well as his employment in the royal service meant that he was often absent from his bishopric , and this probably is the cause of the medieval chronicler symeon of durham 's comparatively neutral treatment of st-calais in his works st-calais appears to have been a devotee of the cult , and the most likely date for the creation of the confraternity link between the two houses is during st-calais ' time as bishop shortly before christmas 1095 , one of st-calais ' knights , boso , fell ill and dreamed he was transported to the afterlife , where he found a large house with gates made of iron other works that st-calais gave to the cathedral library were copies of augustine of hippo 's de civitae dei and confessions ; gregory the great 's pastoral care , moralia , and homilies ; and ambrose 's de poenitentia besides his copy of the decretals , he left at his death over fifty books to the monks of durham , and the list of those volumes still exists
