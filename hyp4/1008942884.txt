the highway is located in the southwestern districts of berlin , linking the stadtring at the funkturm junction in charlottenburg with nikolassee while normal for a road , it is unusually shaped for a race track as it is essentially two long straights in the form of a dual carriageway , with a hairpin corner at each end the 1921 roadway turned out to be insufficient : already , in practice two days before , the young italian driver enrico platé ( not to be confused with the argentinian driver and team owner of the same name ) was involved in a crash that killed his mechanic from 1927 the german grand prix was relocated to the new and more secure nürburgring circuit in the western german eifel range , while the avus received a new asphalt surface and served as an experimental track for rocket cars in an effort to make avus the '' world 's fastest race track '' , the 1936 season was skipped and while the track hosted the cycling road race , the marathon and 50 & nbsp ; km walk athletic events of the 1936 summer olympics , the north curve was turned into a steeply banked turn ( 43° ) made of bricks this race was run in two heats ; during qualifying for the second heat , luigi fagioli stuck his auto union type c on pole position , with a time of 4 minutes and 8.2 seconds at an average speed of 284.31 & nbsp ; km/h ( 176.7 & nbsp ; mph ) - which was the fastest motor racing lap in history until this time was bettered by tony bettenhausen in qualifying for the 1957 race of two worlds at monza no major race was held after 1937 as , in early 1938 , the popular german race driver bernd rosemeyer was killed in a land speed record attempt on a straight section of the autobahn frankfurt–darmstadt ( present-day bundesautobahn 5 ) , at which point the high-speed avus was considered too dangerous for the fast grand prix race cars for post-war racing , the original extremely long straights were shortened by the introduction of a new south turn roughly in the middle ( just before the hüttenweg exit , where it can still be seen ) , reducing the track length to 8.3 & nbsp ; km ( just over 5 miles ) this race weekend also saw the death of french driver jean behra in a supporting sports car race , as his porsche rsk flew over the top of the north turn banking , as there was no wall or fence the length of the track was roughly cut in half twice in the 1980s and 1990 as racing on straights became unpopular in 1995 , the race 2 of dtm had to be cancelled , after a multi-car pileup blocked the circuit ; later that september , british driver kieth o'dor was killed in a super touring car event when his car spun and was rammed sideways it is used as a ( now closed ) public restaurant and motel
