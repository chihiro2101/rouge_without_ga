however , despite the bloodshed and warfare , the regency was also a period of great refinement and cultural achievement , which shaped and altered the societal structure of britain as a whole one of the greatest patrons of the arts and architecture was the prince regent himself ( the future george iv ) as one of the greatest patrons of the arts , the prince regent ordered the costly building and refurbishing of the beautiful and exotic brighton pavilion , the ornate carlton house , as well as many other public works and architecture ( see john nash , james burton , and decimus burton ) naturally , this required dipping into the treasury , and the regent , and later , the king 's exuberance often outstripped his pocket , at the people 's expense in the dingier , less affluent areas of london , thievery , womanising , gambling , the existence of rookeries , and constant drinking ran rampant the population boom—comprising an increase from just under a million in 1801 to one and a quarter million by 1820 —created a wild , roiling , volatile , and vibrant scene according to robert southey , the difference between the strata of society was vast indeed : the squalor that existed beneath the glamour and gloss of regency society provided sharp contrast to the prince regent 's social circle the formation of the regency after the retirement of george iii saw the end of a more pious and reserved society , and gave birth of a more frivolous , ostentatious one this change was influenced by the regent himself , who was kept entirely removed from the machinations of politics and military exploits this did nothing to channel his energies in a more positive direction , thereby leaving him with the pursuit of pleasure as his only outlet , as well as his sole form of rebellion against what he saw as disapproval and censure in the form of his father this development brought about the rise of the wildly popular fashionable novels in which publishers spread the stories , rumours , and flaunting of the rich and aristocratic , not so secretly hinting at the specific identity of these individuals the gap in the hierarchy of society was so great that those of the upper classes could be viewed by those below as wondrous and fantastical fiction , something entirely out of reach yet tangibly there ; 1811 : george augustus frederick , prince of wales , began his nine-year tenure as regent and became known as the prince regent the death of princess charlotte ( the prince regent 's daughter ) from complications of childbirth changed obstetrical practices ; 1820 : death of george iii and the accession of the prince regent as george iv the house of lords passed a bill to grant george iv a divorce from queen caroline , but because of public pressure , the bill was dropped the following is a list of places associated with the regency era : the adelphi theatre almack's angelo 's , a fencing parlor astley 's amphitheatre attingham park bath , somerset
