indirect-burning incense , also called '' non-combustible incense '' , is an aromatic material or combination of materials , such as resins , that does not contain combustible material and so requires a separate heat source the basic ingredients are the bamboo stick , the paste ( generally made of charcoal dust and joss/jiggit/gum/tabu powder – an adhesive made from the bark of litsea glutinosa and other trees ) , and the perfume ingredients - which would be a masala ( spice mix ) powder of ground ingredients into which the stick would be rolled , or a perfume liquid sometimes consisting of synthetic ingredients into which the stick would be dipped the combustible base of a direct burning incense mixture not only binds the fragrant material together but also allows the produced incense to burn with a self-sustained ember , which propagates slowly and evenly through an entire piece of incense with such regularity that it can be used to mark time incense sticks , also known as agarbathi ( or agarbatti ) and joss sticks , in which an incense paste is rolled or moulded around a bamboo stick , are the main forms of incense in india for direct-burning incense , the tip or end of the incense is ignited with a flame or other heat source until the incense begins to turn into ash at the burning end in a process known as '' splitting the foot of the incense stick '' , the bamboo is trimmed to length , soaked , peeled , and split in halves until the thin sticks of bamboo have square cross sections of less than 3mm thumb chinese incense sticks for use in popular religion are generally odorless or only use the slightest trace of jasmine or rose , since it is the smoke , not the scent , which is important in conveying the prayers of the faithful to heaven '' dipped '' or '' hand-dipped '' direct-burning incense is created by dipping '' incense blanks '' made of unscented combustible dust into any suitable kind of essential or fragrance oil mixture density : incense mixtures made with natural binders must not be combined with too much water in mixing , or over-compressed while being formed , which would result in either uneven air distribution or undesirable density in the mixture , causing the incense to burn unevenly , too slowly , or too quickly '' however , the researchers qualified their findings by noting that incense burning in the studied population was associated with certain low-cancer-risk dietary habits , and concluded that '' diet can be a significant confounder of epidemiological studies on air pollution and respiratory health in the case of cored incensed sticks , several methods are employed to coat the sticks cores with incense mixture : paste rolling : a wet , malleable paste of incense mixture is first rolled into a long , thin coil , using a paddle much arabian incense , also called '' bukhoor '' or '' bakhoor '' , is of this type , and japan has a history of kneaded incense , called nerikō or awasekō , made using this method among ethnic chinese and chinese-influenced communities these are traditionally burned at temples , before the threshold of a home or business , before an image of a religious divinity or local spirit , or in shrines , large and small , found at the main entrance of every village the earliest documented use of incense comes from the ancient chinese , who employed incense composed of herbs and plant products ( such as cassia , cinnamon , styrax , and sandalwood ) as a component of numerous formalized ceremonial rites ; aesthetic many people burn incense to appreciate its smell , without assigning any other specific significance to it , in the same way that the foregoing items can be produced or consumed solely for the contemplation or enjoyment of the aroma then , a thin stick is put next to the coil and the stick and paste are rolled together until the stick is centered in the mixture and the desired thickness is achieved there are about 50 large companies that together account for up to 30 % of the market , and around 500 of the companies , including a significant number of the main ones , including moksh agarbatti and cycle pure , are based in mysore paste : powdered or granulated incense material is mixed with a sticky incombustible binder , such as dried fruit , honey , or a soft resin and then formed to balls or small pastilles the first known record is by poet yu jianwu ( 487-551 ) : '' by burning incense we know the o'clock of the night , with graduated candles we confirm the tally of the watches brought to japan in the 6th century by korean bhikkhu , who used the mystical aromas in their purification rites , the delicate scents of koh ( high-quality japanese incense ) became a source of amusement and entertainment with nobles in the imperial court during the heian era 200 years later the research team noted that '' this association is consistent with a large number of studies identifying carcinogens in incense smoke , and given the widespread and sometimes involuntary exposure to smoke from burning incense , these findings carry significant public health implications the raw materials are powdered and then mixed together with a binder to form a paste , which , for direct burning incense , is then cut and dried into pellets coil : extruded and shaped into a coil without a core , coil incense can burn for an extended period , from hours to days , and is commonly produced and used in chinese cultures commercially , two types of incense base predominate : fuel and oxidizer mixtures : charcoal or wood powder provides the fuel for combustion while an oxidizer such as sodium nitrate or potassium nitrate sustains the burning of the incense direct-burning incense , also called '' combustible incense '' , is lit directly by a flame fragrant materials are added to the base prior to shaping , as in the case of powdered incense materials , or after , as in the case of essential oils , the art of incense appreciation , is generally practiced as a separate art form from the tea ceremony , and usually within a tea room of traditional zen design indirect-burning incense is burned directly on top of a heat source or on a hot metal plate in a censer or thurible in contrast , epidemiologists at the hong kong anti-cancer society , aichi cancer center in nagoya , and several other centers found : '' no association was found between exposure to incense burning and respiratory symptoms like chronic cough , chronic sputum , chronic bronchitis , runny nose , wheezing , asthma , allergic rhinitis , or pneumonia among the three populations studied : i.e the glowing ember on the incense will continue to smoulder and burn the rest of the incense without further application of external heat or flame the incense dough is then pressed into shaped forms to create cone and smaller coiled incense , or forced through a hydraulic press for solid stick incense although the ceremonial use of incense was abandoned until the oxford movement , it was common to have incense ( typically frankincense ) burned before grand occasions , when the church would be crowded a survey of risk factors for lung cancer , also conducted in taiwan , noted an inverse association between incense burning and adenocarcinoma of the lung , though the finding was not deemed significant a study published in 2008 in the medical journal cancer found that incense use is associated with a statistically significant higher risk of cancers of the upper respiratory tract , with the exception of nasopharyngeal cancer cored stick : a supporting core of bamboo is coated with a thick layer of incense material that burns away with the core research carried out in taiwan in 2001 linked the burning of incense sticks to the slow accumulation of potential carcinogens in a poorly ventilated environment by measuring the levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( including benzopyrene ) within buddhist temples a bundle of the supporting material ( typically thin bamboo or sandalwood slivers ) is soaked in water or a thin water/glue mixture for a short time they can generally be separated into '' direct-burning '' and '' indirect-burning '' types these include : makko ( incense powder ) made from the bark of various trees in the genus persea ( such as persea thunbergii ) xiangnan pi ( made from the bark of trees of genus phoebe such as phoebe nanmu or persea zuihoensis ketoret was the incense offered in the temple in jerusalem and is stated in the book of exodus to be a mixture of stacte , onycha , galbanum and frankincense in greece this rolled incense resin is called 'moskolibano ' , and generally comes in either a pink or green colour denoting the fragrance , with pink being rose and green being jasmine ; religious religious use of incense is prevalent in many cultures and may have roots in the practical and aesthetic uses , considering that many of these religions have little else in common incense smoke contains various contaminants including gaseous pollutants , such as carbon monoxide ( co ) , nitrogen oxides ( no x ) , sulfur oxides ( so x ) , volatile organic compounds ( vocs ) , and adsorbed toxic pollutants ( polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and toxic metals ) paper : paper infused with resin or oils extracted from fragrant material , folded accordion style , is lit and blown out such use was common in judaic worship and remains in use for example in the catholic , orthodox , and anglican churches , taoist and buddhist chinese jingxiang ( 敬香 '' offer incense to ancestors/gods ) , etc the thin sticks are evenly separated , then dipped into a tray of incense powder consisting of fragrance materials and occasionally a plant-based binder stick machines are sometimes used , which coat the stick with paste and perfume , though the bulk of production is done by hand rolling at home the technique used is called “ smoke cleansing ” and is done by holding a healing stone over the smoke of burning incense for 20 to 30 seconds the flame is then fanned or blown out , leaving the incense to smolder
