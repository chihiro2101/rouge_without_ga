australia , for instance , is unique in that it came into existence as a nation by the democratic vote of the citizens of each state , who voted '' yes '' in referendums to adopt the australian constitution the difference between a federation and this kind of unitary state is that in a unitary state the autonomous status of self-governing regions exists by the sufferance of the central government , and may be unilaterally revoked while it is common for a federation to be brought into being by agreement between a number of formally independent states , in a unitary state self-governing regions are often created through a process of devolution , where a formerly centralized state agrees to grant autonomy to a region that was previously entirely subordinate it is often part of the philosophy of a unitary state that , regardless of the actual status of any of its parts , its entire territory constitutes a single sovereign entity or nation state , and that by virtue of this the central government exercises sovereignty over the whole territory as of right while the word confederation was officially used when the canadian federal system was established in 1867 , the term refers only to the process and not the resulting state since canadian provinces are not sovereign and do not claim to be a confederation is most likely to feature three differences when contrasted with a federation : ( 1 ) no real direct powers : many confederal decisions are externalized by member-state legislation ; ( 2 ) decisions on day-to-day-matters are not taken by simple majority but by special majorities or even by consensus or unanimity ( veto for every member ) ; ( 3 ) changes of the constitution , usually a treaty , require unanimity in the wake of the civil war of the latter , use the term '' confederation '' to refer to the formation or joining , not the structure , of canada on the other hand , a political entity that is an empire in name , may comprise several partly autonomous kingdoms organised together in a federation , with the empire being ruled over by an emperor or senior king ( great king , high king , king of kings a federation differs from a devolution , such as indonesia and the united kingdom , because , in a devolved state , the central government can revoke the independence of the subunits ( scottish parliament , senedd cymru – welsh parliament , northern ireland assembly in the case of the uk ) without changing the constitution a federation also differs from an associated state , such as the federated states of micronesia ( in free association with the united states ) and cook islands and niue ( which form part of the realm of new zealand ) there are two kinds of associated states : in case of micronesia , the association is concluded by a treaty between two sovereign states ; in the case of the cook islands and niue , the association is concluded by domestic legal arrangements the relation between the crown dependencies of the isle of man and the bailiwicks of guernsey and jersey in the channel islands and the united kingdom is very similar to a federate relation : the islands enjoy independence from the united kingdom , which , via the crown , takes care of their foreign relations and defense – although the uk parliament does have overall power to legislate for the dependencies the islands do not have a monarch , per se ; rather in the isle of man the british monarch is , ex officio , lord of mann , and in the bailiwicks of guernsey and jersey , the british monarch rules as the duke of normandy a unitary state may closely resemble a federation in structure and , while a central government may possess the theoretical right to revoke the autonomy of a self-governing region , it may be politically difficult for it to do so in practice 9 '' , p.70 alexander hamilton robert schuman , the initiator of the european community system , wrote that a transnational community like the founding of the european coal and steel community lay midway between an association of states where they retained complete independence and a federation leading to a fusion of states in a superstate however , its central government is far weaker than that of most federations and the individual members are sovereign states under international law , so it is usually characterized as an unprecedented form of supra-national union constitutionally , the power vested in the special administrative regions of the people 's republic is granted from the central people 's government , through a decision by the national people 's congress however , there have been certain largely informal grants of power to the provinces , to handle economic affairs and implement national policies , resulting in a system some have termed federalism '' with chinese characteristics '' the inability to meet this challenge may lead to the secession of parts of a federation or to civil war , as occurred in the united states ( southern states interpreted slavery under the tenth amendment as a state right , while northern states were against slavery , with a catalysis occurring in the then–bleeding kansas ) , in nigeria and in switzerland in some cases , internal conflict may lead a federation to collapse entirely , as occurred the federation of rhodesia and nyasaland , the gran
