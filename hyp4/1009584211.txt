assisted suicide is when another person materially helps an individual person die by suicide , such as providing tools or equipment , while physician-assisted suicide involves a physician ( doctor ) '' knowingly and intentionally providing a person with the knowledge or means or both required to commit suicide , including counseling about lethal doses of drugs , prescribing such lethal doses or supplying the drugs '' in the state of oregon 's 2015 survey , they asked the terminally ill who were participating in medical aid in dying , what their biggest end-of-life concerns were : 96.2 % of those people mentioned the loss of the ability to participate in activities that once made them enjoy life , 92.4 % mentioned the loss of autonomy , or their independence of their own thoughts or actions , and 75.4 % stated loss of their dignity pain is mostly not reported as the primary motivation for seeking physician-assisted suicide in the united states ; the three most frequently mentioned end‐of‐life concerns reported by oregon residents who took advantage of the death with dignity act in 2015 were : decreasing ability to participate in activities that made life enjoyable ( 96.2 % ) , loss of autonomy ( 92.4 % ) , and loss of dignity ( 75.4 % ) a written request which must be witnessed by two different people , one of which can not be a family member , and then another waiting period by the patient 's doctor in which they say whether they are eligible for the drugs or not ( '' death with dignity '' ) according to a 1988 general resolution , '' unitarian universalists advocate the right to self-determination in dying , and the release from civil or criminal penalties of those who , under proper safeguards , act to honor the right of terminally ill patients to select the time of their own deaths '' a study of hospice nurses and social workers in oregon reported that symptoms of pain , depression , anxiety , extreme air hunger and fear of the process of dying were more pronounced among hospice patients who did not request a lethal prescription for barbiturates , the drug used for physician assisted death polls conducted by gallup dating back to 1947 positing the question , '' when a person has a disease that can not be cured , do you think doctors should be allowed to end the patient 's life by some painless means if the patient and his family request it ? '' show support for the practice increasing from 37 % in 1947 to a plateau of approximately 75 % lasting from approximately 1990 to 2005 it is widely acknowledged that physicians must play some role in the process of assisted suicide and voluntary euthanasia ( as evident in the name '' physician-assisted suicide '' ) , often putting them at the forefront of the issue the roman catholic church teaches its followers that the act of euthanasia is unacceptable because it is perceived as a sin , as it goes against the ten commandments , ten commandments in catholic theology as implied by the fifth commandment , the act of assisted suicide contradicts the dignity of human life as well as the respect one has for god killing a person who does not want to die , or who is capable of giving consent and whose consent has not been solicited , is the crime of involuntary euthanasia , and is regarded as murder this argument encompasses the apprehension that once pas is initiated for the terminally ill it will progress to other vulnerable communities , namely the disabled , and may begin to be used by those who feel less worthy based on their demographic or socioeconomic status a survey from the journal of palliative medicine found that family caregivers of patients who chose assisted death were more likely to find positive meaning in caring for a patient and were more prepared for accepting a patient 's death than the family caregivers of patients who did n't request assisted death assisted suicide is contrasted to euthanasia , sometimes referred to as mercy killing , where the person dying does not directly bring about their own death , but is killed in order to stop the person from experiencing further suffering the declaration of geneva is a revision of the hippocratic oath , first drafted in 1948 by the world medical association in response to forced ( involuntary ) euthanasia , eugenics and other medical crimes performed in nazi germany as an alternative to the physician-assisted suicide and in order to alleviate pain , the catholic church proposes that terminally ill patients focus on religion and making peace with the creator while receiving the love and mercy of their families and caregivers some advocates for assisted suicide strongly oppose the use of '' assisted suicide '' and '' suicide '' when referring to physician-assisted suicide , and prefer the phrase '' assisted dying '' the conclusion of the majority of later rabbinic authorities , and accepted normative practice within judaism , is that suicide and assisted suicide can not be sanctioned even for a terminal patient in intractable pain an oppressive system ( stemming from non-suicidal perspectives ) functioning at the normative , discursive , medical , legal , social , political , economic , and epistemic levels in which suicidal people experience multiple forms of injustice and violence in oregon and other states , two doctors and two witnesses must assert that a person 's request for a lethal prescription was n't coerced or under undue influence to reduce the oppression of suicidal people , alexandre baril , a professor in social work , suggest to validate suicidal ideation as a legitimate experience and create a welcoming environment to listen to their voice
