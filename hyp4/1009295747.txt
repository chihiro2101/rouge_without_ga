blood in the urine is the most common symptom in bladder cancer , and is painless blood in the urine may also be caused by other conditions , such as bladder or ureteric stones , infection , kidney disease , kidney cancers or vascular malformations , though these conditions ( except kidney cancers ) would typically be painful these signs and symptoms are not specific to bladder cancer , and may also be caused by non-cancerous conditions , including prostate infections , overactive bladder or cystitis tobacco smoking is the main known contributor to urinary bladder cancer ; in most populations , smoking is associated with over half of bladder cancer cases in men and one-third of cases among women , however these proportions have reduced over recent years since there are fewer smokers in europe and north america opium consumption increases the risk of bladder cancer by 3-fold and concurrent use of opium and smoking increases the risk of bladder cancer by 5 times compared to the general population occupational or circumstantial exposure to the following substances has been implicated as a cause of bladder cancer ; benzidine ( dyes manufacturing ) , 4-aminobiphenyl ( rubber industry ) , 2-naphtylamine ( azo dyes manufacturing , foundry fumes , rubber industry , cigarette smoke and cancer research ) , phenacetin ( analgesic ) , arsenic and chlorinated aliphatic compound in drinking water , auramine ( dye manufacturing ) , magenta ( dye manufacturing ) , ortho-toluidine ( dye manufacturing ) , epoxy and polyurethane resin hardening agents ( plastics industry ) , chlornaphazine , coal tar mutations of p53 are detected in 73 % of the tumors , bcl-2 mutations accounting for 32 % and the combination of the two accounting for 13 % other causes of squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder include chronic catheterizations in people with a spinal cord injury and history of treatment with cyclophosphamide mutations in fgfr3 , tp53 , pik3ca , kdm6a , arid1a , kmt2d , hras , tert , kras , crebbp , rb1 and tsc1 genes may be associated with some cases of bladder cancer currently , the best diagnosis of the state of the bladder is by way of cystoscopy , which is a procedure in which a flexible or rigid tube ( called a cystoscope ) bearing a camera and various instruments is introduced into the bladder through the urethra however , visual detection in any form listed above , is not sufficient for establishing pathological classification , cell type or the stage of the present tumor if invasive or high grade ( includes carcinoma in situ ) cancer is detected on turbt , an mri and/or ct scan of the abdomen and pelvis or urogram and ct scan or x-ray chest should be conducted for disease staging and to look for cancer spread ( metastasis ) in united states the fda has approved nmp22 , nmp22 bladderchek , and urovysion tests for detection and surveillance of bladder cancer and immunocyt , bta-trak , and bta-stat tests have been approved for surveillance only globally , in 2017 , bladder cancer resulted in 196,000 deaths , a 5.4 % ( age adjusted ) decrease from 2007 in 2018 , the age adjusted rates of new cases of bladder cancer was 6 cases per 100,000 people and age adjusted death rate was 2 deaths per 100,000 people one other reason is that the androgen receptor , which is much more active in men than in women , may play a part in the development of the cancer in africa , men are more prone to do field work and are exposed to infection with schistosoma , this may explain to a certain extent the gap in incidence of squamous cell cancers in areas where bladder cancer is endemic one of the common signs of bladder cancer is hematuria and is quite often misdiagnosed as urinary tract infection in women , leading to a delay in diagnosis bladder cancer is the sixth most common cancer accounting for 3.7 % of the new cancer cases in 2018 , 30,700 canadians were living with bladder cancer , 9160 new cases were diagnosed and 2467 died from it geographic variation is seen in survival rates with 5-year survival rates of 75 % in northern to 65 % in eastern europe bladder cancer is the ninth most common cancer in the uk accounting for 2.7 % of all the new cancers cases in the united states in 2019 80,470 cases and 17,670 deaths are expected making it the sixth most common type of cancer in the region bladder cancer is the fourth most common type of cancer in men and the 12th most common cancer in women
