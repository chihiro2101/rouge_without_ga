donated in advance whatever should be discovered underneath the palace and made an ongoing financial contribution to the expenses of the excavation ; by july of that year , it became clear that the conditions were extremely difficult and that the stability of the teatro olimpia might well be compromised ; when about half the monument had been examined and 53 fragments recovered , the excavation was called to a halt the fragments , although not complete , were collected and joined together to rebuild the ara ; due to the short time available ( work had to be completed before 23 september 1938 , the last day of the augustan anniversary ) , few fragments available and poor historical sources to refer to for restoration ( basically a couple of ancient roman coins ) , the reconstruction had to be performed with the help of italian artist odoardo ferretti charles brian rose wrote '' the variable value of the eastern costume and the uneasy interaction of trojan and parthian iconography can

building construction caused new arguments and criticism , after the ones which accompanied the first building construction , both from roman inhabitants and foreign observers , probably due both to political memory tied to the pre-existing pavilion and to the visual impact of the new pavilion , which in the opinion of many is in stark contrast with surrounding historical buildings the long friezes of the ara pacis ( the north and south walls ) contain figures advancing towards the west , who participate in a state of thanksgiving to celebrate the peace created by augustus due to the widespread depiction around the sculpture of scenes of peace , and because the altar is named for '' peace '' , the favoured conclusion is that the goddess is pax in 1938 the finally reconstructed ara was placed near the mausoleum of augustus , and a big pavilion was built around it by architect vittorio ballio morpurgo as part of benito mussolini 's attempt to create an ancient roman '' theme park

of other members of the family with undesirable traits also suffered similar delays , notably augustus ' youngest grandson , agrippa postumus , who had no career , and germanicus ' brother , the later emperor , claudius , whose career started late pollini provides the best summary of this viewpoint in his article , '' ahenobarbi , appuleii and some others on the ara pacis '' , where he points out

romulus , and remus is entirely speculative this helps prove that the ceremony is an event in 13 , although a few scholars continued to argue the ceremony was that of 9 bc ( until definitive proof in favor of 13 came out in 1939 ) the lower register of the interior walls imitate the appearance of traditionally wooden altar precincts , which were meant to bring to mind other such altars in rome and the tradition of constructing altars at the boundary of the city 's pomerium the figure of augustus was not discovered until the 1903 excavation , and his head was damaged by the cornerstone of the renaissance palazzo built on top of the original ara pacis site the monument consists of a traditional open-air altar at its centre surrounded by precinct walls which are pierced on the eastern and western ends ( so called today because of the modern layout ) by openings and elaborately and finely sculpted entirely in luna marble moretti , in making the glass museum for the ara pacis at mussolini 's command , guessed that the two consuls ( tiberius and varus ) of 13 flank augustus , so he saw this figure as m the ceremony took place in the summer of 13 bc , but not necessarily on 4

troy game held in 13 bc ( see below ) in relation to the domitii ahenobarbi , von domaszewski also proposed in the same 1903 article that the last family on the south wall is that of the father of the emperor nero ( born lucius domitius ahenobarbus ) the sacrificial procession depicts animals being led to sacrifice by figures carved in a republican style similar to the so-called '' altar of

effort the deep-rooted ideological connections among cosmic sovereignty , military force , and fertility that were first outlined by georges dumézil , connections which are attested in early roman culture and more broadly in the substructure of indo-european culture at large the program of the ara pacis addressed this group 's very real fears of cyclical history , and promised that the rule of augustus would avert the cataclysmic destruction of the world predicted by contemporary models of historical thought moretti canonized that gaius was dressed in a '' trojan '' costume for the
