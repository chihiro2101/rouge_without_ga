this difference in disciplinary perspectives is addressed by bert chapman in geopolitics : a guide to the issues , in which chapman makes note that academic and professional international relations journals are more amenable to the study and analysis of geopolitics , and in particular classical geopolitics , than contemporary academic journals in the field of political geography aleksandr dugin , a russian political analyst who has developed a close relationship with russia 's academy of the general staff wrote '' the foundations of geopolitics '' in 1997 , which has had a large influence within the russian military , police , and foreign policy elites and it has been used as a textbook in the academy of the general staff of the russian military spykman adopts mackinder 's divisions of the world , renaming some : the heartland ; the rimland ( analogous to mackinder 's '' inner or marginal crescent '' also an intermediate region , lying between the heartland and the marginal sea powers ) ; and the offshore islands & continents ( mackinder 's '' outer or insular crescent '' ) '' mackinder located his pivot , in the words of haushofer , on '' one of the first solid , geopolitically and geographically irreproachable maps , presented to one of the earliest scientific forums of the planet – the royal geographic society in london '' haushofer adopted both mackinder 's heartland thesis and his view of the russian-german alliance – powers that mackinder saw as the major contenders for control of eurasia in the twentieth century homer lea , in the day of the saxon ( 1912 ) , asserted that the entire anglo-saxon race faced a threat from german ( teuton ) , russian ( slav ) , and japanese expansionism : the '' fatal '' relationship of russia , japan , and germany '' has now assumed through the urgency of natural forces a coalition directed against the survival of saxon supremacy in 2004 , at the centenary of the geographical pivot of history , famous historian paul kennedy wrote : '' right now with hundreds of thousands of us troops in the eurasian rimlands and with administration constantly explaining why it has to stay the course , it looks as if washington is taking seriously mackinder 's injunction to ensure control of the geographical pivot of history the basic notions of mackinder 's doctrine involve considering the geography of the earth as being divided into two sections : the afro-eurasia or core , comprising eurasia and africa ; and the peripheral '' islands '' , including the americas , australia , japan , the british isles , and oceania chauprade is a supporter of a europe of nations , he advocates a european union excluding turkey , and a policy of compromise with russia ( in the frame of a eurasian alliance which is en vogue among european extreme-right populists ) and supports the idea of a multi-polar world—including a balanced relationship between china and the u.s it follows that… american foreign policy must…employ its influence in eurasia in a manner that creates a stable continental equilibrium , with the united states as the political arbiter.… eurasia is thus the chessboard on which the struggle for global primacy continues to be played , and that struggle involves geo- strategy – the strategic management of geopolitical interests… he proposed six conditions required for a nation to have sea power : advantageous geographical position ; serviceable coastlines , abundant natural resources , and favorable climate ; extent of territory population large enough to defend its territory ; society with an aptitude for the sea and commercial enterprise ; and government with the influence and inclination to dominate the sea thual , aymeric chauprade , former professor of geopolitics at the french war college and now member of the extreme-right party '' front national '' , subscribes to a supposed '' new '' french school of geopolitics which advocates above all a return to realpolitik and '' clash of civilization '' ( huntington ) in disciplines outside geography , geopolitics is not negatively viewed ( as it often is among academic geographers such as carolyn gallaher or klaus dodds ) as a tool of imperialism or associated with nazism , but rather viewed as a valid and consistent manner of assessing major international geopolitical circumstances and events , not necessarily related to armed conflict or military operations negative associations with the term '' geopolitics '' and its practical application stemming from its association with world war ii and pre-world war ii german scholars and students of geopolitics are largely specific to the field of academic geography , and especially sub-disciplines of human geography such as political geography in the 1990s a senior researcher at the institute of philosophy , russian academy of sciences of the russian academy of sciences , ( 1957-2009 ) , coined the term '' island-russia '' and developed the '' great limitrophe '' concept positing that states are organic and growing , with borders representing only a temporary stop in their movement , he held that the expanse of a state 's borders is a reflection of the health of the nation—meaning that static countries are in decline two famous security advisors from the cold war period , henry kissinger and zbigniew brzezinski , argued to continue the united states geopolitical focus on eurasia and , particularly on russia , despite the fall of communism and the end of the cold war but in the meantime it is imperative that no eurasian challenger emerges , capable of dominating eurasia and thus also of challenging america… for america the chief geopolitical prize is eurasia…and america 's global primacy is directly dependent on how long and how effectively its preponderance on the eurasian continent is sustained mahan 's theoretical framework came from antoine-henri jomini , and emphasized that strategic locations ( such as choke points , canals , and coaling stations ) , as well as quantifiable levels of fighting power in a fleet , were conducive to control over the sea the grand chessboard described the american triumph in the cold war in terms of control over eurasia : for the first time ever , a '' non-eurasian '' power had emerged as a key arbiter of '' eurasian '' power relations , who argue that the stigmatization of geopolitics in academia is unhelpful as geopolitics as a field of positivist inquiry maintains potential in researching and resolving topical , often politicized issues such as conflict resolution and prevention , and mitigating climate change france geographer and geopolitician jacques ancel is considered to be the first theoretician of geopolitics in france , and gave a notable series of lectures at the european center of the carnegie endowment for international peace in paris and published géopolitique in 1936 he coined various neologism among them : horogenesis : neologism that describes the concept of studying the birth of borders , dyade : border shared by two neighbouring states ( for instance us territory has two terrestrial dyades : one with canada and one with mexico ) while rejecting the generalizations and broad abstractions employed by the german and anglo-american traditions ( and the new geographers ) , this school does focus on spatial dimension of geopolitics affairs on different levels of analysis more or less connected with this school , stéphane rosière can be quoted as the editor in chief of the online journal l'espace politique , this journal created in 2007 became the most prominent french journal of political geography and geopolitics with hérodote classical geopolitics forms an important element of analysis for military history as well as for sub-disciplines of political science such as international relations and security studies lacoste proposed that every conflict ( both local or global ) can be considered from a perspective grounded in three assumptions : representation : each group or individuals is the product of an education and is characterized by specific representations of the world or others groups or individuals colonel-general leonid ivashov ( retired ) , a russian geopolitics specialist of the early 21st century , headed the academy of geopolitical problems , which analyzes the international and domestic situations and develops geopolitical doctrine friedrich ratzel ( 1844–1904 ) , influenced by thinkers such as darwin and zoology ernst heinrich haeckel , contributed to 'geopolitik ' by the expansion on the biological conception of geography , without a static conception of borders national socialism rejected in principle both materialism and determinism and also elevated innate human qualities , in the form of a hypothesized 'racial character , ' to the factor of greatest significance in the constitution of human society '' they would argue … that russia , regardless of who governs it , sits astride the territory which halford mackinder called the geopolitical heartland , and it is the heir to one of the most potent imperial traditions however , this negative association is not as strong in disciplines such as history or political science , which make use of geopolitical concepts considered as one of the founders of french geopolitics , élisée reclus , is the author of a book considered as a reference in modern geography ( nouvelle géographie universelle ) alfred thayer mahan , the problem of asia and the effects upon international politics , ( washington and london : kennikat press , 1920 , p 25-27 , 167-8 , 172 ) 821-2 spykman 's vision of eurasia was strongly confirmed : '' geopolitically , america is an island off the shores of the large landmass of eurasia ,
