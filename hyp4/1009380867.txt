ciclosporin is approved by the fda to treat and prevent graft-versus-host disease in bone marrow transplantation and to prevent rejection of kidney , heart , and liver transplants sandimmune label it is also approved in the us for treating of rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis , persistent nummular keratitis following adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis , and as eye drops for treating dry eyes caused by sjögren 's syndrome and meibomian gland dysfunction in addition to these indications , ciclosporin is also used in severe atopic dermatitis , kimura disease , pyoderma gangrenosum , chronic hives , acute systemic mastocytosis , and posterior or intermediate uveitis with noninfective cause side effects of ciclosporin can include gum enlargement , increased hair growth , seizure , peptic ulcers , pancreatitis , fever , vomiting , diarrhea , confusion , hypercholesterolemia , dyspnea , numbness and tingling ( particularly of the lips ) , pruritus , high blood pressure , potassium retention ( possibly leading to hyperkalemia ) , kidney and liver dysfunction , burning sensations at finger tips , and an increased vulnerability to opportunistic fungal and viral infections ciclosporin 's main effect is to lower the activity of t-cells ; it does so by inhibiting calcineurin in the calcineurin–phosphatase pathway and preventing the mitochondrial permeability transition pore from opening calcineurin then dephosphorylates the transcription factor nfatc ( nuclear factor of activated t-cells ) , which moves to the t-cell nucleus and increases the transcription of genes for il-2 and related cytokines some sources list the fungus under an alternative species name hypocladium inflatum gams such as pritchard and sneader in 2005 : however , the name , '' beauveria nivea '' , also appears in several other articles including in a 2001 online publication by harriet upton entitled '' origin of drugs in current use : the cyclosporin story '' ( retrieved june 19 , 2005 ) the metabolites , which include cyclosporin b , c , d , e , h , and l , have less than 10 % of ciclosporin 's immunosuppressant activity and are associated with higher kidney toxicity cyclosporin synthetase substrates include l-valine , l-leucine , l-alanine , glycine , 2-aminobutyric acid , 4-methylthreonine , and d-alanine , which is the starting amino acid in the biosynthetic process in 1970 , new strains of fungi were isolated from soil samples taken from norway and from wisconsin in the us by employees of sandoz ( now novartis ) in basel , switzerland per international nonproprietary name ( inn ) guidelines for drugs , the y was replaced with i so that the inn for the medication is spelled ciclosporin ciclosporin is the inn and the british approved name ( ban ) , while cyclosporine is the united states adopted name ( usan ) and cyclosporin is a former ban ciclosporin exhibits very poor solubility in water , and , as a consequence , suspension and emulsion forms of the medication have been developed for oral administration and for injection ciclosporin was originally brought to market by sandoz ( now novartis ) , under the brand name sandimmune , which is available as soft gelatin capsules , an oral solution , and a formulation for intravenous administration constitutively high levels of mitochondrial cause inappropriate mptp opening leading to a decrease in the cardiac range of function , leading to cardiac hypertrophy as an attempt to compensate for the problem csa binds to cyclophilin d to block the opening of mptp , and thus decreases the release of protein cytochrome c , which can cause programmed cell death cypd is a protein within the mptp that acts as a gate ; binding by csa decreases the amount of inappropriate opening of mptp , which decreases the intramitochondrial unlike the human form of the medication , the lower doses used in dogs mean the drug acts as an immunomodulator and has fewer side effects than in humans it is also used to treat sebaceous adenitis ( immune response against the sebaceous glands ) , pemphigus foliaceus ( autoimmune blistering skin disease ) , inflammatory bowel disease , anal furunculosis ( anal inflammatory disease ) , and myasthenia gravis ( a neuromuscular disease )
