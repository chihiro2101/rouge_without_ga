the consul explains that in such cases in mexico the dead child always needs to be accompanied by an adult , leading to a reference to william blaxton , '' the man who went to live among the indians '' , under the volcano 53 yvonne and the consul leave the hotel and walk through town , along the palace of cortés , cuernavaca ; they stop at a printer 's shop window , their attention drawn by a photograph of a boulder split in two by the elements , an image yvonne immediately recognises as emblematic of her marriage on the way to their house in the calle nicaragua they stop at jacques laruelle 's '' bizarre '' house , with the inscription no se puede vivir sin amar ( '' one can not live without loving '' ) on the wall , and popocatepetl and ixtaccihuatl come into view while yvonne is in the bathroom , however , he leaves the house to visit a cantina but falls facedown in the street , passed out , and is almost run over by an english driver in an mg magna who offers him burke 's whisky from a flask back at the house , he enters yvonne 's bedroom but their conversation is halted , in part by the temptation of the bottle of johnnie walker he knows is on the patio and in part by hallucinations while the consul is sleeping , hugh and yvonne rent horses and ride through the countryside , stopping at a brewery and then at the country estate of maximilian i of mexico , haunted by the memory of maximilian and his consort carlota , and of the consul and yvonne in happier times the chapter begins with a vision of a man suffering unquenchable thirst ; while the consul inspects his garden ( the garden of eden is referenced throughout , and a snake crosses his path ) he finds a bottle of tequila he had hidden , and sees a newly placed sign : le gusta este jardin ? que es suyo ? evite que sus hijos lo destruyan ! he mistranslates this as '' you like this garden ? why is it yours ? we evict those who destroy ! '' as he is getting more drunk he has visions of the farolito , a bar in parian quincey obviously disdains the drunk consul , who speaks of the garden of eden and proposes that perhaps adam 's punishment was to continue to live in the garden of eden , alone , '' cut off from god '' hugh and yvonne return , and the consul wakes up from a black-out in the bathroom , slowly remembering the strained conversation during which it is decided that rather than accept vigil 's offer of a day trip to guanajuato they will go to tomalin , near parian as the chapter continues , she reminisces about her childhood and early adulthood in multiple instances ; for example , when she claimed to see her father come toward her in a hallucination , when she thinks about her mother ’ s death around the time of world war i , and when she discusses her life as an actress in hollywood various landmarks , including the san francisco convent , the city parish and the tlaxcala royal chapel and sanctuary , are mentioned as the consul reads a tourist information booklet and remembers places he and yvonne visited in happier times of their past the final month of a year , the final number on a clock , and the final chapter of under the volcano , told again from the consul 's point of view they push him outside of the bar and out of the light , where they shoot the consul and throw him off the edge of the ravine that the farolito is built atop of his appointment to the consular service is a kind of lateral promotion to get him out of the headlines , and he ends up with the sinecure of a consular position in a mexican town with no british interests by the novel 's start he is actually an ex-consul : he resigned the service at the time when the uk and mexico broke up diplomatic relationships in the aftermath of president lázaro cárdenas 's 1938 nationalisation of the country 's oil reserves born in the moselle area , he grew up in paris and became acquainted with the consul during the summer of 1911 in the beach resort of courseulles-sur-mer , on the channel the entire family , including the mother and the at least six sons , drinks hard and takes long walks in the countryside around their home , across the river mersey and with a view of the welsh mountains juan cerillo , a mexican national who was in spain with hugh and is now an agent for a cooperative holding made possible by the nationalisations of president lázaro cárdenas : he transports money between rural cooperatives and farmers and the national credit bank ( much like the murdered indian in chapter vii ) lowry alludes to goethe 's faust as well and uses a quote for one of his three epigraphs but marlowe 's dominates , with the consul being suggested as a faustian black magician by hugh the consul '' often associates himself with faustus as a suffering soul who can not ask for salvation , or who even runs toward hell '' , and parodies marlowe 's line about helen of troy ( '' was this the face that launched a thousand ships , / and burnt the topless towers of illium ? '' marlowe 5.2.97–98 the book opens on the last page of doctor faustus , and the four lines laruelle reads are particularly appropriate to the consul : '' cut is the branch that might have grown full straight , throughout the novel the number 7 appears—branded on the horse which is encountered in many of the chapters , and often as time : laruelle 's day of the dead , in the first chapter , ends at 7 pm ; yvonne returns to the consul at 7 am and the day that takes up chapters 2 through 12 ends at 7 pm ; at the novel 's close , the clock strikes seven times and a cock appears to confirm the indian belief that '' a cock crowing seven times announces death '' , while the clock also announces the opening of the seven seals flint in the kenyon review , called it '' one of the most readable novels to appear since the war '' but ultimately criticised it severely for its '' second-handedness '' , saying that lowry '' lacks the confidence of the innovator '' '' in the new york review of books , critic michael wood wrote , '' under the volcano is a great book about missing grandeur , about the specialised tragedy that lies in the unavailability of the tragedy you want lowry is closer to melville and conrad than joyce , but he creates his corner of mexico in a manner similar to the dublin of ulysses : not by describing it so much as by building an alternate reality from language '' novelist elizabeth lowry ( no relation ) , writing in the london review of books , described it as a '' black masterpiece about the horrors of alcoholic disintegration '' reviewing gordon bowker 's biography of lowry , the new york times commented on volcano 's legacy : '' under the volcano is too famous to be just a cult object , but more than most great novels it is revisited year after year by a few zealous defenders , who place lowry high up in the modernist pantheon , while the rest of the world is only barely aware of his masterpiece as an exotic and harrowing read '' modern library 100 best novels of english novels in the 20th century lists the book at position 11 volcano : an inquiry into the life and death of malcolm lowry ( 1976 ) is a national film board of canada documentary produced by donald brittain and robert a the novel was the inspiration for the 1971 song '' the consul at sunset '' by jack bruce and pete brown , as well as the 1987 song '' back room of the bar '' by the young fresh fellows
