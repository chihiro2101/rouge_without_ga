the area was joined to the railway network in the mid-19th century ; and since the creation of the new town , there have been major road upgrades ( including a motorway link ) , a guided bus transit system and the establishment of an airport which has become one of britain 's largest and busiest it did not seek to attract companies by offering financial or other incentives ; instead , it set out to create the ideal conditions for industrial development to arise naturally , by providing large plots of land with room for expansion , allowing firms to build their own premises or rent ready-made buildings , and constructing a wide range of building types and sizes the manor royal estate , with its space , proximity to gatwick airport and good transport links , attracted airport-related services such as logistics , catering , distribution and warehousing ; and the corporation and private companies built offices throughout the town it was bypassed by a new dual carriageway in 1938 ( which forms the a23 's current route through the town ) , and then later to the east side of the town by the m23 motorway , which was opened in 1975 its advantages included flat land with no existing development ; proximity to the london–brighton railway line , the a23 and the planned m23 ; space for railway sidings ( which were eventually built on a much smaller scale than envisaged ) ; and an adjacent site reserved for future expansion , on the other side of the railway line ( again , not used for this purpose in the end ) despite the lack of direct incentives , many firms applied to move to the manor royal estate : it was considered such an attractive place to relocate to that the development corporation was able to choose between applicants to achieve the ideal mix of firms , and little advertising or promotion had to be undertaken changes brought about by the scheme have included of additional retail space in queen 's square and the martlets , and a mixed-use development at the southern end of the high street on land formerly occupied by robinson road ( which was demolished ) and spencers road ( shortened and severed at one end ) even before the new town was planned , crawley was a retail centre for the surrounding area : there were 177 shops in the town in 1948 , 99 of which were on the high street ( the name derives from a local corruption of the word '' heath '' , which came to refer specifically to the expanse of wooded land , south of the town centre , in which the theatre was built crawley development corporation made little provision for the arts in the plans for the new town , and a proposed arts venue in the town centre was never built the borough is the police headquarters for the west sussex division , and is itself divided into three areas for the purposes of neighbourhood policing : crawley east , crawley west , and crawley town centre the memorial gardens , on the eastern side of queen 's square , feature art displays , children 's play areas and lawns , and a plaque commemorating those who died in two second world war bombing incidents in 1943 and 1944 in 2004 , a proposal was made for an additional campus of the university of sussex to be created in crawley , but as of 2008 no conclusion has been reached industrial development had to take place relatively soon after the new town was established because part of the corporation 's remit was to move people and jobs out of an overcrowded and war-damaged london residents in most parts of crawley receive their drinking water from southern water ; areas in the north of the town around gatwick airport are provided by sutton & east surrey water ; and south east water supplies maidenbower the town centre was completed by 1960 , by which time crawley was already recognised as an important regional , rather than merely local , shopping centre the development corporation wanted the new town to support a large and mixed industrial base , with factories and other buildings based in a single zone rather than spread throughout the town the remaining land between this area and the railway line was sold for private development by 1982 ; in 1992 a shopping centre named county mall and anchored by an owen owen department store was opened there stone age and bronze age remains discovered in the area are on display , as well as more recent artefacts including parts of vine cottage , an old timber-framed building on the high street which was once home to former punch editor mark lemon and which was demolished when the asda development was built there were proposals to close the airport in the late 1940s , but in 1950 the government announced that it was to be developed as london 's second airport kevin muscat , a footballer who has played for australia since 1994 and had a nine-year spell in britain , playing for four different clubs , was born in the town in 2005 , crawley leisure centre was closed and replaced by a new facility , the k2 leisure centre , on the campus of thomas bennett community college near the broadfield stadium danish company novo nordisk , which manufactures much of the world 's insulin supply , has its uk headquarters at the broadfield business park , and bdo global has an office in crawley regular train services run from crawley , and also ifield , to london victoria and london bridge stations , gatwick airport , east croydon , horsham , bognor regis , chichester , portsmouth and southampton early new town residents relied on these shopping facilities until the corporation implemented the master plan 's designs for a new shopping area on the mostly undeveloped land east of the high street and north of the railway line robinson road , previously named church road , had been at the heart of the old crawley : a century before its demolition , its buildings included two chapels , a school , a hospital and a post office the a2220 follows the former route of the a264 through the town , linking the a23 directly to the a264 at copthorne , from where it then runs to east grinstead in the 1960s and 1970s , large branches of tesco , sainsbury 's and marks & spencer were opened ( the tesco superstore was the largest in britain at the time ) the shopping area was also expanded southeastwards from queen 's square : although the original plans of 1975 were not implemented fully , several large shop units were built and a new pedestrianised link—the martlets—was provided between queen 's square and haslett avenue , the main road to three bridges the town 's main bus station was redesigned , roads including the main a2220 haslett avenue were rerouted , and some buildings at the south end of the martlets were demolished to accommodate the mall gas was piped from croydon , away , and a gasworks at redhill , while the town 's water supply came from the weir wood reservoir south of east grinstead and another at pease pottage the surrey and sussex was judged as '' weak '' by the healthcare commission in 2008 , however in 2015 both the hospital and the surrey and sussex trust were rated good by the care quality commission a coach station was opened by southdown in 1931 on the a23 at county oak , near lowfield heath : it was a regular stopping point for express coaches between london and towns on the sussex coast neighbourhood community centres and the tilgate forest recreational centre were used for some cultural activities , but it was not until 1988 that the town had a dedicated theatre and arts venue , at the hawth theatre the provision of public services was made in co-operation with the local authorities as the town grew in the 1950s and 1960s the town is served by the london regional versions of bbc and itv television from the crystal palace or reigate transmitters—although some terrestrial aerials in the town may pick up bbc south and itv meridian signals from the midhurst transmitter jpg romesh ranganathan file : eng-pan ( 22 ) 2018-6-69 gareth
