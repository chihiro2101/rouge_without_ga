, the taste of food ) and the unconditioned response ( ur ) to the unconditioned stimulus is an unlearned reflex response ( e.g for this and other reasons , most learning theorists suggest that the conditioned stimulus comes to signal or predict the unconditioned stimulus , and go on to analyze the consequences of this signal classical conditioning differs from operant conditioning : in classical conditioning , behaviors are modified through the association of stimuli as described above , whereas in operant conditioning behaviors are modified by the effect they produce ( i.e ( the 1960 edition is not an unaltered republication of the 1927 translation by oxford university press ) during his research on the physiology of digestion in dogs , pavlov developed a procedure that enabled him to study the digestive processes of animals over long periods of time the sound of a metronome ) and then gave the dog food ; after a few repetitions , the dogs started to salivate in response to the stimulus pavlov concluded that if a particular stimulus in the dog 's surroundings was present when the dog was given food then that stimulus could become associated with food and cause salivation on its own the conditioned response ( cr ) is the response to the conditioned stimulus , whereas the unconditioned response ( ur ) corresponds to the unconditioned stimulus pavlov reported many basic facts about conditioning ; for example , he found that learning occurred most rapidly when the interval between the cs and the appearance of the us was relatively short as noted earlier , it is often thought that the conditioned response is a replica of the unconditioned response , but pavlov noted that saliva produced by the cs differs in composition from that produced by the us in fact , the cr may be any new response to the previously neutral cs that can be clearly linked to experience with the conditional relationship of cs and us it was also thought that repeated pairings are necessary for conditioning to emerge , but many crs can be learned with a single trial , especially in fear conditioning and taste aversion learning if in the above buzzer example , the puff came a second after the sound of the buzzer stopped , that would be trace conditioning , with a trace or conditioning interval of one second for example : if a person hears a bell and has air puffed into their eye at the same time , and repeated pairings like this led to the person blinking when they hear the bell despite the puff of air being absent , this demonstrates that simultaneous conditioning has occurred then a second neutral stimulus ( '' cs2 '' ) is paired with the first ( cs1 ) and comes to yield its own conditioned response this is demonstrated by spontaneous recovery – when there is a sudden appearance of the ( cr ) after extinction occurs – and other related phenomena ( see '' recovery from extinction '' below ) a single cs-us pairing may suffice to yield a cr on a test , but usually a number of pairings are necessary and there is a gradual increase in the conditioned response to the cs the speed of conditioning depends on a number of factors , such as the nature and strength of both the cs and the us , previous experience and the animal 's motivational state disinhibition : if the cs is tested just after extinction and an intense but associatively neutral stimulus has occurred , there may be a temporary recovery of the conditioned response to the cs reinstatement : if the us used in conditioning is presented to a subject in the same place where conditioning and extinction occurred , but without the cs being present , the cs often elicits a response when it is tested later renewal : renewal is a reemergence of a conditioned response following extinction when an animal is returned to the environment in which the conditioned response was acquired conversely , the more the test stimulus differs from the cs , the weaker the cr will be , or the more it will differ from that previously observed latent inhibition refers to the observation that it takes longer for a familiar stimulus to become a cs than it does for a novel stimulus to become a cs , when the stimulus is paired with an effective us then , in a series of trials , the rat is exposed to a cs , a light or a noise , followed by the us , a mild electric shock the rate of pressing during the cs measures the strength of classical conditioning ; that is , the slower the rat presses , the stronger the association of the cs and the us cs+/us trials are continued , but these are interspersed with trials on which the cs+ is paired with a second cs , ( the cs- ) but not with the us ( i.e the blocking effect is observed in a lack of conditional response to cs2 , suggesting that the first phase of training blocked the acquisition of the second cs however , conditioning has also been studied in invertebrates , and very important data on the neural basis of conditioning has come from experiments on the sea slug , aplysia most relevant experiments have used the classical conditioning procedure , although operant conditioning experiments have also been used , and the strength of classical conditioning is often measured through its operant effects , as in conditioned suppression ( see phenomena section above ) and autoshaping for example : the unconditional response to electric shock is an increase in heart rate , whereas a cs that has been paired with the electric shock elicits a decrease in heart rate however , because much of the theoretical research on conditioning in the past 40 years has been instigated by this model or reactions to it , the r–w model deserves a brief description here for example : pairing a bell with a juicy steak is more likely to produce salivation than pairing the bell with a piece of dry bread , and dry bread is likely to work better than a piece of cardboard it specifies the amount of learning that will occur on a single pairing of a conditioning stimulus ( cs ) with an unconditioned stimulus ( us ) in this model the degree of learning is measured by how well the cs predicts the us , which is given by the '' associative strength '' of the cs in the equation , v represents the current associative strength of the cs , and ∆v is the change in this strength that happens on a given trial λ is the maximum associative strength that a given us will support ; its value is usually set to 1 on trials when the us is present , and 0 when the us is absent the amount of learning that happens during any single cs-us pairing depends on the difference between the total associative strengths of cs and other stimuli present in the situation ( σv in the equation ) , and a maximum set by the us ( λ in the equation ) on the first pairing of the cs and us , this difference is large and the associative strength of the cs takes a big step up however , if that same cs is presented without the us but accompanied by a well-established conditioned inhibitor ( ci ) , that is , a stimulus that predicts the absence of a us ( in r-w terms , a stimulus with a negative associate strength ) then r-w predicts that the cs will not undergo extinction ( its v will not decrease in size ) the most important and novel contribution of the r–w model is its assumption that the conditioning of a cs depends not just on that cs alone , and its relationship to the us , but also on all other stimuli present in the conditioning situation the r–w model reduces conditioning to the association of a cs and us , and measures this with a single number , the associative strength of the cs in one of these , proposed by nicholas mackintosh , the speed of conditioning depends on the amount of attention devoted to the cs , and this amount of attention depends in turn on how well the cs predicts the us the role of such context is illustrated by the fact that the dogs in pavlov 's experiment would sometimes start salivating as they approached the experimental apparatus , before they saw or heard any cs as for conditioning , there is evidence that subjects in a blocking experiment do learn something about the '' blocked '' cs , but fail to show this learning because of the way that they are usually tested a number of experiments have shown that humans and animals can learn to time events ( see animal cognition ) , and the gallistel & gibbon model yields very good quantitative fits to a variety of experimental data the rescorla-wagner model treats a stimulus as a single entity , and it represents the associative strength of a stimulus with one number , with no record of how that number was reached more flexibility is provided by assuming that a stimulus is internally represented by a collection of elements , each of which may change from one associative state to another the model has been elaborated in various ways since its introduction , and it can now account in principle for a very wide variety of experimental findings the time of presentation of various stimuli , the state of their elements , and the interactions between the elements , all determine the course of associative processes and the behaviors observed during conditioning experiments the rise and decay of element activation enables the model to explain time-dependent effects such as the fact that conditioning is strongest when the cs comes just before the us , and that when the cs comes after the us ( “ backward conditioning ” ) the result is often an inhibitory cs his physiological account of conditioning has been abandoned , but classical conditioning continues to be used to study the neural structures and functions that underlie learning and memory forms of classical conditioning that are used for this purpose include , among others , fear conditioning , eyeblink conditioning , and the foot contraction conditioning of hermissenda crassicornis , a sea-slug in the case of eyeblink conditioning , the us is an air-puff , while in fear conditioning the us is threatening or aversive such as a foot shock it appears that other regions of the brain , including the hippocampus , amygdala , and prefrontal cortex , contribute to the conditioning process , especially when the demands of the task get more complex the direct projections are sufficient for delay conditioning , but in the case of trace conditioning , where the cs needs to be internally represented despite a lack of external stimulus , indirect pathways are necessary this is an example of counterconditioning , intended to associate the feared stimuli with a response ( relaxation ) that is incompatible with anxiety flooding is a form of desensitization that attempts to eliminate phobias and anxieties by repeated exposure to highly distressing stimuli until the lack of reinforcement of the anxiety response causes its extinction a stimulus that is present when a drug is administered or consumed may eventually evoke a conditioned physiological response that mimics the effect of the drug for example , if a drug causes the body to become less sensitive to pain , the compensatory conditioned reaction may be one that makes the user more sensitive to pain for example , if the drug has always been administered in the same room , the stimuli provided by that room may produce a conditioned compensatory effect ; then an overdose reaction may happen if the drug is administered in a different location where the conditioned stimuli are absent a familiar example is conditioned nausea , in which the cs is the sight or smell of a particular food that in the past has resulted in an unconditioned stomach upset similarly , when the cs is the sight of a dog and the us is the pain of being bitten , the result may be a conditioned fear of dogs for example , sexual arousal has been conditioned in human subjects by pairing a stimulus like a picture of a jar of pennies with views of an erotic film clip pavlovian-instrumental transfer is a phenomenon that occurs when a conditioned stimulus ( cs , also known as a '' cue '' ) that has been associated with rewarding or aversive stimuli via classical conditioning alters motivational salience and operant behavior another example is in anthony burgess ' 1962 dystopian novel a clockwork orange in which the novel 's anti-hero and protagonist , alex , undergoes a procedure called the ludovico technique , where he is fed a solution to cause severe nausea and then forced to watch violent acts with the exciting and positive environment of a game show , the viewer may then start to generate an exciting response to the advertisement because of the association with the environment
