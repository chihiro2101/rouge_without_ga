km , reaching the sea north of acireale ; the villages of santa tecla and stazzo are built on the broad delta built by this lava flow into the sea ; ( 2 ) an eruption in about 1160 ( or 1224 ) , from a fissure at only elevation on the south-southeast flank near the village of mascalucia , whose lava flow reached the sea just to the north of catania , in the area now occupied by the portion of the city named ognina this eruption , which involved activity from seven distinct eruptive fissures mostly on the south slope of the volcano , was well covered by the mass-media because it occurred at the height of the tourist season and numerous reporters and journalists were already in italy to cover the g8 genoa a study on the damage and fatalities caused by eruptions of etna in historical times reveals that only 77 human deaths are attributable with certainty to eruptions of etna , most recently in 1987 when two tourists were killed by a sudden explosion near the summit the history of the life and travels of rabban sawma the 1669 eruption , etna 's most destructive since 122 & nbsp ;
