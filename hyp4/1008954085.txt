according to several scholars , the vast evidence shows how the torii , both etymologically and architecturally , were originally derived from the torana , a free-standing sacred ceremonial gateway which marks the entrance of a sacred enclosure , such as hindu-buddhist temple or shrine , or city this hypothetical stage corresponds to a type of torii in actual use , the so-called , an example of which can be seen in front of ōmiwa shrine 's haiden in nara ( see also the photo in the gallery ) the gate has a purely symbolic function and therefore there usually are no doors or board fences , but exceptions exist , as for example in the case of ōmiwa shrine 's triple-arched torii ( miwa torii , see below ) file : kamakura-gu-torii.jpg an unusual white and red nakayama torii file :

year celebration in a shopping street decorated with christmas lights file : heianjingu tori.jpg an example of a hizen style gate for this reason , the road leading to a shinto shrine ( sandō ) is almost always straddled by one or more torii , which are therefore the easiest way to distinguish a shrine from a buddhist temple ancient indian torana sacred gateway architecture has influenced gateway architecture across asia , specially where silk road transmission of buddhism ; chinese paifang gateways , joseph needham , science and civilization in china , vol 4 part 3 , p137-138 japanese torii gateways , korean hongsalmun gateways , and giant swing in thailand have been derived from the indian torana the famous torii rising from the water at itsukushima is a ryōbu torii , and the shrine used to be also a shingon buddhist temple , so much so that it still has a tō the name '' inari torii '' comes from the fact that vermilion daiwa torii tend to be common at inari shrines , but even at the famous fushimi inari shrine not all torii are in this style ) many buddhist temples include one or more shinto shrines dedicated to their tutelary kami ( '' chinjusha '' ) , and in that case a torii marks the shrine 's entrance the style , which takes its name from nakayama jinja in okayama prefecture , is basically a myōjin torii , but the nuki does not protrude from the pillars and the curve made by the two top lintels is more accentuated than usual a myōjin torii can be made of wood , stone , concrete or other materials and be vermilion or unpainted because the use of symbolic gates is widespread in asia—such structures can be found for example in india , china , thailand , korea , and within nicobarese and shompen villages—historians believe they may be an imported tradition although they do not look like torii and serve a different function , these '' bird perches '' show how birds in several asian cultures are believed to have magic or spiritual properties , and may therefore help explain the enigmatic literal meaning of the torii 's name ( '' bird perch '' ) even today , as prominent a temple as osaka 's shitennō-ji , founded in 593 by shōtoku taishi and the oldest state-built buddhist temple in the world ( and country ) , has a torii straddling one of its entrances this torii was the first to be painted vermilion and to adopt a shimaki at kasuga taisha , the shrine from which it takes its name this relationship between birds and death would also explain why , in spite of their name , no visible trace of birds remains in today 's torii : birds were symbols of death , which in shinto brings defilement ( kegare ) also , because of the strong relationship between shinto shrines and the japanese imperial family , a torii stands also in front of the tomb of each emperor mon ( architecture ) torana , in hindu-buddhist indian-origin also found in southeast asia and east asia toran , ceremonial indian door decoration paifang , in chinese temple architecture hongsalmun , in korean architecture with both religious and other usage iljumun , portal in korean temple architecture the first torii could have evolved already with their present function through the following sequence of events : four posts were placed at the corners of a sacred area and connected with a rope , thus dividing sacred and mundane because the gate was structurally weak , it was reinforced with a tie-beam , and what is today called or ( see illustration at right ) was born almost identical to a kasuga torii ( see illustration above ) , but with the two upper lintels at a slant , the first appeared during the heian period at the center of the nuki there may be a supporting strut called , sometimes covered by a tablet carrying the name of the shrine ( see photo in the gallery ) poles believed to have supported wooden bird figures very similar to the sotdae have been found together with wooden birds , and are believed by some historians to have somehow evolved into today 's torii a rope was tied from one post to the other to mark the border between the outside and the inside , the sacred and the mundane for this reason halls dedicated to her can be found at both temples and shrines , and in either case in front of the hall stands a torii the , which gives the name to the family , is constituted solely by a lintel ( kasagi ) and two pillars ( hashira ) united by a tie beam ( nuki ) this is based on the religious use of bird perches in asia , such as the korean sotdae ( 솟대 ) , which are poles with one or more wooden birds resting on their top the ( see illustration above ) is a type of torii which appears to be formed from three individual torii ( see gallery ) other torii can be found farther into the shrine to represent increasing levels of holiness as one nears the inner sanctuary ( honden ) , core of the shrine this and the shinmei torii style started becoming more popular during the early 20th century at the time of state shinto because they were considered the oldest and most prestigious unlike its chinese counterpart , the hongsal-mun does not vary greatly in design and is always painted red , with '' arrowsticks '' located on the top of the structure ( hence the name ) ( see illustration above ) are gates found only at the inner shrine and outer shrine at ise shrine in mie prefecture the origins of the torii are unknown and there are several different theories on the subject , none of which has gained universal acceptance the second type is similar to the first , but has also a secondary , rectangular lintel ( shimaki ) under the pentagonal kasagi
