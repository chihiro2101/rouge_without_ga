the force applied to the armature is proportional to the change in inductance of the coil with respect to the change in position of the armature and the current flowing through the coil ( see faraday 's law of induction ) the rotary solenoid has a similar appearance to a linear solenoid , except that the armature core is mounted in the center of a large flat disk , with three inclined raceways coined into the underside of the disk the coil is shaped such that the armature can be moved in and out of the space in the center of the coil , altering the coil 's inductance and thereby becoming an electromagnet focusing of the magnetic field and its attendant flux metering , as illustrated in the sae paper , is required to produce a high starting force at the start of the solenoid stroke and to maintain a level or declining force as the solenoid moves through its displacement range when the key is turned to start the car ) , the small electric current forces the starter solenoid to close a pair of heavy contacts , thus relaying the large electric current to the starter motor included in this category of solenoids are the uniquely designed magnetic circuits that effect analog positioning of the solenoid plunger or armature as a function of coil current inherent with the plunger increment of motion , the air gap permeance increases slightly , the magnetic flux increases , the mmf across the air gap decreases slightly ; all of which results in maintaining a high product of mmf x flux because of the increased flux level a rise in ampere-turns drops elsewhere in the ferrous circuit ( predominately in the pole geometry ) causes the reduction of air gap ampere-turns and , therefore , the reduced potential energy of the field at the air gap solenoid-controlled valves are often used in irrigation systems , where a relatively weak solenoid opens and closes a small pilot valve , which in turn activates the main valve by applying fluid pressure to a piston or diaphragm that is mechanically coupled to the main valve when the solenoid is activated , the armature core is magnetically attracted toward the stator pole , and the disk rotates on the ball bearings in the races as it moves towards the coil body any of these will result in some power to the solenoid , but not enough to hold the heavy contacts closed , so the starter motor itself never spins , and the engine fails to start these solenoids , whether axial or rotary , employ a flux carrying geometry that both produces a high starting force ( torque ) , and has a section that quickly begins to saturate magnetically this can be caused by a low or dead battery , by corroded or loose connections to the battery , or by a broken or damaged positive ( red ) cable from the battery
