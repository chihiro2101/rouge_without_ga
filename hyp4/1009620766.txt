globally , it is widespread in temperate regions marasmius oreades ( fairy ring champignon ) polyporus mylittae polyporus squamosus ( dryad 's saddle and pheasant 's back mushroom ) ramariaceae species ( coral fungus family ) rhizopogon luteolus russula , some members of this genus , such as r the species which can be identified '' in the field '' ( without use of special chemistry or a microscope ) and therefore safely eaten vary widely from country to country , even from region to region cantharellus cibarius ( the chanterelle ) , the yellow chanterelle is one of the best and most easily recognizable mushrooms , and can be found in asia , europe , north america and australia agaricus arvensis ( horse mushroom ) agaricus silvaticus ( pinewood mushroom ) amanita caesarea ( caesar 's mushroom ) armillaria mellea ( honey mushroom ) boletus badius ( bay bolete ) calocybe gambosa ( st george 's mushroom ) calvatia utriformis ( lycoperdon caelatum ) chroogomphus species ( pine-spikes or spike-caps ) clavariaceae species ( coral fungus family ) clavulinaceae species ( coral fungus family ) coprinus comatus , the shaggy mane , shaggy inkcap or lawyer 's wig they contain high levels ( 20 % or more of the daily value , dv ) of riboflavin , niacin , and pantothenic acid ( 24–33 % dv ) , with moderate content of phosphorus ( table ) commercial cultivation is important ecologically , as there have been concerns of depletion of larger fungi such as chanterelles in europe , possibly because the group has grown popular , yet remains a challenge to cultivate the ergocalciferol , vitamin d 2 , in uv-irradiated mushrooms is not the same vitamin d synthesis mechanism ( form 3 ) or animal skin , fur , or feathers ( cholecalciferol , vitamin d 3 ) mushrooms exposed to ultraviolet ( uv ) light produce vitamin d2 before or after harvest by converting ergosterol , a chemical found in large concentrations in mushrooms , to vitamin d 2 although cooking ( by boiling ) lowers mushroom water content only 1 % , the contents per 100 grams for several nutrients increase appreciably , especially for dietary minerals ( table for boiled mushrooms ) raw gyromitra are toxic due to the presence of gyromitrin , and it is not known whether all of the toxin can be removed by parboiling also known by names such as the '' chicken mushroom '' , '' chicken fungus '' , the sulphur shelf is a distinct bracket fungus popular among mushroom hunters gyromitra esculenta ( false morel - turban , brain mushroom ) is eaten by some after it has been parboiled , however , many mycologists do not recommend it the content of vitamin d is absent or low unless mushrooms are exposed to sunlight or purposely treated with artificial ultraviolet light ( see below ) , even after harvesting and processed into dry powder although vitamin d 2 clearly has vitamin d activity in humans and is widely used in food fortification and in dietary supplement , vitamin d 3 is more commonly used in dairy and cereal products . some of these species are harvested from the wild , and can be found in markets verpa bohemica is considered choice by some—it even can be found for sale as a '' morel '' —but cases of toxicity have been reported
