its editors sent a full team of reporters and artists to havana , including frederic remington , and hearst announced a reward of 50,000 '' for the conviction of the criminals who sent 258 american sailors to their deaths '' hearst 's sources never had to be specifically named because he just needed them to support the narrative that the explosion was caused by an attack by the spanish the spanish investigation found that the explosion had been caused by spontaneous combustion of the coal bunkers , but the sampson board ruled that the explosion had been caused by an external explosion from a torpedo the mckinley administration did not cite the explosion as a casus belli , but others were already inclined to go to war with spain over perceived atrocities and loss of control in cuba advocates of war used the rallying cry , '' remember the maine ! to hell with spain ! '' the spanish–american war began on april 21 , 1898 , two months after the sinking in addition to the inquiry commissioned by the spanish government to naval officers del peral and de salas , two naval courts of inquiry were ordered : the sampson board in 1898 and the vreeland board in 1911 all investigations agreed that an explosion of the forward magazines caused the destruction of the ship , but different conclusions were reached as to how the magazines could have exploded del peral and de salas identified the spontaneous combustion of the coal bunker , located adjacent to the munition stores in maine , as the likely cause of the explosion the wind and the waters were calm on that date and hence a mine could not have been detonated by contact , but only by using electricity , but no cables had been found in order to find the cause of the explosion , a naval inquiry was ordered by the united states shortly after the incident , headed by captain william t '' in a cable , the spanish minister of colonies , segismundo moret , had advised blanco '' to gather every fact you can , to prove the maine catastrophe can not be attributed to us the fact that the officer proposed to be court president was junior to the captain of maine , wegner writes , '' would indicate either ignorance of navy regulations or that , in the beginning , the board did not intend to examine the possibility that the ship was lost by accident and the negligence of her captain the sampson board produced its findings in two parts : the proceedings , which consisted mainly of testimonies , and the findings , which were the facts , as determined by the court between the proceedings and the findings , there was what wegner calls , '' a broad gap '' , where the court '' left no record of the reasoning that carried it from the often-inconsistent witnesses to its conclusion the board concluded that maine had been blown up by a mine , which , in turn , caused the explosion of her forward magazines the official report from the board , which was presented to the navy department in washington on 21 march , specifically stated the following : the fact that the cuban government wanted the wreck removed from havana harbor might also have played a role : it at least offered the opportunity to examine the wreck in greater detail than had been possible in 1898 , while simultaneously obliging the now-independent cubans wegner suggests that the fact that this inquiry could be held without the threat of war , which had been the case in 1898 , lent it the potential for greater objectivity than had been possible previously moreover , since several of the members of the 1910 board would be certified engineers , they would be better qualified to evaluate their findings than the line officers of the 1898 board had been the vreeland board also found that the bending of frame 18 was caused by the explosion of the magazines , not by the external explosion after the investigation , the newly located dead were buried in arlington national cemetery and the hollow , intact portion of the hull of maine was refloated and ceremoniously scuttled at sea on 16 march 1912 rickover became intrigued with the disaster and began a private investigation in 1974 , using information from the two official inquiries , newspapers , personal papers , and information on the construction and ammunition of maine he concluded that the explosion was not caused by a mine , and speculated that spontaneous combustion was the most likely cause , from coal in the bunker next to the magazine wegner says that all relevant documents were obtained and studied , including the ship 's plans and weekly reports of the unwatering of maine in 1912 ( the progress of the cofferdam ) written by william furgueson , chief engineer for the project wegner explains that anthracite coal is not subject to spontaneous combustion , but bituminous coal is considerably more volatile and is known for releasing the largest amounts of firedamp , a dangerous and explosive mixture of gases ( chiefly methane ) national geographic reported that '' a fire in the coal bunker could have generated sufficient heat to touch off an explosion in the adjacent magazine but on the other hand , computer analysis also shows that even a small , handmade mine could have penetrated the ship 's hull and set off explosions within '' the ame investigation noted that '' the size and location of the soil depression beneath the maine 'is more readily explained by a mine explosion than by magazine explosions alone ' '' the team noted that this was not '' definitive in proving that a mine was the cause of the sinking '' but it did '' strengthen the case '' it used photographic evidence , naval experts , and archival information to argue that the cause of the explosion was a coal bunker fire , and it identified a weakness or gap in the bulkhead separating the coal and powder bunkers that allowed the fire to spread from the former to the latter the maine monument in havana describes maines sailors as '' victims sacrificed to the imperialist greed in its fervor to seize control of cuba '' , which claims that u.s he offered the standard cuban interpretation in an interview to the new york times , but he adds that '' americans died for the freedom of cuba , and that should be recognized '' this claim has also been made in russia by mikhail khazin , a russian economist who once ran the cultural section at komsomolskaya pravda , and in spain by eric frattini , a spanish peruvian journalist in his book manipulando la historia on 9 may 1910 , congress authorized funds for the removal of the maine , the proper interment in arlington national cemetery of the estimated 70 bodies still inside , and the removal and transport of the main mast to arlington the ship forward of frame 41 was entirely destroyed ; a twisted mass of steel out of line with the rest of the hull , all that was left of the bow , bore no resemblance to a ship holes were cut in the bottom of the after-section , through which jets of water were pumped , to break the mud seal holding the ship , then plugged , with flood cocks , which would later be used for sinking the ship at 5pm local time , with a crowd of over 100,000 persons watching from the shore , her sea cocks were opened , and just over twenty minutes later , maine sank , bow first , in of water , to the sound of taps and the 21-gun salute of birmingham and north carolina in 2000 , the wreck of maine was rediscovered by advanced digital communications , a toronto-based expedition company , in about 3,770 feet ( 1,150 m ) of water roughly 3 miles ( 4.8 & nbsp ; km ) northeast of havana harbor the ship had been discovered east of where it was believed it had been scuttled ; according to the researchers , during the sinking ceremony and the time it took the wreck to founder , currents pushed maine east until it came to rest at its present location before the team identified the site as maine , they referred to the location as the '' square '' due to its unique shape , and at first they did not believe it was the ship , due to its unexpected location the expedition was able to identify the ship due to the doors and hatches on the wreck , as well as the anchor chain , the shape of the propellers , and the holes where the bow was cut off in 1926 , the cuban government erected a memorial to the victims of maine on the malecon , near the hotel nacional , to commemorate united states assistance in acquiring cuban independence from spain in 1898 , georges méliès made his movie , divers at work on the wreck of the '' maine '' , about rescuers freeing bodies from the sunken maine in 1914 , one of maines six anchors was taken from the washington navy yard to city park in reading , pennsylvania , and dedicated during a ceremony presided over by franklin d a 6-inch gun from maine is displayed on the front lawn of city hall in alpena , michigan , as well as a bronze plaque made from the vessel
