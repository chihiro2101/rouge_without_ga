these included a kindergarten on the roof of an apartment block in nantes ( rezé ) ( also : unité d'habitation of nantes-rezé ) , parts of government buildings in chandigarh , india , the '' undulatory glass surfaces '' of sainte marie de la tourette , a dominican priory in a valley near lyon , and the philips pavilion at expo 58—the latter project was completed by xenakis alone , from a basic sketch by le corbusier specific examples of mathematics , statistics , and physics applied to music composition are the use of the statistical mechanics of gases in pithoprakta , statistical distribution of points on a plane in diamorphoses , minimal constraints in achorripsis , the normal distribution in st/10 and atrées , markov chains in analogique , game theory in duel , stratégie , and linaia-agon , group theory in nomos alpha ( for siegfried palm ) , set theory in herma and eonta , chrissochoidis , ilias , stavros houliaras , and christos mitsakis '' service described xenakis as a composer '' whose craggily , joyously elemental music turned collections of pitches and rhythms and instruments into a force of nature , releasing a power that previous composers had only suggested metaphorically but which he would realise with arguably greater clarity , ferocity , intensity than any musician , before or since , '' and suggested that his music is '' expressive : not in a conventionally emotional way , perhaps , but it has an ecstatic , cathartic power a collection of texts on applications of stochastic processes , game theory and computer programming in music , it was later revised , expanded and translated into english as formalized music : thought and mathematics in composition ( 1971 ) during xenakis 's tenure at indiana university in 1999 , xenakis was awarded the polar music prize '' for a long succession of forceful works , charged with sensitivity , commitment and passion , through which he has come to rank among the most central composers of our century in the realm of art music , exercising within its various fields an influence which can not be readily overstated '' xenakis 's compositions from 1949–52 were mostly inspired by greek folk melodies , as well as bartók , ravel , and others ; after studying with messiaen , he discovered serialism and gained a deep understanding of contemporary music ( messiaen 's other pupils at the time included , for example , karlheinz stockhausen and jean barraqué ) '' tom service praised xenakis ' music for its '' shattering visceral power '' and '' sheer , scintillating physicality '' , noting its '' deep , primal rootedness in richer and older phenomena even than musical history : the physics and patterning of the natural world , of the stars , of gas molecules , and the proliferating possibilities of mathematical principles important works in this medium include concret ph ( 1958 ) , analogique b ( 1958–59 ) , bohor ( 1962 ) , la légende d'eer ( 1977 ) , mycenae-alpha ( 1978 ) , voyage absolu des unari vers andromède ( 1989 ) , gendy301 ( 1991 ) , and s709 ( 1994 ) in the same year he produced a musique concrète piece , concret ph , for the philips pavilion , and , in 1960 , xenakis was well-known enough to receive a commission from unesco , for a soundtrack for a documentary film by enrico fulchignoni in a late interview , xenakis admitted to feeling tremendous guilt at leaving his country , and that guilt was one of the sources of his later devotion to music : for years i was tormented by guilt at having left the country for which i 'd fought xenakis , who was by that time well acquainted with music of debussy , béla bartók , and stravinsky , all of whom used such devices and much more experimental ones , was furious and left to study with darius milhaud , but these lessons also proved fruitless after leaving le corbusier 's studio in 1959 , xenakis supported himself by composition and teaching , and quickly became recognized as one of the most important european composers of his time he became especially known for his musical research in the field of computer-assisted composition , for which he founded the equipe de mathématique et automatique musicales ( emamu ) in 1966 ( known as cemamu : centre d ’ etudes de mathématique et automatique musicales , since 1972 ) the third part of the triptych , metastaseis , is generally regarded as the composer 's first mature piece ; it was detached from the triptych to mark the beginning of the '' official '' xenakis oeuvre hoffmann the experience xenakis gained played a major role in his music : important early compositions such as metastaseis ( 1953–54 ) were based directly on architectural concepts xenakis also developed an stochastic synthesizer algorithm ( used in gendy ) , called dynamic stochastic synthesis , where a polygonal waveform 's sectional borders ' amplitudes and distance between borders may be generated using a form of random walk to create both aleatoric timbres and musical forms elastic barriers or mirrors are used to keep the randomly generated values within a given finite interval , so as to not exceed limits such as the audible pitch range , avoid complete chaos ( white noise ) , and to create a balance between stability and instability ( unity and variety ) although scherchen did not premiere that particular work , he did give performances of later pieces by xenakis , and the relationship between the conductor and the composer was of vital importance for the latter zbigniew skowron , describing aïs , wrote '' in accordance with his atheist views , xenakis emphasizes the finality of death as the ultimate event of human life , and this is probably why wild shrieks and moans punctuate his score '' messiaen 's modal serialism was an influence on xenakis 's first large-scale work , anastenaria ( 1953–54 ) : a triptych for choir and orchestra based on an ancient dionysus ritual after the axis forces left , churchill ordered that british forces step in to help restore the greek monarchy ; they were opposed by the democratic army of greece , and the country plunged into a civil war he was subsequently educated by a series of governesses , and then , in 1932 , sent to a boarding school on the aegean island of spetses , greece xenakis joined the national liberation front early during the war , participating in mass protests and demonstrations , and later becoming part of armed resistance—this last step was a painful experience xenakis refused to discuss until much later in life her early death , when xenakis was five years old , was a traumatic experience that , in his own words , '' deeply scarred '' the future composer xenakis frequently gave lectures ( for instance , from 1975 to 1978 he was professor of music at gresham college , london , giving free public lectures ) , cole , jonathan 2009 gresham college ( 21 september , archive from 18 january 2015 , accessed 29 april 2016 ) taught composition , and his works were performed at numerous festivals worldwide , including the shiraz arts festival in iran despite xenakis 's reputation as a '' mathematical '' composer , his works are known for their power and physicality
