the rhine campaign of 1795 ( april 1795 to january 1796 ) opened when two habsburg armies under the overall command of françois sébastien charles joseph de croix , count of clerfayt defeated an attempt by two republican french armies to cross the rhine river and capture the fortress of mainz at the start of the campaign the french army of the sambre and meuse led by jean-baptiste jourdan confronted clerfayt 's army of the lower rhine in the north , while the french army of rhine and moselle under pichegru lay opposite dagobert sigmund von wurmser 's army in the south with pichegru unexpectedly inactive , clerfayt massed against jourdan , beat him at höchst in october and forced most of the army of the sambre and meuse to retreat to the west bank of the rhine with jourdan temporarily out of the picture , the austrians defeated the left wing of the army of rhine and moselle at the battle of mainz and moved down the west bank ramsay weston phipps , the armies of the first french republic : volume ii the armées du moselle , du rhin , de sambre-et-meuse , de rhin-et-moselle , us , pickle partners publishing , 2011 ( 1923 & ndash ;

ecclesiastical territories , also of varying sizes and influence , such as the wealthy abbey of reichenau and the powerful archbishopric of cologne ; and dynastic states such as württemberg the armies of the first coalition included the contingents and the infantry and cavalry of the various states , amounted to about 125,000 troops ( including the three autonomous corps ) , a sizable force by eighteenth century standards but a moderate force by the standards of the revolutionary wars habsburg troops comprised the bulk of the army but the thin white line of habsburg infantry could not cover the territory from basel to frankfurt with sufficient depth to resist the pressure of the opposition furthermore , he had concentrated the bulk of his force , commanded by count baillet latour , between karlsruhe and darmstadt , where the confluence of the rhine and the main made an attack most likely , as it offered a gateway into eastern german states and ultimately to vienna , with good bridges crossing a relatively well-defined river bank in spring 1796 , drafts from the free imperial cities , and other imperial states in the swabian and franconian circles augmented the habsburg force with perhaps 20,000 men at the most consequently , in may and early june , when the french started to mass troops by mainz and it looked as if the bulk of the french army would cross there—they even engaged the imperial force at altenkirchen ( 4 june ) and wetzler and uckerath ( 15 june ) —charles felt few qualms placing the 7000-man swabian militia at the crossing by kehl an assault into the german states was essential , as far as french commanders understood , not only in terms of war aims , but also in practical terms : the french directory believed that war should pay for itself , and did not budget for the feeding of its troops the 20,000-man right wing under duke ferdinand frederick augustus of württemberg stood on the east bank of the rhine behind the sieg river , observing the french bridgehead at düsseldorf its right wing occupied kaiserslautern on the west bank while the left wing under anton sztáray , michael von fröhlich and louis joseph , prince of condé guarded the rhine from mannheim to switzerland on the french side , the 80,000-man army of sambre-et-meuse held the west bank of the rhine down to the nahe and then southwest to sankt wendel the right wing of the army of the rhine and moselle , under jean victor moreau 's command , was positioned east of the rhine from hüningen ( on the border with the french provinces , switzerland , and the german states ) northward , with its center along the queich river near landau and its left wing extended west toward saarbrücken pierre marie barthélemy ferino commanded moreau 's right wing at hüningen , louis desaix commanded the center and laurent gouvion saint-cyr directed the left wing and included two divisions commanded by guillaume philibert duhesme , and alexandre camille taponier specifically , jean-baptiste jourdan 's army would push south from düsseldorf , hopefully drawing troops and attention toward themselves , which would allow moreau ’ s army an easier crossing of the rhine and huningen and kehl once charles moved the mass of his army to the north , moreau ’ s army , which early in the year had been stationed by speyer , would move swiftly south to strasbourg in the south , by basel , ferino ’ s column was to move speedily across the river and advanced up the rhine along the swiss and german shoreline , toward lake constance and spread into the southern end of the black forest ideally , this would encircle and trap charles and his army as the left wing of moreau 's army swung behind him , and as jourdan 's force cut off his flank with wartensleben 's autonomous corps military historians usually maintain that napoleon solidified the use of the autonomous corps , armies that could function without a great deal of direction , scatter about the countryside , but reform again quickly for battle ; this was actually a development that first emerged first in the french and indian war in the thirteen colonies and later in the american revolutionary war , and became widely used in the european military as the size of armies grew in the 1790s and during the napoleonic wars responding to the french feint , charles committed most of his forces on the middle and northern rhine , leaving only the swabian militia at the kehl-strasbourg crossing , and a minor force commanded by karl aloys zu fürstenberg at rastatt in addition , a small force of about 5,000 french royalists under the command of the louis joseph , prince of condé , supposedly covering the rhine from switzerland to freiburg im breisgau once charles committed his main army to the mid and northern rhine , however , moreau executed an about face , and a forced march with most his army and arrived at strasburg before charles realized the french had even left speyer on 20 june , his troops assaulted the forward posts between strasbourg and the river , overwhelming the pickets there ; the militia withdrew to kehl , leaving behind their cannons , which solved part of moreau 's artillery problem at hüningen , near basel , on the same day that moreau 's advance guard crossed at kehl , pierre marie barthélemy ferino executed a full crossing , and advanced unopposed east along the german shore of the rhine , with the 16th and 50th demi-brigades , the 68th , 50th and 68th line infantry , and six squadrons of cavalry that included the 3rd and 7th hussars and the 10th dragoons 153 & ndash ;
