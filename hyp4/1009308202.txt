adam smith , in his seminal work the wealth of nations , described wealth as '' the annual produce of the land and labour of the society '' in popular usage , wealth can be described as an abundance of items of economic value , or the state of controlling or possessing such items , usually in the form of money , real estate and personal property in economics , net worth refers to the value of assets owned minus the value of liabilities owed at a point in time wealth can be categorized into three principal categories : personal property , including homes or automobiles ; monetary savings , such as the accumulation of past income ; and the capital wealth of income producing assets , including real estate , stocks , bonds , and businesses wealth provides a type of individual safety net of protection against an unforeseen decline in one 's living standard in the event of job loss or other emergency and can be transformed into home ownership , business ownership , or even a college education when a desirable or valuable commodity ( transferable good or skill ) is abundantly available to everyone , the owner of the commodity will possess no potential for wealth this comparative wealth across time is also applicable to the future ; given this trend of human advancement , it is possible that the standard of living that the wealthiest enjoy today will be considered impoverished by future generations however , physical capital , as it came to be known , consisting of both the natural capital and the infrastructural capital , became the focus of the analysis of wealth adam smith saw wealth creation as the combination of materials , labour , land , and technology in such a way as to capture a profit ( excess above the cost of production ) an inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations the theories of david ricardo , john locke , john stuart mill , in the 18th century and 19th century built on these views of wealth that we now call classical economics marxian economics ( see labor theory of value ) distinguishes in the grundrisse between material wealth and human wealth , defining human wealth as '' wealth in human relations '' ; land and labour were the source of all material wealth having a leading position in the development of rational sciences , in new technologies and in economic production leads to wealth , while the opposite can be correlated with poverty in western civilization , wealth is connected with a quantitative type of thought , invented in the ancient greek '' revolution of rationality '' , involving for instance the quantitative analysis of nature , the rationalization of warfare , and measurement in economics aristotle describes the basic function of money as a universal instrument of quantitative measurement '' for it measures all things … '' making things alike and comparable due to a social '' agreement '' of acceptance in that way , money also enables a new type of economic society and the definition of wealth in measurable quantities , such as gold and money in economics , wealth ( in a commonly applied accounting sense , sometimes savings ) is the net worth of a person , household , or nation – that is , the value of all assets owned net of all liabilities owed at a point in time wealth or savings is a stock variable – that is , it is measurable at a date in time , for example the value of an orchard on december 31 minus debt owed on the orchard for a given amount of wealth , say at the beginning of the year , income from that wealth , as measurable over say a year is a flow variable one feature of its effect on economic behavior is the wealth elasticity of demand , which is the percentage change in the amount of consumption goods demanded for each one-percent change in wealth wealth may be measured in nominal or real values – that is , in money value as of a given date or adjusted to net out price changes environmental or green accounting is a method of national accounts for formulating and deriving such measures on the argument that an educated valuation is superior to a value of zero ( as the implied valuation of environmental assets ) social class is not identical to wealth , but the two concepts are related ( particularly in marxist theory ) , leading to the combined concept of socioeconomic status in 1996 , the united states federal government reported that the net worth of the top 1 percent of people in the united states was approximately equal to that of the bottom 90 percent upper class values include higher education , and for the wealthiest people the accumulation and maintenance of wealth , the maintenance of social networks and the power that accompanies such networks it is in large part by accessing various edifices of information , associates , procedures and auspices that the upper class are able to maintain their wealth and pass it to future generations although precise data are not available , the total household wealth in the world , excluding human capital , has been estimated at 125 trillion ( us 125×10 12 ) in year 2000 in the western tradition , the concepts of owning land and accumulating wealth in the form of land were engendered in the rise of the first state , for a primary service and power of government was , and is to this day , the awarding and adjudication of land use rights he claimed that because we mix our labour with the land , we thereby deserve the right to control the use of the land and benefit from the product of that land ( but subject to his lockean proviso of '' at least where there is enough , and as good left in common for others additionally , in developed countries post-agrarian society ( industrial society ) this argument has many critics ( including those influenced by georgist and geolibertarian ideas ) who argue that since land , by definition , is not a product of human labor , any claim of private property in it is a form of theft ; as david lloyd george observed , '' to prove a legal title to land one must trace it back to the man who stole it anthropology characterizes societies , in part , based on a society 's concept of wealth , and the institutional structures and power used to protect this wealth but as tools , clothing , and other mobile infrastructural capital became important to survival ( especially in hostile biomes ) , ideas such as the inheritance of wealth , political positions , leadership , and ability to control group movements ( to perhaps reinforce such power ) emerged protection of infrastructural capital built up over generations became critical : city walls , irrigation systems , sewage systems , aqueducts , buildings , all impossible to replace within a single generation , and thus a matter of social survival to maintain however , physical capital , as it came to be known , consisting of both the natural capital ( raw materials from nature ) and the infrastructural capital ( facilitating technology ) , became the focus of the analysis of wealth adam smith saw wealth creation as the combination of materials , labour , land , and technology in such a way as to capture a profit ( excess above the cost of production )
