it is the ratio of the number of units of a given country 's currency necessary to buy a market basket of goods in the other country , after acquiring the other country 's currency in the foreign exchange market , to the number of units of the given country 's currency that would be necessary to buy that market basket directly in the given country for example , the purchasing power of the us dollar relative to that of the euro is the dollar price of a euro ( dollars per euro ) times the euro price of one unit of the market basket ( euros/goods unit ) divided by the dollar price of the market basket ( dollars per goods unit ) , and hence is dimensionless the rate of change of the real exchange rate over time for the euro versus the dollar equals the rate of appreciation of the euro ( the positive or negative percentage rate of change of the dollars-per-euro exchange rate ) plus the inflation rate of the euro minus the inflation rate of the dollar government market intervention : when exchange rate fluctuations in the foreign exchange market adversely affect a country 's economy , trade , or the government needs to achieve certain policy goals through exchange rate adjustments , monetary authorities can participate in currency trading , buying or selling local or foreign currencies in large quantities in the market quotation using a country 's home currency as the price currency is known as direct quotation or price quotation ( from that country 's perspective ) for example , eur 0.8989 usd 1.00 in the eurozone understanding foreign exchange : exchange rates and is used in most countries ; according to the international exchange rate regime : fixed exchange rate : it means that the exchange rate between a country 's currency and another country 's currency is basically fixed , and the fluctuation of exchange rate is very small ; according to the payment method in foreign exchange transactions : telegraphic exchange rate mail transfer rate demand draft rate ; according to the level of foreign exchange controls : official rate : the official exchange rate is the rate of exchange announced by a country 's foreign exchange administration in general , the exchange rate where the foreign currency is converted to a smaller number of domestic currencies is the buying rate , which indicates how much the country 's currency is required to buy a certain amount of foreign exchange economic strength of a country : in general , high economic growth rates are not conducive to the local currency 's performance in the foreign exchange market in the short term , but in the long run , they strongly support the strong momentum of the local currency quotation using a country 's home currency as the unit currency ( for example , us 1.11 eur 1.00 in the eurozone ) is known as indirect quotation or quantity quotation and is used in british newspapers ; it is also common in australia , new zealand and the eurozone in our example , the forward exchange rate of the dollar is said to be at a discount because it buys fewer japanese yen in the forward rate than it does in the spot rate ; from the perspective of bank foreign exchange trading : buying rate : also known as the purchase price , it is the price used by the foreign exchange bank to buy foreign currency from the customer according to this view the ability of emerging market economies to compete is weakened because many of the currencies are tied to the us dollar in various fashions either implicitly or explicitly , so fluctuations such as the appreciation of the us dollar to the yen or deutsche mark have contributed to destabilizing shocks when a country raises its interest rate or its domestic interest rate is higher than the foreign interest rate , it will cause capital inflow , thereby increasing the demand for domestic currency , allowing the currency to appreciate and the foreign exchange depreciate balance of payments : when a country has a large international balance of payments deficit or trade deficit , it means that its foreign exchange earnings are less than foreign exchange expenditures and its demand for foreign exchange exceeds its supply , so its foreign exchange rate rises , and its currency depreciates floating exchange rate : it means that the monetary authorities of a country do not stipulate the official exchange rate of the country 's currency against other currencies , nor does it have any upper or lower limit of exchange rate fluctuations two of the most popular approaches in the economic literature are the fundamental equilibrium exchange rate ( feer ) , developed by williamson ( 1994 ) , and the behavioural equilibrium exchange rate ( beer ) , initially estimated by clark and macdonald ( 1998 ) for example , in a conversion from eur to aud , eur is the fixed currency , aud is the variable currency and the exchange rate indicates how many australian dollars would be paid or received for 1 euro venture capital : if speculators expect a certain currency to appreciate , they will buy a large amount of that currency , which will cause the exchange rate of that currency to rise forward exchange rate : to be delivered in a certain period of time in the future , but beforehand , the buyer and the seller will enter into a contract to reach an agreement a lower exchange rate lowers the price of a country 's goods for consumers in other countries , but raises the price of imported goods and services for consumers in the low value currency country bilateral exchange rate involves a currency pair , while an trade weighted index is a weighted average of a basket of foreign currencies , and it can be viewed as an overall measure of the country 's external competitiveness the real exchange rate ( rer ) represents the nominal exchange rate adjusted by the relative price of domestic and foreign goods and services , thus reflecting the competitiveness of a country with respect to the rest of the world selling rate : also known as the foreign exchange selling price , it refers to the exchange rate used by the bank to sell foreign exchange to customers if all goods were freely tradable , and foreign and domestic residents purchased identical baskets of goods , purchasing power parity ( ppp ) would hold for the exchange rate and gdp deflators ( price levels ) of the two countries , and the real exchange rate would always equal 1 in some areas of europe and in the retail market in the united kingdom , eur and gbp are reversed so that gbp is quoted as the fixed currency to the euro forward foreign exchange trading is an appointment-based transaction , which is due to the different time the foreign exchange purchaser needs for foreign exchange funds and the introduction of foreign exchange risk '' china denies currency undervalued '' article on bbc news on sunday , 14 march 2010 other nations , including iceland , japan , brazil , and so on have had a policy of maintaining a low value of their currencies in the hope of reducing the cost of exports and thus bolstering their economies a country may gain an advantage in international trade if it market manipulation for its currency to keep its value low , typically by the national central bank engaging in open market operations in the foreign exchange market if us interest rates increase while japanese interest rates remain unchanged then the us dollar should depreciate against the japanese yen by an amount that prevents arbitrage ( in reality the opposite , appreciation , quite frequently happens in the short-term , as explained below ) the exchange rate that is generally listed on the foreign exchange market is generally referred to as the spot exchange rate unless it specifically indicates the forward exchange rate the forward exchange rate is based on the spot exchange rate , which is represented by the “ premium ” , “ discount ” , and “ parity ” of the spot exchange rate ; according to the method of setting the exchange rate : basic rate : usually choose a key convertible currency that is the most commonly used in international economic transactions and accounts for the largest proportion of foreign exchange reserves this is the exchange rate ( expressed as dollars per euro ) times the relative price of the two currencies in terms of their ability to purchase units of the market basket ( euros per goods unit divided by dollars per goods unit ) the controls were rolled back after macri took office and argentina issued dollar denominated bonds , but when various factors led to a loss in the value of the peso relative to the dollar leading to the restoration of capital controls to prevent additional depreciation amidst peso selloffs cross rate : after the basic exchange rate is worked out , the exchange rate of the local currency against other foreign currencies can be calculated through the basic exchange rate
