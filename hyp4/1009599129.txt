they have been extensively studied because of their medical , veterinary , and economic importances , because the flies can be raised in a laboratory , and because they are relatively large , facilitating their analysis a project that was implemented from 1994 to 1997 on the island of unguja , zanzibar ( united republic of tanzania ) , demonstrated that , after suppression of the tsetse population with insecticides , sit completely removed the glossina austeni newstead population from the island the species trypanosoma brucei , which causes the disease , has often been subdivided into three subspecies that were identified based either on the vertebrate hosts which the strain could infect or on the virulence of the disease in humans other forms of animal trypanosomiasis are also known from other areas of the globe , caused by different species of trypanosomes and transmitted without the intervention of the tsetse fly the most notable is american trypanosomiasis , known as chagas disease , which occurs in south america , caused by trypanosoma cruzi , and transmitted by certain insects of the reduviidae , members of the hemiptera tsetse flies have an arsenal of immune defenses to resist each stage of the trypanosome infectious cycle , and thus are relatively refractory to trypanosome infection among the host flies ' defenses is the production of hydrogen peroxide , a reactive oxygen species that damages dna the entire target area ( block 1 , 2 and 3 ) has a total surface of 1000 km2 , and the first block ( northern part ) can be considered free of tsetse , as intensive monitoring has failed to detect since 2012 a single wild tsetse fly agriculture ( measured by the usage of large domesticated animals , intensive agriculture , plow use and female participation rate in agriculture ) as well as institutions ( measured by the appearance of indigenous slavery and levels of centralization ) would have been more like those found in eurasia for example , the island of principe off the west coast of africa was entirely cleared of feral pigs in the 1930s , which led to the extirpation of the fly some scientists put forward the idea that zebra have stripes , not as a camouflage in long grass , but because the black and white bands tend to confuse tsetse and prevent attack the eradication of the tsetse fly from unguja island in 1997 was followed by the disappearance of the aat which enabled farmers to integrate livestock keeping with cropping in areas where this had been impossible before the use of chemicals as attractants to lure tsetse to the traps has been studied extensively in the late 20th century , but this has mostly been of interest to scientists rather than as an economically reasonable solution four characteristics definitively separate adult tsetse from other kinds of flies : the infection progresses into the blood stream and eventually crosses into the central nervous system and invades the brain leading to extreme lethargy and eventually to death the adults are relatively large flies , with lengths of , and have a recognizable shape or bauplan which makes them easy to distinguish from other flies in the niayes region of senegal , a coastal area close to dakar , livestock keeping was difficult due to the presence of a population of glossina palpalis gambiensis hale carpenter joined the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine , and took the dm in 1913 with a dissertation on the tsetse fly ( glossina palpalis ) and sleeping sickness feasibility studies indicated that the fly population was confined to very fragmented habitats and a population genetics study indicated that the population was genetically isolated from the main tsetse belt in the south eastern part of senegal therefore , the integration of the sit as the last component of an area-wide integrated approach is essential in many situations to achieve complete eradication of the different tsetse populations , particularly in areas of more dense vegetation tsetse fly eradication programmes are complex and logistically demanding activities and usually involve the integration of different control tactics , such as trypanocidal drugs , impregnated treated targets ( itt ) , insecticide-treated cattle ( itc ) , aerial spraying ( sequential aerosol technique - sat ) and in some situations the release of sterile males ( sterile insect technique â€“ sit ) the sustainable removal of the tsetse fly is in many cases the most cost-effective way of dealing with the t & t problem resulting in major economic benefits for subsistence farmers in rural areas attractants studied have been those tsetse might use to find food , like carbon dioxide , octenol , and acetone & mdash ; which are given off in animals ' breath and distributed downwind in an odor plume a special trapping method is applied in ethiopia , where the biofarm consortium ( icipe , biovision foundation , bea , helvetas , dlco-ea , praxis ethiopia ) applies the traps in a sustainable agriculture and rural development context ( sard ) the conquest of sleeping sickness and nagana would be of immense benefit to rural development and contribute to poverty alleviation and improved food security in sub-saharan africa pesticides have been used to control tsetse starting initially during the early part of the twentieth century in localized efforts using the inorganic metal-based pesticides , expanding after the second world war into massive aerial- and ground-based campaigns with organochlorine pesticides such as ddt applied as aerosol sprays at ultra-low volume rates , great zimbabwe is located in the african highlands where the fly does not occur , and represented the largest and technically most advanced precolonial structure in sub-sahara africa
