christopher dresser , a student and later professor at the school worked with owen jones on the grammar of ornament , as well as on the 1863 decoration of the oriental courts ( chinese , japanese , and indian ) at the south kensington museum , advanced the search for a new style with his two publications the art of decorative design 1862 , and principles of design 1873 like contemporary art , shindler writes that aestheticism was born of '' the conundrum of constituting one ’ s life in relation to an exterior work '' and that it '' attempted to overcome '' this problem '' by subsuming artists within their work in the hope of yielding—more than mere objects—lives which could be living artworks in this lecture wilde exposited the principles of the aesthetic movement in decorative and applied design , also known at the time as the '' ornamental aesthetic '' style , according to which local flora and fauna were celebrated as beautiful and textured , layered ceilings were popular there are a few significant continuities between the pre-raphaelite philosophy and that of the aesthetes : dedication to the idea of ‘ art for art ’ s sake ’ ; admiration of , and constant striving for , beauty ; escapism through visual and literary arts ; craftsmanship that is both careful and self-conscious ; mutual interest in merging the arts of various media however , their approach to aestheticism did not share the creed of ‘ art for art ’ s sake ’ but rather “ a spirited reassertion of those principles of colour , beauty , love , and cleanness that the drab , agitated , discouraging world of the mid-nineteenth century needed so much the maxim '' art for art 's sake , '' identifying art or beauty as the primary element in other branches of the aesthetic movement , especially fine art , can not apply in this context owen jones , architect and orientalist , was requested to set out key principles of design and these became not only the basis of the schools teaching but also the propositions which preface the grammar of ornament ( 1856 ) , which is still regarded as the finest systematic study or practical sourcebook of historic world ornament some claim that it was invented by the philosopher victor cousin , although angela leighton in the publication on form : poetry , aestheticism and the legacy of a word ( 2007 ) notes that the phrase was used by benjamin constant as early as 1804 however , according to michael shindler , the decorative art branch of the aesthetic movement , was less the utilitarian cousin of aestheticism 's main 'pure ' branch , and more the very means by which aesthetes exercised their fundamental design strategy image : design for an aesthetic theatrical poster.png thumb left 300px one of many punch cartoons about æsthetes the artists and writers of aesthetic style tended to profess that the arts should provide refined sensuous pleasure , rather than convey moral or sentimental messages jones identified the need for a new and modern style that would meet the requirements of the modern world , rather than the continual re-cycling of historic styles , but saw no reason to reject the lessons of the past writers of the decadent movement used the slogan '' art for art 's sake '' ( l'art pour l'art ) , the origin of which is debated since the aesthetic movement was only prevalent in the decorative arts from about 1880 until about 1890 , there are not many surviving examples of this particular style but one such example is 18 stafford terrace , london , which provides an insight into how the middle classes interpreted its principles as a consequence , they did not accept john ruskin , matthew arnold , and george macdonald 's conception of art as something moral or useful , '' art for truth 's sake '' although the work of edward burne-jones was exhibited at the grosvenor gallery which promoted the movement , it is narrative and conveys moral or sentimental messages hence falling outside the movement 's purported programme the british decadent writers were much influenced by the oxford professor walter pater and his essays published during 1867–68 , in which he stated that life had to be lived intensely , with an ideal of beauty
