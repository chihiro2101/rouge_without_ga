felt is used in a wide range of industries and manufacturing processes , from the automotive industry and casinos to musical instruments and home construction , as well as in gun wadding , either inside cartridges or pushed down the barrel of a muzzleloader in the western world , felt is widely used as a medium for expression in both textile art and contemporary art and design , where it has significance as an ecologically responsible textile and building material felt is frequently used in industry as a sound or vibration damper , as a non-woven fabric for air filtration , and in machinery for cushioning and padding moving parts felt is used extensively in pianos ; for example , piano hammers are made of wool felt around a wooden core however , the importance of felting to community life can be seen in the fact that , in many central asian communities , felt production , is directed by a leader who oversees the process as a ritual that includes prayers—words and actions to bring good luck to the process small felt cutouts or figures of animals , people , or other objects will adhere to a felt board , and in the process of telling the story , the storyteller also acts it out on the board with the animals or people thumb in the wet felting process , hot water is applied to layers of animal hairs , while repeated agitation and compression causes the fibers to hook together or weave together into a single piece of fabric the special needles used to make 3d sculpture , jewelry , adornments and 2d art have notches along the shaft of the needle that catch fibers and tangle them with other fibers to produce felt most types of wool , such as those taken from the alpaca or the merino sheep , can be put through the wet felting process in central asia , it is common to conduct the rolling/friction process with the aid of a horse , donkey , or camel , which will pull the rolled felt until the process is complete as part of the overall renewal of interest in textile and fiber arts , beginning in the 1970s and continuing through today , felt has experienced a strong revival in interest , including its historical roots successfully completing the creation of felt ( certainly large felt pieces ) is reason for celebration , feasting , and the sharing of traditional stories a wire armature can be created to help the process and provide support , around which a needle felted body and coat can be added this may be the origin of the phrase '' mad as a hatter '' which was used to humorous effect by lewis carroll in the chapter '' a mad tea party '' of the novel alice in wonderland feltmaking is still practised by nomadic peoples ( such as mongols and turkic people ) in central asia , where rugs , tents and clothing are regularly made in order to make multi-colored designs , felters conduct a two-step process in which they create pre-felts of specialized colors—these semi-completed sheets of colored felt can then be cut with a sharp implement ( knife or scissors ) and the distinctive colors placed next to each other as in making a mosaic felt is placed under the piano keys on accordions to control touch and key noise ; it is also used on the pallets to silence notes not sounded by preventing air flow needles used for crafting are often very thin needles , sometimes fitted in holders that allow the user to utilize 2 or more needles at one time to sculpt wool objects and shapes exploitation of these characteristics of the fleece in tandem with the use of other techniques , such as stitching and incorporation of other fibers , provides felters with a broad range of possibilities felt is used with other instruments , particularly stringed instruments , as a damper to reduce volume or eliminate unwanted sounds in order to strengthen the joints of a mosaic style felt , feltmakers often add a backing layer of fleece that is felted along with the other components some of these are traditional items , such as the classic yurt ( gers ) , while others are designed for the tourist market , such as decorated slippers the single thin needles are used for detail and the multiple needles that are paired together are used for larger areas or to form the base of the project
