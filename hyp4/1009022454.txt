'' bulgareasca/bulgarish/bulgar : the transformation of a klezmer dance genre '' by walter zev feldman in american klezmer p.84 much of the traditional klezmer repertoire was created by professional klezmer musicians in the style of their region or tradition , and much co-territorial music such as non-jewish folksongs , especially romanian music ( mainly from moldavia ) , as well as ukrainian music and ottoman music , and the musics of other minorities living in the same areas as jews in southeastern europe such as crimean tatars as jews left eastern europe and the shtetls ( see a related article about the artist chaim goldberg , who depicted klezmer performers of the shtetl in his paintings ) , klezmer spread throughout the globe , to the united states as well as to canada , mexico , and argentina in the 1920s , clarinetists dave tarras and naftule brandwein caused a brief , influential revival , but hankus netsky has noted that '' few of the performers of this era actually referred to themselves as klezmorim , and the term is found nowhere in any jewish instrumental recording of the time yidl mitn fidl ( 1936 ) , directed by joseph green oliver !

notably making several recordings with columbia records and appearing often at carnegie hall and other major venues in the u.s mames babegenush was formed in copenhagen , denmark , in 2004 out of strong scandinavian roots merged with traditional klezmer , influenced on the klezmer side by masters like naftule brandwein , abe schwartz and dave tarras it is unlikely that they played music recognizable as klezmer today since the style and structure of klezmer as we know it today is thought to have come largely from 19th century bessarabia , where the bulk of today 's traditional repertoire was written some clarinet stylings of swing jazz bandleaders benny goodman and artie shaw can be interpreted as having been derived from klezmer , as can the '' freilach swing '' playing of other jewish artists of the period such as trumpeter ziggy elman most klezmer pieces are for dancing to , from fast to slow tempo : freylekhs ( also bulgar , bulgarish & nbsp ; – literally '' bulgarian '' , volekhl/vulekhl & nbsp ; – literally '' wallachian '' , or '' romanian '' ) is an ( divided ) circle dance , usually in the ahava rabboh melodic mode the 1980s saw a second wave of revival , as interest grew in more traditionally inspired performances with string instruments , largely with non-jews of the united states and germany the following are the names of these modes ; the names are taken from the names of familiar prayers that use that mode ( imagine an american composer referring to a piece as '' a grand old flag '' instead of as '' a march '' ) however , there were several times in history where this transmission broke down , including mass emigration , but especially the holocaust , which destroyed most of jewish life and culture in europe when used in combination with the ahavoh rabboh scale in the same piece ( as in mayn shtetl yas ) , the mi shebeirach section is usually a whole tone below the ahavoh rabboh scale ( for example , d ahavoh rabboh changes to c mi shebeirach or vice versa ) instrumental tunes often follow the types of chord progressions found in middle eastern and greek music , whereas vocal yiddish songs are often much simpler , and follow a style and chord progressions similar to russian folk songs therefore , instruments held in the hands ( clarinet , violin , trumpet , flute ) or supported by a neck or shoulder strap ( accordion , cimbalom , drum ) were favored over those that rested on the ground ( cello , bass violin ) , or needed several people to move ( piano ) klezmer musicians heard and adapted traditional romanian music , which is reflected in the dance forms found throughout surviving klezmer music repertoire ( e.g musicians began to track down older european klezmer , by listening to recordings , finding transcriptions , and making field recordings of the few klezmorim left in eastern europe the melody is generally assigned to the lead violin , while the other instrumentalists provide harmony , rhythm , and some counterpoint ( the latter usually coming from the second violin or viola ) jews began to adopt mainstream culture , the popularity of klezmer waned , and jewish celebrations were increasingly accompanied by non-jewish music undoubtedly , much has been lost of the repertoires played in various locations and social contexts—especially wedding repertoire , since although jewish weddings could last several days , early recording technology could only capture a few minutes at a time interest in klezmer has been sustained and supported by such well-known avant-garde jazz musicians as john zorn and don byron , who sometimes blend klezmer with jazz the term klezmer comes from a combination of hebrew words : klei , meaning '' tools , utensils or instruments of '' and zemer , '' melody '' ; leading to k'lei zemer , literally '' instruments of music '' or '' musical instruments '' the bible has several descriptions of orchestras and levites making music , but after the destruction of the second temple in 70 ce , many rabbis discouraged musical instruments typically it is performed on violin , cymbalom or clarinet , though it has been done on banjo , xylophone , flute , cornet , saxophone , tuba , and many other instruments these were extremely popular around the world in the 1930s , and many eastern european tangos were originally written by jews performers in this style include the klezmorim , the klezmatics , the klezmer conservatory band , and the maxwell street klezmer band a few older klezmorim—such as leon schwartz , dave tarras , and german goldenshtayn—survived into the klezmer revival era and could recall some forgotten repertoire much of klezmer music uses the ahavah rabboh scale ( such as nigun rikud , tish nigun and numerous freylekhs ) , although mi sheberach is prevalent as well
