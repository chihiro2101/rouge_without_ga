in old russian , the term samoyed was often applied indiscriminately to different peoples of northern russia who speak related uralic languages : nenets , nganasans , enets , selkups ( speakers of samoyedic languages ) the nenets language is on the samoyedic branch of the uralic language family , with two major dialects , forest nenets and tundra nenets ethnologue says that in siberia , most young people are still fluent in nenets , whereas in european russia , they tend to speak russian there are two distinct groups of nenets sensu stricto , based on their economy : the tundra nenets ( living far to the north ) and the khandeyar or forest nenets a distinct third group of nenets ( yaran people ) has emerged as a result of intermarriages between nenets and izhma komi people they ended up between the kanin and taymyr peninsulas , around the ob and yenisey rivers , with only a few of them settling into small communities like kolva they bred the samoyed dog to help herd their reindeer and pull their sleds , and european explorers later used these dogs for polar expeditions , because they were well adapted to the arctic conditions they were forced to settle in villages and their children were educated in state boarding schools , which resulted in erosion of their cultural identity however , once the nenets had to transition to a life away from the tundra , men found that they had lost their role much of the responsibility that awaited them in the village was considered , from the traditional point of view , to be women 's work in taiga villages occupations such as market gardening , fur farming , cattle breeding , trade , medicine , etc were emphasized and these happened to be the ones that were marketed towards women another method was for young herders to get a job as official workers of the state and pasture their own collective reindeer herd along with the private herd of one of their relatives although the nenets people were able to remain resilient in the face of continuous change and maltreatment , a new challenge now awaits them as oil and gas companies continue to expand , along with it has come an expansion of infrastructure coming in the form of roads , power lines as well as human and vehicle traffic a big milestone was in 2008 , when gazprom , the largest natural gas company in the world , entered the yamal peninsula in their efforts to launch the yamal megaproject however , the companies that enter the yamal peninsula also prefer this rugged terrain to build their infrastructure upon , causing a direct overlap in land of interest thus , as the nenets people rely on reindeer that , in turn , rely on the migratory routes , the expansion of industrial development has had a large impact on the nenets people the nenets people have a tradition of designating a scared spot where they make a request of the spirits for a successful migration as the nenets people depend on the fish as their source of food in the summer , the depletion of fish has directly impacted the nenets people since the arrival of large oil and gas companies in the 1990 's , climate in the region has been impacted as the herders need open water to freeze to make crossings of reindeer and herders possible , there is a specific window in which herders can visit their local health clinics although the industrial companies have paid compensations and made efforts to assist the nenets people , some experts say that the current process does not allow for participation from the nenets people there exists a rural protest community called voice of the tundra that currently speaks on topics such as the rights of the nenets people the voice of the tundra focuses its attention on three main issues : a shortage of land for the reindeer due to oil and gas companies expanding use of the territories , the uncertainty surrounding the future of nomadic reindeer herding , and the lack of indigenous leadership and organization this petition brought attention to the russian officials who were not addressing the '' real life of the tundra and indigenous people '' although there are many nenets people who are against the industrial development going on in the yamal peninsula such as the activists aforementioned , there are also many who are in support of the developments in a research study conducted in the area , one villager reported that they were able to coexist with the industries through social agreements , voluntary giving , and compensation for damages this reasoning can be seen as falling similarly in line with what the voice of the tundra was fighting for , as it can be seen that proper indigenous leadership and involvement can lead to higher satisfaction among the nenets people
