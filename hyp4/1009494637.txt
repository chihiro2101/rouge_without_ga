the modal voice , or modal register , and falsetto register differ primarily in the action of the vocal cords william vennard describes this process as follows : in the modal register , the vocal folds ( when viewed with a stroboscope ) are seen to contact with each other completely during each vibration , closing the gap between them fully , if just for a very short time when the air pressure in the trachea rises as a result of this closure , the folds are blown apart , while the vocal processes of the arytenoid cartilages remain in apposition in falsetto , however , the vocal folds are seen to be blown apart and in untrained falsetto singers a permanent oval orifice is left in the middle between the edges of the two folds through which a certain volume of air escapes continuously as long as the register is engaged ( the singer is singing using the voice ) the length or size of the oval orifice or separation between the folds can vary , but it is known to get bigger as the pressure of air pushed out is increased one possible explanation for this failure to recognize the female falsetto sooner is that when men phonate in the falsetto register there is a much more pronounced change in timbre and dynamic level between the modal and falsetto registers than there is in female voices this is due in part to the difference in the length and mass of the vocal folds and to the difference in frequency ranges celebrated opera singer and voice teacher richard miller pointed out in his 1997 publication national schools of singing : english , french , german , and italian that while the german school of voice teachers had largely embraced the idea of a female falsetto into pedagogical practice , there is division within the french and english schools and a complete rejection of the idea of female falsetto in the italian school of singing in his 2004 book , solutions for singers : tools for performers and teachers , miller said , '' it is illogical to speak of a female falsetto , because the female is incapable of producing a timbre in the upper range that is radically different from its mezza voce or voce piena in testa qualities '' mckinney , who expressed alarm that many books on the art of singing completely ignore or gloss over the issue of female falsetto or insist that women do not have falsetto , argues that many young female singers substitute falsetto for the upper portion of the modal voice he believes that this failure to recognize the female falsetto voice has led to the misidentification of young contraltos and mezzo-sopranos as sopranos , as it is easier for these lower voice types to sing in the soprano tessitura using their falsetto register the physician , giovanni camillo maffei , in his book discorso della voce e del modo d'apparare di cantar di garganta in 1562 , explained that when a bass singer sang in the soprano range , the voice was called '' falsetto '' the falsetto register is used by male countertenors to sing in the alto and occasionally the soprano range and was the standard before women sang in choirs there is a difference between the modern usage of the '' head voice '' term and its previous meaning in the renaissance as a type of falsetto , according to many singing professionals in mexico , one of the famous singers of falsete was miguel aceves mej√≠a , a singer and actor in the golden age of mexican cinema , known as the '' rey de falsete '' , or '' falsetto king '' as with other aspects of hawaiian music , falsetto developed from a combination of sources , including pre-european hawaiian chanting , early christian hymn singing and the songs and yodeling of immigrant cowboys , called '' paniolos '' in the hawaiian language , during the kamehameha reign in the 1800s when cowboys were brought from mexico to teach hawaiians how to care for cattle in the absence of modern vocal training to hold back the volume of modal voice , in this overlapping area a given pitch in modal voice will be louder than the same pitch sung in falsetto the type of vocal cord vibration that produces the falsetto voice precludes loud singing except in the highest tones of that register ; it also limits the available tone colors because of the simplicity of its waveform falsetto , however , does involve less physical effort by the singer than the modal voice and , when properly used , can make possible some desirable tonal effects classical music for comic effect in both operas and musicals by falsettists , sopranists , male altos or countertenors in tessitura for pitches which are above the range of the modal register for pianissimo tones that would be difficult to execute in the modal register
