'' a language such as etruscan , for example , can be said to be both extinct and dead : inscriptions are ill understood even by the most knowledgeable scholars , and the language ceased to be used in any form long ago , so that there have been no speakers , native or non-native , for many centuries in their study of contact-induced language change , american linguists sarah grey thomason and terrence kaufman ( 1991 ) stated that in situations of cultural pressure ( where populations are forced to speak a dominant language ) , three linguistic outcomes may occur : first - and most commonly - a subordinate population may shift abruptly to the dominant language , leaving the native language to a sudden linguistic death in contrast to an extinct language , which no longer has any speakers , or any written use , a historical language may remain in use as a literary or liturgical language long after it ceases to be spoken natively historical languages with living descendants that have undergone significant language change may be considered '' extinct '' , especially in cases where they did not leave a corpus of literature or liturgy that remained in widespread use ( see corpus language ) , as is the case with old english or old high german relative to their contemporary descendants , english and german the revival of hebrew has been largely successful due to extraordinarily favourable conditions , notably the creation of a israel in which it became the official language , as well as eliezer ben-yehuda 's extreme dedication to the revival of the language , by creating new words for the modern terms hebrew lacked the third and most rare outcome is for the pressured group to maintain as much of its native language as possible , while borrowing elements of the dominant language 's grammar ( replacing all , or portions of , the grammar of the original language ) through time latin underwent both common and divergent changes in phonology , morphology , syntax and lexicon and continues today as the native language of hundreds of millions of people , renamed as different romance languages and dialects ( french , italian , spanish , corsican , asturian , ladin , etc the most prominent western example of such a language is latin , but comparable cases are found throughout world history due to the universal tendency to retain a historical stage of a language as liturgical language for example , when people migrate to a new country , their children attend school in the country , and the schools are likely to teach them in the majority language of the country rather than their parents ' native language the cornish language revival is an example of a major successful language revival : after a century of effort there are 3,500 claimed native speakers ; enough for unesco to change its classification from '' extinct '' to '' critically endangered '' institutions such as the education system , as well as ( often global ) forms of media such as the internet , television , and print media play a significant role in the process of language loss 57 & 60 in ghil'ad zuckermann 's a new vision for '' israeli hebrew '' : theoretical and practical implications of analysing israel 's main language as a semi-engineered semito-european hybrid language , journal of modern jewish studies 5 : 57â€“71 ( 2006 ) the dodo 's fate : how languages become extinct the foundation of endangered languages endangered languages photos of letters/characters from ancient and living languages featured on exterior walls of library of alexandria this last observation illustrates that for latin , old english , or old high german to be described accurately as dead or extinct , the language in question must be conceptualized as frozen in time at a particular state of its history such languages are sometimes also referred to as '' dead languages '' , but more typically as classical languages language revival is the attempt to re-introduce a recently extinct language in everyday use by a new generation of native speakers dr anna goldsworthy on the barngarla language reclamation , the monthly , september 2014 hebrew is an example of a liturgical language that has successfully been revived for everyday use
