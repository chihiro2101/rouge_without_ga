when eric was 9 , he and his brother ludwig , 14 , boarded the gerolstein at antwerp , belgium , and joined their uncle in brooklyn on may 11 , 1939 , to be followed later by his parents after arriving in the united states and settling in brooklyn , kandel was tutored by his grandfather in judaic studies and was accepted at the yeshiva of flatbush , from which he graduated in 1944 '' my grandfather and i liked each other a great deal , and he readily convinced me that he should tutor me in hebrew during the summer of 1939 so that i might be eligible for a scholarship at the yeshiva of flatbush , an excellent hebrew parochial school that offered both secular and religious studies at a very high level by the time i graduated in 1944 i spoke hebrew almost as well as english , had read through the five books of moses ; the books of kings , the prophets and the judges in hebrew ; and also learned a smattering of the talmud & nbsp ; however , while skinner championed a strict separation of psychology , as its own level of discourse , from biological considerations such as neurology , kandel 's work is essentially centered on an explanation of the relationships between psychology and neurology sigmund freud , a pioneer in revealing the importance of unconscious neural processes , was at the root of kandel 's interest in the biology of motivation and unconscious and conscious memory when kandel joined the laboratory of neurophysiology at the us national institutes of health in 1957 , william beecher scoville and brenda milner had recently described the patient hm , who had lost the ability to form new memories after removal of his hippocampus but , with respect to memory , there was nothing in the general electrophysiological properties of hippocampal neurons that suggested why the hippocampus was special for explicit memory storage kandel began to realize that memory storage must rely on modifications in the synapse connections between neurons and that the complex connectivity of the hippocampus did not provide the best system for study of the detailed function of synapses '' while recording the behavior of a single cell in a ganglion , one nerve axon pathway to the ganglion could be stimulated weakly electrically as a conditioned tactile stimulus , while another pathway was stimulated as an unconditioned pain stimulus , following the exact protocol used for classical conditioning with natural stimuli in intact animals kandel took a position in the departments of physiology and psychiatry at the new york university medical school , eventually forming the division of neurobiology and behavior by 1981 , laboratory members including terry walters , tom abrams , and robert hawkins had been able to extend the aplysia system into the study of classical conditioning , a finding that helped close the apparent gap between the simple forms of learning often associated with invertebrates and more complex types of learning more often recognized in vertebrates '' kandel 's winning of the 2000 nobel prize in physiology or medicine was a result of his work with aplysia on the biological mechanisms of memory storage in 1974 kandel moved his lab to columbia university and became founding director of the center for neurobiology and behavior since 1974 , kandel actively contributes to science as a member of the division of neurobiology and behavior at the department of psychiatry at columbia university ( jack ) byrne 1970–1975 : professor and director of the neuroscience research center at ut health science center ( mcgovern medical school ) ;
