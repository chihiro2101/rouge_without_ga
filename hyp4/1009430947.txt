martin bateson ( 1900–1922 ) , the second brother , was then expected to follow in his father 's footsteps as a scientist , but came into conflict with his father over his ambition to become a poet and playwright the resulting stress , combined with a disappointment in love , resulted in martin 's public suicide by gunshot under the statue of anteros in piccadilly circus on 22 april 1922 , which was john 's birthday in the 1940s , he helped extend systems theory and cybernetics to the social and behavioral sciences in palo alto , california , bateson developed the double bind theory , together with his colleagues donald jackson , jay haley and john weakland , also known as the bateson project ( 1953–1963 ) bateson was one of the original members of the core group of the macy conferences in cybernetics ( 1941–1960 ) , and the later set on group processes ( 1954–1960 ) , where he represented the social and behavioral sciences in the 1970s , he taught at the humanistic psychology institute in san francisco , renamed the saybrook university , and in 1972 joined the faculty of kresge college at the university of california , santa cruz per the jacket copy of the first edition of mind and nature ( 1979 ) in 1976 , he was elected a fellow of the american academy of arts and sciences california governor jerry brown appointed him to the regents of the university of california , a position he held until his death , although he resigned from the special research projects committee in 1979 in opposition to the university 's work on nuclear weapons bateson spent the last decade of his life developing a '' meta-science '' of epistemology to bring together the various early forms of systems theory developing in different fields of science bateson and sumner were divorced in 1957 , after which bateson was married a third time , to therapist and social worker lois cammack ( born 1928 ) , in 1961 bateson died on july 4 , 1980 , at age 76 , in the guest house of the san francisco zen center 'gregory bateson : old men ought to be explorers ' , stephen nachmanovitch , coevolution quarterly , fall 1982 the 2014 novel euphoria by lily king is a fictionalized account of bateson 's relationships with mead and reo fortune in pre-wwii new guinea in '' from versailles to cybernetics , '' bateson argues that the history of the twentieth century can be perceived as the history of a malfunctioning relationship he therefore claims that the treaty of versailles and the development of cybernetics—which for him represented the possibility of improved relationships—are the only two anthropologically important events of the twentieth century in his 1936 book naven he defined the term , based on his iatmul fieldwork , as '' a process of differentiation in the norms of individual behaviour resulting from cumulative interaction between individuals '' ( p and during a male rite , a mother 's brother may slide his buttocks down the leg of his honoured sister 's son , a complex gesture of masculine birthing , pride , and insult , rarely performed before women , that brings the honoured sister 's son to tears university of michigan press bateson suggested the influence of a circular system of causation , and proposed that : women watched for the spectacular performances of the men , and there can be no reasonable doubt that the presence of an audience is a very important factor in shaping the men 's behavior in short , the behaviour of person x affects person y , and the reaction of person y to person x 's behaviour will then affect person x 's behaviour , which in turn will affect person y , and so on bateson 's experiences with the iatmul led him to publish a book in 1936 titled naven : a survey of the problems suggested by a composite picture of the culture of a new guinea tribe drawn from three points of view ( cambridge university press ) bateson 's book argued that this approach was naive , since an anthropologist 's account of a culture was always and fundamentally shaped by whatever theory the anthropologist employed to define and analyse the data in effect , naven allowed men and women to experience momentarily the emotional lives of each other , and thereby to achieve a level of psychological integration much later , bateson would harness the very same idea to the development of the double-bind theory of schizophrenia in the epilogue to the book , bateson was clear : '' the writing of this book has been an experiment , or rather a series of experiments , in methods of thinking about anthropological material '' that is to say , his overall point was not to describe iatmul culture of the naven ceremony but to explore how different modes of analysis , using different premises and analytic frameworks , could lead to different explanations of the same sociocultural phenomenon see , most recently , michael houseman and carlo seviri , 1998 , naven or the other self : a relational approach to ritual action ( leiden : brill ) ;

or a child is encouraged to speak freely , but criticised or silenced whenever he or she actually does so ) the double bind was originally presented ( probably mainly under the influence of bateson 's psychiatric co-workers ) as an explanation of part of the etiology of schizophrenia the first is the idea that although environmental stresses have theoretically been believed to guide or dictate the changes in the soma ( physical body ) , the introduction of new stresses do not automatically result in the physical changes necessary for survival as suggested by original evolutionary theory according to bateson , none of these positions ( at the time ) could be tested but he called for the creation of a test which could possibly prove or disprove the theoretical positions suggested within in his book steps to an ecology of mind , bateson applied cybernetics to the field of ecological anthropology and the concept of homeostasis he saw the natural ecological system as innately good as long as it was allowed to maintain homeostasis and that the key unit of survival in evolution was an organism and its environment according to bateson , consciousness is the bridge between the cybernetic networks of individual , society and ecology and the mismatch between the systems due to improper understanding will result in the degradation of the entire supreme cybernetic system or mind bateson claims that man will never be able to control the whole system because it does not operate in a linear fashion and if man creates his own rules for the system , he opens himself up to becoming a slave to the self-made system due to the non-linear nature of cybernetics by acting with this greater wisdom of the supreme cybernetic system as a whole man can change his relationship to mind from one of schism , in which he is endlessly tied up in constant competition , to one of complementarity refers to a method of comparing patterns of relationship , and their symmetry or asymmetry ( as in , for example , comparative anatomy ) , especially in complex organic ( or mental ) systems a term he coined in the 1940s referring to the organisation of learning , or learning to learn : schismogenesis – the emergence of divisions within social groups form , substance , and difference , in steps to an ecology of mind , p his other daughter the filmmaker nora bateson released an ecology of mind , a documentary that premiered at the vancouver international film festival this film was selected as the audience favourite with the morton marcus documentary feature award at the 2011 santa cruz film festival , and honoured with the 2011 john culkin award for outstanding praxis in the field of media ecology by the media ecology association
