although tocqueville had favoured retention of distinct traditional law , administrators , schools and so on for arabs who had come under french control , he judged the berber tribes of kabylie ( in his second of two letters on algeria , 1837 ) as '' savages '' not suited for this arrangement because he argued they would best be managed not by force of arms , but by the pacifying influences of commerce and cultural interaction such laws are not discussed in detail , but given that the goal of the french mission in algeria was to obtain commercial and military interest as opposed to self-defense , it can be deduced that tocqueville would not concur with just war theory 's jus ad bellum criteria of just cause in the case of algeria , the port of algiers and the control over the strait of gibraltar were considered by tocqueville to be particularly valuable whereas direct control of the political operations of the entirety of algeria was not although in his 1841 report on algeria he applauded bugeaud for making war in a way that defeated abd-el-kader 's resistance , he had advocated in the two letters that the french military advance leave kabylie undisturbed and in subsequent speeches and writings he continued to oppose intrusion into kabylie tocqueville includes in his report on algeria that the fate of their soldiers and finances depended on how the french government treats the various native populations of algeria , including the various arab tribes , independent kabyles living in the atlas mountains and the powerful political leader abd-el-kader in opposition to olivier le cour grandmaison , jean-louis beno√Æt said that given the extent of racial prejudices during the colonization of algeria , tocqueville was one of its '' most moderate supporters '' in his 1847 '' report on algeria '' , tocqueville declared that europe should avoid making the same mistake they made with the european colonization of the americas in order to avoid the bloody consequences it seems that tocqueville modified his views after his second visit to algeria in 1846 as he criticized bugeaud 's desire to invade kabylie in an 1847 speech to the assembly alexis de tocqueville and gustave de beaumont in america : their friendship and their travels , edited by olivier zunz , translated by arthur goldhammer ( university of virginia press , 2011 , , 698 pages further , given that tocqueville approved of the use of force to eliminate civilian housing in enemy territory , his approach does not accord with just war theory 's jus in bello criteria of proportionality and discrimination tocqueville considered bugeaud 's plan to invade kabylie despite the opposition of the assembly as a seditious act in the face of which the government was opting for cowardice
