following the intervention of the ita , a temporary service was set up — independent television service for wales and the west , broadcasting from the old tww pontcanna studios in cardiff , and staffed by former tww workers , until harlech ( soon renamed '' htv '' ) was ready to take over its franchise early , on 20 may 1968 having felt desperately hard-done-by the ita , and in the fits of a corporate tantrum , the company showed their final display of anger by closing down with come to an end , a reflective epilogue with john betjeman , who had made several films for the station , paying tribute to the personnel , programmes and achievements of tww ( which betjeman affectionately referred to as tellywelly ) in january 1964 , tww was required to take over the franchise of its neighbour , teledu cymru ( the on-screen name of wales west and north television , wwn ) when that company became the only itv company to fail financially until 1965 , viewers in both south east wales and the english west parts of the franchise received itv on vhf channel 10 from the ita transmitter at st hilary located on stalling down , near cowbridge in south wales whilst the original service provided by tww from st hilary had to carry a mix of content for viewers on each side of the bristol channel , the west and north of wales were served by other vhf transmitters which carried a more specific welsh programme service branded teledu cymru tww had acquired the licence to broadcast to the west and north of wales following the commercial failure of wales west and north television ( wwn ) which originally held a separate franchise licence for a much larger but , critically , less densely populated part of wales list of counties of wales by population in 1971 following the acquisition of wwn , a second vhf transmitter ( using vhf channel 7 ) was added at st hilary in 1965 st hilary transmitting station to effectively extend the ex-wwn transmitter network into se wales thus permitting programmes of specific interest in wales to be broadcast exclusively to wales whilst running a separate schedule for english viewers on channel 10 this was the first significant step in providing two distinct and separate programme services for wales and for west and effectively established tww 's area as a 'dual region ' during the last few years of their tenure the introduction of the uhf transmitter network for itv , including particularly the mendip transmitter and the start of htv 's uhf transmissions from there and wenvoe in 1970 , replicated the separation of itv programme services to wales and the west tww did not produce many programmes for the itv network , although the monthly sunday evening welsh musical entertainment show , land of song , proved very popular during it six-year run 1958-64 ; but tww 's news and local programming were well regarded ( it won many plaudits for its sensitive coverage of the aberfan disaster ) bruce lewis was one of tww 's main news presenters ; he went on to write various books about his experience during the second world war , '' aircrew , a few of the first '' , plus other titles such as how to be a tv presenter – his son , peter lewis , hosted movie magazine and went on to announce for tww , htv west , and most famously , lwt
