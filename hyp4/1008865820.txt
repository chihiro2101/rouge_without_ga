derwent is derived from brittonic river name , latinised as , meaning '' ( belonging/pertaining to the ) forest of oak trees '' ; the old river name survived in medieval welsh poetry , such as ( '' dinogad 's smock '' ) attached to the larger poem , as it flows through the upper derwent valley , and for most of its first forms the county boundary between derbyshire , on its west bank , and south yorkshire , on the east bank below ambergate , the river flows through the town of belper and the villages of milford and duffield , where it is joined by the river ecclesbourne initially , the need for water power was quite modest , for example lombe 's mill in derby , which is considered to be the forerunner of the later cotton mills , only needed to use the power provided by a small mill stream , and richard arkwright 's cromford mill , the world 's first water-powered cotton spinning mill , only used a small tributary of the derwent in conjunction with a lead mine sough these sites were all important in the development of the industrial revolution , and arkwright 's innovation , along with several local competitors , is recognised today by the designation of the area as the derwent valley mills the power of the derwent is still harnessed at a number of these historic mill sites , producing hydro-electricity from turbines instead of driving mill wheels , with a recent development being the construction of a hydro-electric station at longbridge weir , adjacent to the riverside gardens in derby between derby and rowsley the valley is followed by the a6 road , which was the main road from london to manchester until the creation of the motorway network , and is still a busy single-carriageway road the sheffield line still operates as part of the midland main line , but the manchester line was severed north of matlock in 1968 , and the section from ambergate to matlock now forms the derwent valley line , a single-track branch line alphabetical listing of tributaries , extracted from the water framework directive list of water bodies for the derbyshire derwent : river amber river ashop bar brook , which joins the derwent near baslow black brook , near belper bottle brook , at little eaton bentley brook chaddesden brook , in derby river ecclesbourne highlow brook , near hathersage hood brook , also near hathersage lea brook , near high peak junction ladybower brook ( highshore clough catchment ) , flows into ladybower reservoir markeaton brook , joins the derwent in derby river noe river westend river wye file : boggy ground in swains greave - geograph.org.uk - 1495447.jpg boggy ground in swains greave , on bleaklow image : upper derwent from oaken bank.jpg the river in its highest stretch , on howden moor close to the source image : island in derwent reservoir , with howden dam behind.jpg derwent reservoir , with river water cascading over howden dam , and howden moor in the background image : river derwent at calver.jpg the river at calver image : chatsworthweir.jpg weir in the river at chatsworth house image : river derwent at matlock bath.jpg the river at matlock bath , as seen from the heights of abraham cable car image : derwent valley upstream of whatstandwell.jpg the valley of the derwent upstream of whatstandwell image : riverderwent.jpg the river just south of duffield image : derby council house and river derwent.jpg the river outside the council house , derby
