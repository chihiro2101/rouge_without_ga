all commands of the canadian forces ( cf ) ( that is , royal canadian navy , canadian army , royal canadian air force , canadian joint operations command , and canadian special operations forces command ) are primarily governed by the national defence act ( nda ) these instruments can be found in the canadian forces administrative orders and defence administrative orders and directives ; they are used as direction for authorities within the cf to administer the day-to-day considerations of the forces for example , officer cadets attending military college are organized and subject to regulations more appropriate for their academic success than the enforcement of discipline , as might be expected of fully trained members the branch interprets the canadian forces ' own internal rules and code of discipline , and also international and humanitarian laws and codes of war , such as the geneva conventions the military law centre on the grounds of royal military college of canada , staffed with military lawyers , oversees the education of officers and troops in legal matters , trains military lawyers and advises ottawa on matters of policy and doctrine the military jurisdiction starts from the moment when a person reports to duty or was liable to report to duty and lasts to the moment when the person has been discharged from service and , in case of conscripts and involuntarily activated reservists , has also left the military area the most important of these are various types of '' service crime '' which encompasses all voluntary and negligent disobedience of orders and regulations , '' guard crime '' , encompassing any misdeed during guarding duty , absence without leave , desertion , diverse forms of disobedience against superiors , misuses of a position as superior and behaviour unsuitable for military person the military has a jurisdiction to investigate all military crimes proper , and also a number of other crimes that have been specifically listed as belonging to the military jurisdiction when the military has jurisdiction over an ordinary crime , and the crime carries fine as a punishment , a disciplinary punishment may be given instead of fine both in summary proceedings and in the courts of law wiretaps , use of deep cover agents or computer intrusion ) they may either request the police to conduct the measure or hand over the case to the police , as agreed between the investigator and the competent policeman in the border guard , the border guard headquarters has the same internal law enforcement authority as the defence command in the defence forces , in addition to the regular law enforcement powers of the border guard the range is company sergeant major : a private warning , up to three shifts of extra duty ( only to conscripts and involuntarily activated reservists ) company commander : a private warning , up to five shifts of extra duty , up to 10 days of confinement to the garrison , a public letter of reprimand battalion commander , all of above , and up to fifteen days of confinement to garrison brigade commander and his superiors : all of above and up to 30 disciplinary fines , one disciplinary fine being one fifth of the individual 's daily gross income , or for conscripts , at least conscript 's daily allowance the court of appeals , that acts as the first instance for the prosecution of officers with at least major 's rank , will have a military member who has at least a major 's rank the military members of the courts of appeals are selected by the ministry of justice on motion of the ministry of defence an exception is formed by the disciplinary arrest , which may be sentenced for up to 30 days and is served in the detention facilities of the convict 's garrison when the military person holds a permanent or temporary paid position as a state military servant , as all officers and ncos in regular active service do , they will be sentenced to dismissal in addition to other punishments , if they are convicted of a military or a civilian crime for more than two years in prison and there are no special grounds for leniency typically , this is the case when a reservist is absent from an obligatory refresher exercise or a conscript is , after the commission of crime , declared unfit for duty for medical or security reasons in addition to judicial dismissal , the defence forces and the border guard have the option of administratively ending the military person 's service if the person is in a paid position any person who is sentenced to prison for at least two years or to prison for any length of time for a crime of treasonous nature ( specifically , crimes in chapters 11 and 12 of the penal code , e.g the crime of absence without leave is committed by a soldier who is even a minute late , and a slightest wilful or negligent disregard for a standing order or a regulation fulfils the indicia of the '' service crime '' this translates as the extent of punishable disregard for duty is both in the proposed and existing legislation wider than that of punishable disregard for civil servant 's duty as defined in the section 10 , chapter 40 of the penal code , as there is no minimum threshold below which the disregard would not be criminal this is , nonetheless , well founded , for practical experience has demonstrated that especially in a military community , measures taken as early as possible to curtail phenomena endangering discipline and order , however slight they may seem , are an efficient way to minimize the number of more serious crimes members of any branch of the bundeswehr , the german armed forces , are subject to the ordinary civil jurisdiction and unless otherwise stated all civil laws apply to soldiers as well 96 ii to create military courts under special circumstances : in times of war , outside germany or on a german vessel , acting under a legal judge and only for members of the armed forces the military penal code ( wehrstrafgesetz ) applies to soldiers by extending the civil penal code ( strafgesetzbuch ) to crimes that can be only committed on military duty : general offenses ( such as desertion , illegal use of weapons and more ) and offenses that interfere with the military hierarchy ( such as mutiny or abuse ) the head of the unit as immediate superior who acts as primary disciplinary master has the exclusive right to choose : non-judicial punishment ( such as fines , curfews , arrests up to 7 days ) , forwarding the decision to the next superior officer of the unit ( arrest then can be extended up to 21 days ) or calling the military service court ( truppendienstgericht ) which has the power for further punishment ( like degradation and shortening the salary up to five years ) in the case of a soldier being sentenced to jail for one year or more ( 6 months or more in case of bribery ) he will be discharged from the armed forces there is increasing voice in the country for the reform on the lines other liberal democracies are seeing in their military justice system the armed forces act 2006 replaces the three separate service discipline acts and earlier armed forces acts as the system of law under which the armed forces operate in the previous decade the european convention on human rights ( echr ) had considerable impact on the administration of military justice , particularly the need for the independence of the courts martial system it deals with military offences , civil offences committed in some circumstances , offences by civilian subject to service discipline ( including family members ) , authority of commanding officer to deal with offences summarily , the court martial , the service civilian court , custody and appeals the military judicial system is headed by the judge advocate general who is a civilian and part of the ministry of justice the ucmj is federal law , found in title 10 united states code chapter 47 , and implemented by the manual for courts-martial , an executive order issued by the president of the united states in his capacity as commander-in-chief of the united states armed forces court-martial convictions in the united states may be appealed through military courts of appeal to the united states court of appeals for the armed forces ( caaf ) , a federal appellate court consisting of five civilian judges appointed by the president of the united states the offenses covered by the ucmj include those encompassed by '' high crimes and misdemeanors '' which covers officials generally , and includes perjury of oath , abuse of authority , bribery , intimidation , misuse of assets , failure to supervise , dereliction of duty , conduct unbecoming , and refusal to obey a lawful order it also includes ordinary crimes , but perhaps with different standards of proof and punishment than for civilians , on the grounds that more is expected of military personnel by their oaths of office
