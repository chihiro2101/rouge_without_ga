sometimes , as in the case of pearl buck 's the good earth ( 1931 ) , the accounts are relatively neutral or empirical , implying a respect for chinese culture ( note however that buck 's previous novel , '' east wind : west wind '' , extensively explores the unbinding of a woman 's feet , experienced as frightening and painful yet finally empowering , as part of her transition into a new , more modern and more individualistic persona under her doctor husband 's tender tutelage ) the desirability varies with the size of the feet & ndash ; the perfect bound feet and the most desirable ( called '' golden lotuses '' ) would be around 3 chinese inches ( around 4 inches ( 10 & nbsp ; cm ) in western measurement ) or smaller , while those larger may be called '' silver lotuses '' ( 4 chinese inches ) or '' iron lotuses '' ( 5 chinese inches or larger and the least desirable for marriage ) the tightness of the binding meant that the circulation in the feet was faulty , and the circulation to the toes was almost cut off , so any injuries to the toes were unlikely to heal and were likely to gradually worsen and lead to infected toes and rotting flesh if the infection in the feet and toes entered the bones , it could cause them to soften , which could result in toes dropping off ; however , this was seen as a benefit because the feet could then be bound even more tightly in the song dynasty , the status of women declined , and a common argument is that the decline was the result of the revival of confucianism as neo-confucianism during the song dynasty , and that in addition to promoting the seclusion of women and the cult of widow chastity , it also contributed to the development of footbinding some scholars such as laurel bossen and hill gates reject the notion that bound feet in china were considered more beautiful , or that it was a means of male control over women , a sign of class status , or a chance for women to marry well ( in general , bound women did not improve their class position by marriage ) emily prager 's short story '' a visit from the footbinder '' , from her collection of short stories of the same name ( 1982 ) , describes the last few hours of a young chinese girl 's childhood before the professional footbinder arrives to initiate her into the adult woman 's life of beauty and pain it has been argued that while the practice started out as a fashion , it persisted because it became an expression of han identity after the mongols invaded china in 1279 , and later the manchus ' conquest in 1644 , as it was then practiced only by han women for many , the bound feet were an enhancement to a woman 's beauty and made her movement more dainty , and a woman with perfect lotus feet was likely to make a more prestigious marriage this tale of a girl who lost her shoe and then married a king who sought the owner of the shoe as only her foot was small enough to fit the shoe contains elements of the european story of cinderella , and is thought to be one of its antecedents anthropologist fred blake argued that the practice of footbinding was a form of discipline undertaken by women themselves , and perpetuated by women on their daughters , so as to inform their daughters of their role and position in society , and to support and participate in the neo-confucian way of being civilized in the film the inn of the sixth happiness ( 1958 ) , ingrid bergman portrays british missionary to china gladys aylward , who is assigned as a foreigner the task by a local mandarin to unbind the feet of young women , an unpopular order that the civil government had failed to fulfill the interpretive models used include fashion ( the chinese customs may be compared to examples of western women 's fashion such as corsetry ) ; seclusion ( sometimes evaluated as morally superior to the gender mingling in the west ) ; perversion ( the practice imposed by men with sexual perversions ) , inexplicable deformation , child abuse , and extreme cultural traditionalism some men found the smell of the bound feet attractive , and some also apparently believed that bound feet would cause layers of folds to develop in the vagina , and that the thighs would become sensuously heavier and the vagina tighter according to robert van gulik , the bound feet were also considered the most intimate part of a woman 's body ; in erotic art of the qing period where the genitalia may be shown , the bound feet were never depicted uncovered these scholars argued that the coming of the mechanized industry at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century , such as the introduction of industrial textile processes , resulted in a loss of light handwork for women , removing a reason to maintain the practice older women were more likely to break hips and other bones in falls , since they could not balance securely on their feet , and were less able to rise to their feet from a sitting position they argued that foot binding was an instrumental means to reserve women to handwork , and can be seen as a way by mothers to tie their daughters down , train them in handwork and keep them close at hand during the qing dynasty , attempts were made by the manchus to ban the practice but failed , and it has been argued the attempts at banning may have in fact led to a spread of the practice among han chinese in the 17th and 18th centuries even after the foot bones had healed , they were prone to re-breaking repeatedly , especially when the girl was in her teenage years and her feet were still soft
