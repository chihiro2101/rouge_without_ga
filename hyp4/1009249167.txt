it has three main segments : the 66-story tower rising from the eastern part of the base with the famous rainbow room restaurant on the 65th floor , and , formerly , the rockefeller family office ; a windowless segment in the middle of the base that houses nbc studios ; and a shorter 16-story tower on the western part of the base at 1250 avenue of the americas '' the new york state office of parks , recreation and historic preservation commissioned a report in 1974 entitled '' grand central terminal and rockefeller center : a historic-critical estimate of their significance '' , in which they concluded that rockefeller center , along with central park and grand central terminal , were the only three developments that could slow down manhattan 's '' remorseless process of expansion and decay '' the current complex is a combination of two building complexes and a standalone building : the original 14 art deco office buildings from the 1930s , one building across 51st street built in 1947 , and a set of four international-style towers built along the west side of avenue of the americas during the 1960s and 1970s opened in 1933 as the rca building , the building has been renamed multiple times , first to the ge building in 1988 , after general electric bought rca , and then to the comcast building in 2014 after comcast 's purchase of nbcuniversal even mumford praised the complex , lamenting in 1947 that the new headquarters of the united nations on first avenue had no '' human scale '' or '' transition from the intimate to the monumental '' , whereas rockefeller center 's buildings '' produce an aesthetic effect out of all proportion to their size '' . for a reference to the roller skating rink 's opening , see : its popularity inspired the construction of a skating rink in the former center theatre , and for a short time , there were also proposals to convert the lower plaza 's ice rink to a roller skating rink during the springtime the largest and most grand of the gardens was the '' garden of the nations '' ( alternatively '' gardens of the nations '' ) , which was installed on the eleventh-floor roof of 30 rockefeller plaza and opened in april 1935 the current international theme was decided on due to a lack of american tenants willing to rent there ; eventually , the buildings were occupied by british , french , and italian interests , although the italian interests ultimately were the only foreign tenants who rented for the long term the rko building served as headquarters for its namesake company 's movie production in the 1930s , and was renamed for the american metal climax company ( amax ) , its new owners , in the early 1960s even though allen thought that the art was mediocre and the opportunities for a less lively complex were wasted , he stated that rockefeller center had an aura of '' festivity '' around it , unlike most other office buildings in america mumford 's view of the complex was only marginally less negative when he revisited the issue in december 1933 : he said that it could be '' large , exciting , and romantic '' at night , but that '' a mountain or ash heap of the same size would do the trick almost as well , if the lights were cleverly arranged '' the original intention of the street 's construction was to enhance the shopping district of fifth avenue , to its east , but this never happened , and rockefeller plaza now primarily serves as a pedestrian passage that connects all of rockefeller center 's separate components the building 's entrance design , blending in with that of the other buildings in the radio city section , is marked by three sculptural bas-reliefs created by robert garrison for each of the building 's three bays , signifying muses of contemporary thought , morning , and evening rockefeller 's beliefs include '' the supreme worth of the individual and in his right to life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness '' ( the first principle ) and '' truth and justice are fundamental to an enduring social order '' ( the sixth principle ) the model for prometheus was leonardo ( leon ) nole , and the inscription , a paraphrase from aeschylus , on the granite wall behind , reads : '' prometheus , teacher in every art , brought the fire that hath proved to mortals a means to mighty ends until the 1980s , the plaza contained plaques that affirmed columbia university 's ownership of rockefeller center , but these were removed with the 1985 sale of the complex to the rockefeller group the only building in the center built to the outer limits of its lot line , the 15-story building took its shape from associated press 's need for a single , undivided , loft-like newsroom as large as the lot could accommodate—namely , a blocky structure with no setbacks the road was given the name '' rockefeller plaza '' in 1933 , despite the potential confusion with the lower plaza , because it was believed that the '' plaza '' in the road 's name would emphasize its '' spatial unity '' with the lower plaza and channel gardens he called the plan for rockefeller center '' an apotheosis of megalomania , a defiant egotism '' arising from an ostentatious display of wealth , and said that '' the sooner we accomplish the destiny it so perfectly foreshadows , the sooner we shall be able to clear the ground and begin again '' in 1969 , the art historian vincent scully wrote , '' rockefeller center is one of the few surviving public spaces that look as if they were designed and used by people who knew what stable wealth was and were not ashamed to enjoy it pei praised rockefeller center 's lower plaza as being '' perhaps the most successful open space in the united states , perhaps in the world '' , due to its success in drawing visitors 30 rockefeller plaza was built as a single structure occupying the entire block between sixth avenue and rockefeller plaza , and its design was influenced by john todd 's desire for the building to use its air rights to their maximum potential he wrote that although rockefeller center would inevitably be disorganized in its earliest years , it would eventually adhere to a certain '' order '' , and he also praised the complex for being a paragon of '' noble '' and '' efficient '' construction see : one of the center 's more controversial works was man at the crossroads , created by diego rivera , which was originally commissioned for 30 rockefeller plaza 's lobby but was demolished before it could be completed however , that theme was not particularly well received by the architects , so alexander proposed another theme , the '' new frontiers '' ; this theme dealt with social and scientific innovations and represented the challenges that humanity faced '' after the conquest of the physical world '' as an icon of the complex , 30 rockefeller plaza 's architecture influenced the design of the rest of the complex , with its limestone facade and gothic-inspired four-leafed spandrels the roof gardens of the international building 's wings were restored in 1986 for 48,000 each , followed by the gardens on the british and french buildings , which were restored the next year exxon 's corporate headquarters moved into the structure in 1972 , with co-ownership with rockefeller center 's managers , and held an ownership stake there until 1986 , when mitsui & company purchased the building three of the buildings—the tall tower and the two southern retail buildings—were planned after the cancellation of the incongruously designed oval retail building in 1931 , while the two retail buildings to the north were added later the building , located in the middle of the block between rockefeller plaza and fifth avenue , contains a central plaza on its east , facing the fifth avenue entrance , which contains the famous statue of atlas the building contains a low base that is level with the rooftops of the low-rise buildings on 51st and 52nd street , as well as a tall slab rising from the base , aligned in a north-south direction isamu noguchi 's gleaming stainless steel bas-relief , news , over the main entrance to 50 rockefeller plaza ( the associated press building ) was , at the time of commissioning , the largest metal bas-relief in the world sigfried giedion wrote in his book space , time and architecture that rockefeller center 's design was akin to a '' civic center '' whose design represented the 1930s version of the future the 36-story tower at 1 rockefeller plaza , on the east side of the plaza between 48th and 49th streets , is the original time & life building that was opened in april 1937 in 1976 , new york times architectural critic paul goldberger wrote , '' what makes rockefeller center work is that it is at once a formal beaux‐arts‐influenced complex of dignified towers and a lively , utterly contemporary amalgam of shops , plazas and street life the building was completed in 1958 construction on the time-life 's building 's steelwork started in april 1958 , and is owned by the rockefeller group in addition , rockefeller plaza is supported by a multi-level steel skeleton underneath , which houses the underground mall , storage rooms , and the complex 's shipping and loading center the urban planner le corbusier had a more optimistic view of the complex , expressing that rockefeller center was '' rational , logically conceived , biologically normal , and harmonious '' the most cynical opinion came from architectural scholar lewis mumford , who so hated the '' weakly conceived , reckless , romantic chaos '' of the march 1931 plans for rockefeller center that he reportedly went into exile in upstate new york in theory , this was considered a fitting theme , but alexander had been so specific about the details of the necessary artworks that it limited the creative license for any artists who would be commissioned for such works , so he was fired the complex 's owner tishman speyer renovated the concourse in 1999 in an effort to make the underground retail space more noticeable and attract more upscale tenants upon opening , the garden of the nations attracted many visitors because of its collection of exotic flora , and it became the most popular garden in rockefeller center maxwell 's demand paled to that of daniel hurley and patrick daly , owners of a speakeasy who , since 1892 , had leased a property at 49th street the theater 's stage was enlarged for musicals in 1936 , and four years later , 380 seats were removed in order to make way for an ice rink for skating spectaculars the original bronze ornaments and lighting were replaced , air-conditioning was installed , two passageways were demolished , and both ground-level and underground retail spaces were refurbished as part of the renovation in an expansion of hood 's setback-garden plan , alexander 's proposal also included rooftop gardens atop all the buildings , which would create a '' babylonian garden '' when viewed from above one of two skyscrapers that opened in manhattan in 1935 , it was noted for its short 136-day duration of construction , as well as the construction quality , overall design , and materials used previously rivera had painted a controversial fresco in detroit titled detroit industry , commissioned by abby and john 's friend , edsel ford , who later became a trustee of the museum of modern art unlike other buildings in the complex , 600 fifth avenue 's ground level only contained one public entrance to maximize the ground-floor retail space , which was originally leased by swiss interests and pan am airlines the 19-story annex , designed by wallace harrison and max abramovitz , had a glass facade on the lowest two stories—reflecting the design of the former american airlines building across sixth avenue—and a limestone facade above the second story originally , there were 26 flags for each of the members of the united nations , but as more countries became un members , additional rows of poles were added on the north and south sides of the plaza the rockefeller center christmas tree is placed above the statue from november to january every year ; it is usually put in place and lit the week after thanksgiving , and taken down the week after new year 's day it is a six-story standalone building with a limestone facade with a sixth-story setback , as well as a partial -story penthouse on the west half of the seventh story and a garden on the east side of the seventh-story roof the writer frederick lewis allen took a more moderate viewpoint , saying that negative critics had '' hoped for too much '' precisely because rockefeller center had been planned during an economically prosperous time , but was constructed during the depression
