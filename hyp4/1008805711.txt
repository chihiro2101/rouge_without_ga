the botanist carl von linné in his 1737 work flora lapponica identifies the shamrock as trifolium pratense , mentioning it by name as chambroch , with the following curious remark : '' hiberni suo chambroch , quod est trifolium pratense purpureum , aluntur , celeres & promtissimi roburis '' ( the irish call it shamrock , which is purple field clover , and which they eat to make them speedy and of nimble strength ) the shamrock is featured in the '' compartment '' of the royal arms of canada , as part of a wreath of shamrocks , roses , thistles , and lilies ( representing the irish , english , scottish , and french settlers of canada ) it was immensely popular and contributed to raising the profile of the shamrock as an image of ireland : oh the shamrock - through erin 's isle , to sport awhile , as love and valor wander'd with wit , the sprite , whose quiver bright a thousand arrows squander 'd kelly , fergus , early irish farming , ( 2000 ) , dublin , p 311 the situation regarding the identity of the shamrock was further confused by a london botanist james ebenezer bicheno , who proclaimed in a dissertation in 1830 that the real shamrock was oxalis acetosella , a species of wood sorrel it can still be seen on the regimental coat of arms of '' the fighting sixty-ninth '' the erin go bragh flag , used originally by the saint patrick 's battalion of the mexican army , uses an angelic clàrsach , a medieval irish harp , cradled in a wreath of clover the shamrock also appears in the emblems of a wide range of voluntary and non-state organisations in ireland , such as the irish farmers association , the boy scouts of ireland association , scouting ireland irish girl guides , and the irish kidney donors association it has become a tradition for the irish taoiseach to present a bowl of shamrocks in a special waterford crystal bowl featuring a shamrock design to the president of the united states in the white house every st oh the shamrock , the green immortal shamrock ! chosen leaf of bard and chief , old erin 's native shamrock ! throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries , the shamrock continued to appear in a variety of settings the shamrock represents the irish population , one of the four major ethnic groups that made up the population of the city in the 19th century when the arms were designed , the other three being the french ( represented by a fleur-de-lis in the upper-left ) , the english ( represented by a rose in the upper-right ) , and the scots ( represented by a thistle in the lower-left ) throughout the nineteenth century the popularity of the shamrock as a symbol of ireland grew , and it was depicted in many illustrations on items such as book covers and st soldiers of the royal irish regiment of the british army use the shamrock as their emblem , and wear a sprig of shamrock on saint patrick 's day linnaeus based his information that the irish ate shamrock on the comments of english elizabethan authors such as edmund spenser who remarked that the shamrock used to be eaten by the irish , especially in times of hardship and famine since the acts of union 1800 between britain and ireland the shamrock was incorporated into the royal coat of arms of the united kingdom , depicted growing from a single stem alongside the rose of england , and the thistle of scotland to symbolise the unity of the three kingdoms it has since been argued however , that the elizabethans were confused by the similarity between the irish ( gaelic ) name for young clover seamróg , and the name for wood sorrel seamsóg file : aer lingus regional atr 72 arrives birmingham airport , england 27june2019 arp.jpg shamrock on the tail fin of an atr 72 of aer lingus regional the shamrock is used in the emblems of many state organisations , both in the republic of ireland and northern ireland for example , the shamrock appeared on many buildings in ireland as a decorative motif , such as on the facade of the kildare street club building in dublin , st queen victoria decreed over a hundred years ago that soldiers from ireland should wear a sprig of shamrock in recognition of fellow irish soldiers who had fought bravely in the boer war , a tradition continued by british army soldiers from both the north and the south of ireland following partition in 1921 since then , the shamrock has regularly appeared alongside the rose , thistle and ( sometimes ) leek for wales in british coins such as the two shilling and crown , and in stamps
