on the recommendation of george frederick , margrave of brandenburg-ansbach , he was admitted to the margrave 's academy in heilsbronn in 1586 , where he studied until 1601 however , the margrave wrote a letter of recommendation on may 22 , 1601 , so that marius could study in prague under tycho brahe , which he did for several months , although he may actually have worked directly with david fabricius instead of brahe himself in 1606 , marius married felicitas lauer ( born 1590 ) , the daughter of his publisher , in ansbach , and in 1609 he published the first german translations of euclid 's elements that year , he also built his own telescope and in november made observations of the galilean moons , slightly before galileo did himself , which became the source of a major dispute between the two capra published another book in 1607 which he actually plagiarised from galileo , and marius was implicated in the act due to his prior association with capra , even though this was after marius had left padua galileo certainly was under that impression , as he referred to his '' old adversary '' ( without explicitly naming marius ) as a '' poisonous reptile '' , and an '' enemy of all mankind '' in 1614 , marius published his work mundus iovialis describing the planet jupiter and its moons ( he previously had published the discovery in 1611 in a local almanac ) marius used the julian calendar , and that date is equivalent to january 8 , 1610 , in the gregorian one used by galileo , one day after galileo 's letter in which he first described the moons discussion of marius ' work is scarce , but what exists tends to note his skill as an observer , including : that in 1612 he measured the diameter of the andromeda nebula and discerned it as having a dull , pale light which increased in brightness toward its center , bond , george p 190â€“191 that , from his observations of the galilean moons he derived better periods of revolution and other orbital elements for them than did galileo
