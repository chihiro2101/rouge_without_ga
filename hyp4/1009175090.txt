the fluid evolution of music that encompassed ska , rocksteady , reggae and dub was embraced by local music mixers who deconstructed and rebuilt tracks to suit the tastes of their audience at first , they simply dropped the vocal tracks , but soon more sophisticated effects were created , dropping separate instrumental tracks in and out of the mix , isolating and repeating hooks , and adding various effects like echo , reverberation and delay the coldcut remix '' seven minutes of madness '' became one of the first commercially successful remixes , becoming a top fifteen hit in countries such as germany , the netherlands and the united kingdom these typically had a duration of six to seven minutes , and often consisted of the original song with 8 or 16 bars of instruments inserted , often after the second chorus ; some were as simplistic as two copies of the song stitched end to end as the cost and availability of new technologies allowed , many of the bands who were involved in their own production ( such as yellow magic orchestra , depeche mode , new order , erasure , and duran duran ) experimented with more intricate versions of the extended mix after the rise of dance music in the late 1980s , a new form of remix was popularised , where the vocals would be kept and the instruments would be replaced , often with matching backing in the house music idiom jesse saunders , known as the originator of house music , was the first producer to change the art of remixing by creating his own original music , entirely replacing the earlier track , then mixing back in the artist 's original lyrics to make his remix another clear example of this approach is roberta flack 's 1989 ballad '' uh-uh ooh-ooh look out ( here it comes ) '' , which chicago house great steve '' silk '' hurley dramatically reworked into a boisterous floor-filler by stripping away all the instrumental tracks and substituting a minimalist , sequenced '' track '' to underpin her vocal delivery , remixed for the uk release which reached no1 pop by simon harris the art of the remix gradually evolved , and soon more avant-garde artists such as aphex twin were creating more experimental remixes of songs ( relying on the groundwork of cabaret voltaire and the others ) , which varied radically from their original sound and were not guided by pragmatic considerations such as sales or '' danceability '' , but were created for '' art 's sake '' in the 1990s , with the rise of powerful home computers with audio capabilities came the mash-up , an unsolicited , unofficial ( and often legally dubious ) remix created by '' underground remixers '' who edit two or more recordings ( often of wildly different songs ) together some artists ( such as björk , nine inch nails , and public enemy ) embraced this trend and outspokenly sanctioned fan remixing of their work ; there was once a web site which hosted hundreds of unofficial remixes of björk 's songs , all made using only various officially sanctioned mixes some industrial groups allow , and often encourage , their fans to remix their music , notably nine inch nails , whose website contains a list of downloadable songs that can be remixed using apple 's garageband software the main single of i turn to you by melanie c , was released as the '' hex hector radio mix '' , for which hex hector won the 2001 grammy as remixer of the year in 1988 , sinéad o'connor 's art-rock song '' i want your ( hands on me ) '' was remixed to emphasize the urban appeal of the composition ( the original contains a tight , grinding bassline and a rhythm guitar not entirely unlike chic 's work ) in 1989 , the cure 's '' pictures of you '' was remixed turning '' the music on its head , twisted the beat completely , but at the same time left the essential heart of the song intact an r & b remix usually has the same music as the original song but has added or altered verses that are rapped or sung by the featured artists in the early 1990s , mariah carey became one of the first mainstream artists who re-recorded vocals for a dancefloor version , and by 1993 most of her major dance and urban-targeted versions had been re-sung , e.g some of the song 's r & b elements were removed for the remix , while the bassline and '' genius of love '' sample were emphasized and the bridge from the original version was used as the chorus the '' bad boy fantasy remix '' , combines the chorus from the original version and the chorus of the bad boy remix together , removing ol ' dirty bastard 's vocals from his second verse sasha frere-jones , editor of the new yorker commented in referencing to the song 's remix : '' it became standard for r & b/hip-hop stars like missy elliott and beyoncé , to combine melodies with rapped verses '' john norris of mtv news has stated that the remix was '' responsible for , i would argue , an entire wave of music that we 've seen since and that is the r & b-hip-hop collaboration '' mayard also expressed that '' to this day odb and mariah may still be the best and most random hip hop collaboration of all time '' , citing that due to the record '' fantasy '' , '' r & b and hip hop were the best of step siblings the song is unique in that it segues from the end of the original to the beginning of the remixed version ( accompanied by the line '' now usually i do n't do this , but uh , go ahead on , break em ' off with a little preview of the remix in addition , the original version 's beginning line '' you remind me of something/i just ca n't think of what it is '' is actually sampled from an older kelly song , '' you remind me of something '' madonna 's i 'm breathless featured a remix of '' now i 'm following you '' that was used to segue from the original to '' vogue '' so that the latter could be added to the set without jarring the listener in 2015 , edm artist deadmau5 , who worked with jay-z 's roc nation , tried to sue his former manager for remixing his songs without permission , claiming that he gave his manager the go-ahead to use his work for some remixes , but not others many hip-hop remixes arose either from the need for a pop/r & b singer to add more of an urban , rap edge to one of their slower songs , or from a rapper 's desire to gain more pop appeal by collaborating with an r & b singer thanks to a combination of guest raps , re-sung or altered lyrics and alternative backing tracks , some hip-hop remixes can end up being almost entirely different songs from the originals an example is the remix of '' ai n't it funny '' by jennifer lopez , which has little in common with the original recording apart from the title these remixes proved hugely influential , notably lisa stansfield 's classic single '' change '' would be aired by urban radio in the knuckles version , which had been provided as an alternative to the original mix by ian devaney and andy morris , the record 's producers interviewed by the paris review , burroughs explained the following : '' a friend , brion gysin , an american poet and painter , who has lived in europe for thirty years , was , as far as i know , the first to create cut-ups a parody in contemporary usage , is a work created to mock , comment on , or make fun at an original work , its subject , author , style , or some other target , by means of humorous , satiric or ironic imitation the internet has allowed for art to be remixed quite easily , as evidenced by sites like memgenerator.net ( provides pictorial template upon which any words may be written by various anonymous users ) , and dan walsh 's garfieldminusgarfield.net ( removes the main character from various original strips by garfield creator jim davis ) examples include barbara kruger 's you are not yourself ( 1982 ) , we are not what we seem ( 1988 ) , and your body is a battleground ( 1989 ) barbara kruger , orlan 's ( 1994 ) self-hybridizations orlan , evelin stermitz 's remix , women at war ( 2010 ) , and distaff ain ’ t i redux ( 2008 ) by artist sian amoy the most important question is whether a remixer is free to redistribute his or her work , or whether the remix falls under the category of a derivative work according to , for example , united states copyright law if the song is substantively dissimilar in form ( for example , it might only borrow a motif which is modified , and be completely different in all other respects ) , then it may not necessarily be a derivative work ( depending on how heavily modified the melody and chord progressions were ) on the other hand , if the remixer only changes a few things ( for example , the instrument and tempo ) , then it is clearly a derivative work and subject to the copyrights of the original work 's copyright holder remixes will inevitably encounter legal problems when the whole or a substantial part of the original material has been reproduced , copied , communicated , adapted or performed – unless a permission has been given in advance through a voluntary open content license like a creative commons license , there is fair dealing involved ( the scope of which is extraordinarily narrow ) , a statutory license exists , or permission has been sought and obtained from the copyright owner generally , the courts consider what will amount to a substantial part by reference to its quality , as opposed to quantity and the importance the part taken bears in relation to the work as whole nicolas suzor believes that copyright law should be reformed in such a manner as to allow certain reuses of copyright material without the permission of the copyright owner where those derivatives are highly transformative and do not impact upon the primary market of the copyright owner there certainly appears to be a strong argument that non commercial derivatives , which do not compete with the market for the original material , should be afforded some defense to copyright actions material borrowed falls under fair use depending on the amount of original content used , the nature of the content , the purpose of the borrowed content , and the effect the borrowed content has on an audience the key word in such considerations is transformative , as the remix product must have been either sufficiently altered or clearly used for a sufficiently different purpose for it to be safe from copyright violation
