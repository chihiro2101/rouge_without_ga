according to christopher beam , the internship included an all-access pass to the affluent lifestyle that brooks had previously mocked , including yachting expeditions , bach concerts , dinners at buckley 's park avenue apartment and villa in stamford , connecticut , and a constant stream of writers , politicians , and celebrities the book , a paean to consumerism , argued that the new managerial or '' new upper class '' represents a marriage between the liberal idealism of the 1960s and the self-interest of the 1980s '' in 2004 , brooks ' book on paradise drive : how we live now ( and always have ) in the future tense was published as a sequel to his 2000 best seller , bobos in paradise , but it was not as well received as its predecessor when asked what he thinks of charges that he 's '' not a real conservative '' or '' squishy '' , brooks has said that '' if you define conservative by support for the republican candidate or the belief that tax cuts are the correct answer to all problems , i guess i do n't fit that agenda '' in fact , brooks read burke 's work while he was an undergraduate at the university of chicago and '' completely despised it '' , but '' gradually over the next five to seven years '' in september 2012 , brooks talked about being criticized from the conservative side , saying , '' if it 's from a loon , i do n't mind it '' with respect to whether he was '' the liberals ' favorite conservative '' brooks said he '' did n't care '' , stating : '' i do n't mind liberals praising me , but when it 's the really partisan liberals , you get an avalanche of love , it 's like uhhh , i got ta rethink this '' he recounts that a turning point in his thinking came while he was still an undergraduate , when he was selected to present the socialist point of view during a televised debate with nobel laureate free-market economist milton friedman '' citing the robb-silberman report , brooks rejected as a '' fable '' the idea that '' intelligence about iraqi weapons of mass destruction was all cooked by political pressure , that there was a big political conspiracy to lie us into war david brooks : sarah palin is a 'joke ' , tpmtv

may know a policy area better than me , they generally do n't know political philosophy better than me i remember distinctly an image of – we were sitting on his couches , and i was looking at his pant leg and his perfectly creased pant , and i 'm thinking , a ) he 's going to be president and b ) he 'll be a very good president '' two days after obama 's second autobiography , the audacity of hope , hit bookstores , brooks published a column in the new york times , titled '' run , barack , run '' , urging the chicago politician to run for president however , in december 2011 , during a c-span interview , brooks expressed a more tempered opinion of obama 's presidency , giving obama only a '' b- '' , and saying that obama 's chances of re-election would be less than 50–50 if elections were held at that time '' however , in a february 2016 new york times op-ed , brooks admitted that he missed obama during the 2016 primary season , admiring the president 's '' integrity '' and '' humanity '' , among other characteristics his op-ed in the new york times titled '' the nature of poverty '' specifically followed the social uproar caused by the death of freddie gray , and concluded that federal spending is not the issue impeding the progress of poverty reforms , but rather that the impediments to upward mobility are '' matters of social psychology '' in regard to the 2016 election , brooks spoke in support of hillary clinton , applauding her ability to be '' competent '' and '' normal '' in comparison to her republican counterpart , donald trump when discussing

, he is optimistic about the united states ' social stability , which he considers to be '' in the middle of an amazing moment of improvement and repair '' '' in 2020 , brooks wrote in the atlantic , under the headline '' the nuclear family was a mistake '' , that '' recent signs suggest at least the possibility that a new family paradigm is emerging , '' suggesting that in the place of the '' collapsed '' nuclear one the '' extended '' family emerges , with '' multigenerational living arrangements '' that stretch even '' across kinship lines '' brooks had already started in 2017 a project called '' weave '' , in order , as he described it , to '' support and draw attention to people and organizations around the country who are building community '' and to '' repair america ’ s social fabric , which is badly frayed by distrust , division and exclusion '' brooks also takes a moderate position on abortion , which he thinks should be legal , but with parental consent for minors , during the first four or five months , and illegal afterward , except in extremely rare circumstances brooks relates that he smoked it in his youth but quit after a humiliating incident : brooks smoked marijuana during lunch hour at school and felt embarrassed during a class presentation that afternoon in which he says he was incapable of intelligible speech he reported brooks as insisting that the book was not intended to be factual but to report his impressions of what he believed an area to be like : '' he laughed brooks does not let the sociology get in the way of the shtick , and he wields a mean shoehorn when he needs the theory to fit the joke '' writing for gawker , which consistently criticized brooks ' work , opinion writer tom scocca argued that brooks does not use facts and statistics to support his policy positions , noting '' possibly that is because he perceives facts and statistics as an opportunity for dishonest people to work mischief '' furthermore , annie lowrey , in writing for the new york magazine , criticized brooks ' statistical methods when arguing his stance on political reform , claiming he used '' some very tricksy , misleading math ''
