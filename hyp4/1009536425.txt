the f-number n is given by : : n \frac\right ) n , where n is the uncorrected f-number , na i is the image-space numerical aperture of the lens , m is the absolute value of the lens 's magnification for an object a particular distance away , and p is the pupil magnification in the following quote , an '' apertal ratio '' of '' '' is calculated as the ratio of to , corresponding to an f-stop : in every lens there is , corresponding to a given apertal ratio ( that is , the ratio of the diameter of the stop to the focal length ) , a certain distance of a near object from it , between which and infinity all objects are in equally good focus in the same lens , the focal range will depend upon the size of the diaphragm used , while in different lenses having the same apertal ratio the focal ranges will be greater as the focal length of the lens is increased in 1874 , john henry dallmeyer called the ratio 1/n the '' intensity ratio '' of a lens : the rapidity of a lens depends upon the relation or ratio of the aperture to the equivalent focus to ascertain this , divide the equivalent focus by the diameter of the actual working aperture of the lens in question ; and note down the quotient as the denominator with 1 , or unity , for the numerator thus to find the ratio of a lens of 2 inches diameter and 6 inches focus , divide the focus by the aperture , or 6 divided by 2 equals 3 ; i.e dallmeyer knew that his working aperture was not the same as the physical diameter of the aperture stop : it must be observed , however , that in order to find the real intensity ratio , the diameter of the actual working aperture must be ascertained this is easily accomplished in the case of single lenses , or for double combination lenses used with the full opening , these merely requiring the application of a pair of compasses or rule ; but when double or triple-combination lenses are used , with stops inserted between the combinations , it is somewhat more troublesome ; for it is obvious that in this case the diameter of the stop employed is not the measure of the actual pencil of light transmitted by the front combination make a small round hole in the centre of the cardboard with a piercer , and now remove to a darkened room ; apply a candle close to the hole , and observe the illuminated patch visible upon the front combination ; the diameter of this circle , carefully measured , is the actual working aperture of the lens in question for the particular stop employed at the same time , there were a number of aperture numbering systems designed with the goal of making exposure times vary in direct or inverse proportion with the aperture , rather than with the square of the f-number or inverse square of the apertal ratio or intensity ratio welborne piper , a first book of the lens : an elementary treatise on the action and use of the photographic lens , london : hazell , watson , and viney , ltd in modern publications , the forms f-number and f number are more common , though the earlier forms , as well as f-number are still found in a few books ; not uncommonly , the initial lower-case f in f-number or f/number is set in a hooked italic form : f , or f
