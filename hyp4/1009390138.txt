then , the serum to be tested is applied in the primary antibody incubation step ; free antibody is washed away , and a secondary anti-human antibody linked to an enzyme signal is added a western blot is also used as the definitive test for variant creutzfeldt-jakob disease , a type of prion disease linked to the consumption of contaminated beef from cattle with bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( bse , commonly referred to as 'mad cow disease ' ) the western blot method is composed of a gel electrophoresis to separate native proteins by 3-d structure or denatured proteins by the length of the polypeptide , followed by an electrophoretic transfer onto a membrane ( mostly pvdf or nitrocellulose ) and an immunostaining procedure to visualize a certain protein on the blot membrane sds is generally used as a buffer ( as well as in the gel ) in order to give all proteins present a uniform negative charge , since proteins can be positively , negatively , or neutrally charged following electrophoretic separation , the proteins are transferred to a membrane ( typically nitrocellulose or pvdf ) , where they are blocked with milk ( or other blocking agents ) to prevent non-specific antibody binding , and then stained with antibody specific to the target protein lastly , the membrane will be stained with a secondary antibody that recognizes the first antibody staining , which can then be used for detection by a variety of methods one lane is usually reserved for a marker or ladder , which is a commercially available mixture of proteins of known molecular weights , typically stained so as to form visible , coloured bands to make the proteins accessible to antibody detection , they are moved from within the gel onto a membrane made of nitrocellulose ( nc ) or polyvinylidene difluoride ( pvdf ) total protein staining allows the total protein that has been successfully transferred to the membrane to be visualised , allowing the user to check the uniformity of protein transfer and to perform subsequent normalization of the target protein with the actual protein amount per lane since the membrane has been chosen for its ability to bind protein and as both antibodies and the target are proteins , steps must be taken to prevent the interactions between the membrane and the antibody used for detection of the target protein blocking of non-specific binding is achieved by placing the membrane in a dilute solution of protein – typically 3–5 % bovine serum albumin ( bsa ) or powdered milk ( both are inexpensive ) in tris-buffered saline ( tbs ) or i-block , with a minute percentage ( 0.1 % ) of detergent such as tween 20 or triton x-100 thus , when the antibody is added , it can not bind to the membrane , and therefore the only available binding site is the specific target protein during the detection process the membrane is '' probed '' for the protein of interest with a modified antibody which is linked to a reporter enzyme ; when exposed to an appropriate substrate , this enzyme drives a colorimetric reaction and produces a color after blocking , a solution of primary antibody ( generally between 0.5 and 5 micrograms/ml ) diluted in either pbs or tbst wash buffer is incubated with the membrane under gentle agitation for typically an hour at room temperature , or overnight at 4°c it can also be incubated at different temperatures , with lesser temperatures being associated with more binding , both specific ( to the target protein , the '' signal '' ) and non-specific ( '' noise '' ) to allow detection of the target protein , the secondary antibody is commonly linked to biotin or a reporter enzyme such as alkaline phosphatase or horseradish peroxidase this means that several secondary antibodies will bind to one primary antibody and enhance the signal , allowing the detection of proteins of a much lower concentration than would be visible by sds-page alone therefore , the production of luminescence is proportional to the amount of hrp-conjugated secondary antibody , and therefore , indirectly measures the presence of the target protein as with the elispot and elisa procedures , the enzyme can be provided with a substrate molecule that will be converted by the enzyme to a colored reaction product that will be visible on the membrane ( see the figure below with blue bands ) the light produced from the excitation of a fluorescent dye is static , making fluorescent detection a more precise and accurate measure of the difference in the signal produced by labeled antibodies bound to proteins on a western blot proteins can be accurately quantified because the signal generated by the different amounts of proteins on the membranes is measured in a static state , as compared to chemiluminescence , in which light is measured in a dynamic state a third alternative is to use a radioactive label rather than an enzyme coupled to the secondary antibody , such as labeling an antibody-binding protein like staphylococcus protein a or streptavidin with a radioactive isotope of iodine since other methods are safer , quicker , and cheaper , this method is now rarely used ; however , an advantage of this approach is the sensitivity of auto-radiography-based imaging , which enables highly accurate protein quantification when combined with optical software ( e.g given the advent of high-throughput protein analysis and lower limits of detection , however , there has been interest in developing one-step probing systems that would allow the process to occur faster and with fewer consumables the primary probe is incubated with the membrane in a manner similar to that for the primary antibody in a two-step process , and then is ready for direct detection after a series of wash steps after the unbound probes are washed away , the western blot is ready for detection of the probes that are labeled and bound to the protein of interest the colorimetric detection method depends on incubation of the western blot with a substrate that reacts with the reporter enzyme ( such as peroxidase ) that is bound to the secondary antibody radioactive labels do not require enzyme substrates , but rather , allow the placement of medical x-ray film directly against the western blot , which develops as it is exposed to the label and creates dark regions which correspond to the protein bands of interest ( see image above ) the fluorescently labeled probe is excited by light and the emission of the excitation is then detected by a photosensor such as a ccd camera equipped with appropriate emission filters which captures a digital image of the western blot and allows further data analysis such as molecular weight analysis and a quantitative western blot analysis
