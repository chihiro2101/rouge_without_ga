because optical mice render movement based on an image which the led ( or infrared diode ) lighting , use with multicolored mouse pads may result in unreliable performance ; however , laser mice do not suffer these problems and will track on such surfaces . this advance enabled the mouse to detect relative motion on a wide variety of surfaces , translating the movement of the mouse into the movement of the cursor and eliminating the need for a special mouse-pad lyon of xerox , used a 16-pixel visible-light image sensor with integrated motion detection on the same ntype ( 5µm ) mos integrated circuit chip , and tracked the motion of light dots in a dark field of a printed paper or similar mouse pad glass laser ( or glaser ) mice have the same capability of a laser mouse but work far better on mirror or transparent glass surfaces than other optical mice on those surfaces though not commonly referred to as optical mice , nearly all mechanical mice tracked movement using leds and photodiodes to detect when beams of infrared light did and did n't pass through holes in a pair of incremental rotary encoder wheels ( one for left/right , another for forward/back ) , driven by a rubberized ball thus , the primary distinction of “ optical mice ” is not their use of optics , but their complete lack of moving parts to track mouse movement , instead employing an entirely solid-state system unlike mechanical mice , whose tracking mechanisms can become clogged with lint , optical mice have no moving parts ( besides buttons and scroll wheels ) ; therefore , they do not require maintenance other than removing debris that might collect under the light emitter the kirsch and lyon mouse types had very different behaviors , as the kirsch mouse used an x-y coordinate system embedded in the pad , and would not work correctly when the pad was rotated , while the lyon mouse used the x-y coordinate system of the mouse body , as mechanical mice do modern surface-independent optical mice work by using an optoelectronic sensor ( essentially , a tiny low-resolution video camera ) to take successive images of the surface on which the mouse operates , position measurement ) principles based on detecting and correlating microscopic , inherent features of the surface over which the navigation sensor travelled , and using position measurements of each end of a linear ( document ) image sensor to reconstruct an image of the document ) required resolution by the optical navigators on the order of 1/600th of an inch , implementation of optical position measurement in computer mice not only benefit from the cost reductions inherent in navigating at lower resolution , but also enjoy the advantage of visual feedback to the user of the cursor position on the computer display the first two optical mice , first demonstrated by two independent inventors in december 1980 , had different basic designs : one of these , invented by steve kirsch of mit and mouse systems corporation , used an infrared led and a four-quadrant infrared sensor to detect grid lines printed with infrared absorbing ink on a special metallic surface however , laser mice did not enter the mainstream consumer market until 2004 , following the development by a team at agilent laboratories , palo alto , led by doug baney of a laser-based mouse based on a 850 & nbsp ; nm vcsel ( laser ) that offered 20x improvement in tracking performance the color of the optical mouse 's leds can vary , but red is most common , as red diodes are inexpensive and silicon photodetectors are very sensitive to red light this mouse uses a small infrared laser ( vcsel ) instead of an led and has significantly increased the resolution of the image taken by the mouse by describing an optical means that explicitly overcame the limitations of wheels , balls , and rollers used in contemporary computer mice , the optical mouse was anticipated some mice , such as the logitech v450 848 & nbsp ; nm laser mouse , are capable of functioning on two aa batteries for a full year , due to the low power requirements of the infrared laser optical models outperform mechanical mice on uneven , slick , soft , sticky , or loose surfaces , and generally in mobile situations lacking mouse pads
