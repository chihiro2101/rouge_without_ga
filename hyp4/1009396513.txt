the eddystone rocks are an extensive reef approximately 12 miles ( 19 & nbsp ; km ) ssw off plymouth sound , one of the most important naval harbours of england , and midway between lizard point , cornwall and start point they are submerged at high spring tides and were so feared by mariners entering the english channel that they often hugged the coast of france to avoid the danger , which thus resulted not only in shipwrecks locally , but on the rocks of the north coast of france and the channel islands 01 : winstanley ’ s light ( painting 1699 – 1703 ) the lighthouse survived its first winter but was in need of repair , and was subsequently changed to a dodecagonal ( 12 sided ) stone clad exterior on a timber framed construction with an octagonal top section as can be seen in the later drawings or paintings the vertical wooden planks which sheathed the structure were installed by two master-shipwrights and caulked like those of a ship ; and the whole structure was anchored to the reef using thirty-six wrought iron bolts forged to fit deep holes which had been machine-cut in the reef on the night of 2 december 1755 , the top of the lantern caught fire , probably through a spark from one of the candles used to illuminate the light , or else through a fracture in the chimney which passed through the lantern from the stove in the kitchen below a report on this case was submitted to the royal society by physician edward spry , and the piece of lead is now in the collections of the national museums of scotland recommended by the royal society , civil engineer john smeaton modelled the shape on an oak tree , the foundations and outside structure built of local cornish granite , and lighter portland limestone masonry used on the inside this was the first time that a fully catadioptric large optic ( using prisms rather than mirrors above and below the lens ) had been constructed , and the first such installation in any lighthouse a new lantern was constructed and fitted to the top of the tower in 1848 , as the original had proved unsatisfactory for housing the new optic the foundations and stub of the tower remain , close to the new and more solid foundations of the current lighthouse – the foundations proved too strong to be dismantled so the victorians left them where they stood by july 1878 the new site , on the south rock was being prepared during the 3½ hours between ebb and flood tide ; the foundation stone was laid on 19 august the following year by hrh the duke of edinburgh , master of trinity house the supply ship hercules was based at oreston , now a suburb of plymouth ; stone was prepared at the oreston yard and supplied from the works of messrs shearer , smith and co of wadebridge at the time the eddystone 's extra-tall lenses were the largest in existence ; their superior height was achieved through the use of extra-dense flint glass in the upper and lower portions of each panel on clear nights , only the lamp in the lower tier of lenses was lit ( producing a light of 37,000 candlepower ) ; in poor visibility , however ( judged by whether the plymouth breakwater was visible ) , both lamps were used at full power , to provide a 159,600 candlepower light in addition to the main light a fixed white light was shone from a room on the eighth storey of the tower ( using a pair of argand lamps and reflectors ) in the direction of the hazardous hand deeps following the invention of the mercury bath system ( allowing a lighthouse optic to revolve in a trough of mercury rather than on rollers ) the eddystone lens pedestal was duly upgraded and the drive mechanism replaced later , in 1959 the light was electrified and the current smaller ( fourth-order ) 'bi-valve ' optic was installed ; at the same time a 'air horn ' fog signal was installed , with compressors powered from the diesel generators the lighthouse inspired a sea shanty , frequently recorded , that begins '' my father was the keeper of the eddystone light / and he slept with a mermaid one fine night / from this union there came three / a porpoise and a porgy and the other was me ! '' the lighthouse is referenced twice in herman melville 's epic novel moby-dick ; at the beginning of chapter 14 , '' nantucket '' : '' how it stands there , away off shore , more lonely than the eddystone lighthouse '' , and in chapter 133 , '' the chase – first day '' : '' so , in a gale , the but half baffled channel billows only recoil from the base of the eddystone , triumphantly to overleap its summit with their scud
