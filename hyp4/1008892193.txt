the most basic form of platform consists of an area at the same level as the track , usually resulting in a fairly large height difference between the platform and the train floor occasionally the platform is higher than the train floor , where a train with a low floor serves a station built for trains with a high floor , for example at the dutch stations of the db regionalbahn westfalen ( see a tram stop is often in the middle of the street ; usually it has as a platform a refuge area of a similar height to that of the sidewalk , e.g a railway station may be served by heavy-rail and light-rail vehicles with lower floors and have a dual- height platform , as on the rijngouwelijn in the netherlands some , such as , use letters instead of numbers ( this is to distinguish the platforms from numbered ones in the adjoining london waterloo station for staff who work at both stations ) ; some , such as paris-gare de lyon , use letters for one group of platforms but numbers for the other in the us , a designated place where a train can arrive is referred to as a '' track '' ( e.g the term '' platform '' is also used in the us but refers to the structure rather than a designated place for a train arriving a variety of information is presented , including destinations and times ( for all trains , or only the more important long-distance trains ) , delays , cancellations , platform changes , changes in routes and destinations , the number of carriages in the train and the location of first class or luggage compartments , and supplementary fee or reservation requirements in high-speed rail , passing trains are a significant safety problem as the safe distance from the platform edge increases with the speed of the passing train a study done by the united states department of transportation in 1999 found that trains passing station platforms at speeds of can pose safety concerns to passengers on the platforms who are away from the edge due to the aerodynamic effects created by pressure and induced airflow with speeds of to depending on the train body aerodynamic designs in united kingdom , a guideline for platform safety specifies that for the platforms with train passing speeds between and , there should be a yellow-line buffer zone of and other warning signs the european union has a regulation for platforms that are close to tracks with train passing speeds of or more should not be accessible to passengers unless there is a lower speed limit for trains that intend to stop at the station or there are barriers to limit access in the us , americans with disabilities act of 1990 regulations require a detectable warning strip wide , consisting of truncated dome bumps in a visually-contrasting color , for the full length of the platform
