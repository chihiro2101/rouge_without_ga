hidalgo was the second-born child of don cristóbal hidalgo y costilla espinoza de los monteros and doña ana maría gallaga mandarte villaseñor , both criollos in 1759 , charles iii of spain ascended to the throne of spain ; he soon sent out a visitor-general with the power to investigate and reform all parts of colonial government at the age of fifteen hidalgo was sent to valladolid ( now morelia ) , michoacán , to study at the colegio de san francisco javier with the jesuits , along with his brothers when the jesuits were expelled from mexico in 1767 , he entered the colegio de san nicolás , where he studied for the priesthood after this , he went to the royal and pontifical university of mexico in mexico city for further study , earning his degree in philosophy and theology in 1773 hidalgo 's study of french allowed him to read and study works of the enlightenment current in europe but , at the same time , forbidden by the catholic church in mexico from 1779 to 1792 , he dedicated himself to teaching at the colegio de san nicolás obispo in valladolid ( now morelia ) ; it was '' one of the most important educational centers of the viceroyalty the church sent him to work at the parishes of colima and san felipe , guanajuato until he became the parish priest in dolores , guanajuato , succeeding his brother josé joaquín a few weeks afrter his death on 19 september 1802 although hidalgo had a traditional education for the priesthood , as an educator at the colegio de san nicolás he had innovated in teaching methods and curriculum he questioned the absolute authority of the spanish king and challenged numerous ideas presented by the church , including the power of the popes , the virgin birth , and clerical celibacy as a secular cleric , he was not bound by a vow of poverty , so he , like many other secular priests , pursued business activities , including owning three haciendas ; guedea , '' miguel hidalgo y costilla '' , p allende was in charge of convincing hidalgo to join his movement , since the priest of dolores had friendship with very influential characters from all over the bajío and even from new spain , such as juan antonio riaño , mayor of guanajuato , and manuel abad y queipo bishop of michoacán in 1803 , aged 50 , he arrived in dolores accompanied by his family that included a younger brother , a cousin , two half sisters , as well as maría and their two children fearing his arrest , hidalgo commanded his brother mauricio , as well as ignacio allende and mariano abasolo , to go with a number of other armed men to make the sheriff release prison inmates in dolores on the night of 15 september 1810 there he gave what is now known as the grito de dolores ( cry of dolores ) , calling the people of his parish to leave their homes and join with him in a rebellion against the current government , in the name of their king hidalgo 's grito did not condemn the notion of monarchy or criticize the current social order in detail , but his opposition to the events in spain and the current viceregal government was clearly expressed in his reference to bad government many villagers that joined the insurgent army came to believe that fernando vii himself commanded their loyalty to hidalgo and the monarch was in new spain personally directing the rebellion against his own government they marched through the bajío area , through atotonilco , san miguel el grande ( present-day san miguel de allende ) , chamucuero , celaya , salamanca , irapuato and silao , to guanajuato from valladolid , they marched through the state of mexico , through the cities of maravatio , ixtlahuaca , toluca coming as close to mexico city as the monte de las cruces , between the valley of toluca and the valley of mexico one of the first stops was at the sanctuary of nuestra señora de guadalupe in atotonilco , where hidalgo affixed an image of the virgin to a lance to adopt it as his banner he inscribed the following slogans to his troops ’ flags : '' long live religion ! long live our most holy mother of guadalupe ! long live america and death to bad government ! '' for the insurgents as a whole , the virgin represented an intense and highly localized religious sensibility , invoked more to identify allies rather than create ideological alliances or a sense of nationalism on 28 september 1810 , hidalgo arrived at the city of guanajuato with rebels , who were , for the most part , armed with sticks , stones , and machetes here , hidalgo issued proclamations against the peninsulares , whom he accused of arrogance and despotism , as well as enslaving those in the americas for almost 300 & nbsp ; years hidalgo argued that the objective of the war was '' to send the gachupines back to the motherland '' because their greed and tyranny lead to the temporal and spiritual degradation of the mexicans hidalgo and his troops left the state of michoacán and marched through the towns of maravatio , ixtlahuaca , and toluca before stopping in the forested mountain area of monte de las cruces left after the battle of monte de las cruces on 30 october 1810 , hidalgo still had some 100,000 insurgents and was in a strategic position to attack mexico city hidalgo found the sedentary indians and castes of the valley of mexico as much opposed to the insurgents as were the creoles and spaniards he named pascacio ortiz de letona as representative of the insurgent government and sent him to the united states to seek support there , but ortiz de letona was apprehended by the spanish army en route to philadelphia and promptly executed bishop abad y queipo had formerly been a friend of hidalgo and also worked for the welfare of the people , but the bishop was adamantly opposed to hidalgo 's tactics and the resultant disruptions , alleged '' sacrileges '' and purported ill-treatment of priests the inquisition pronounced an edict against him with charges including denying that god punishes sins in this world , doubting the authenticity of the bible , denouncing the popes and church government , allowing jews not to convert to christianity , denying the perpetual virginity of mary , preaching that there was no hell , and adopting lutheran doctrine with regard to the eucharist hidalgo had between 80,000 & nbsp ; and & nbsp ; 100,000 men and 95 & nbsp ; cannons , but the better trained royalists decisively defeated the insurgent army , forcing hidalgo to flee towards aguascalientes a short time later , they were betrayed and captured by royalist ignacio elizondo at the wells of baján ( norias de baján ) on 21 march 1811 and taken to chihuahua there are many theories about how he was executed , the most famous that he was killed by firing squad in the morning of 30 july and then decapitated '' his body and the bodies of allende , aldama and josé mariano jiménez were decapitated , and the heads were put on display in the four corners of the alhóndiga de granaditas in guanajuato insurgent fighting evolved into guerrilla warfare , and eventually the next major insurgent leader , josé maría morelos , who had led rebel movements with hidalgo , became head of the insurgents , until morelos himself was captured and shot in 1815 '' miguel hidalgo y costilla had the unique distinction of being a father in three senses of the word : a priestly father in the roman catholic church , a biological father who produced illegitimate children in violation of his clerical vows , and the father of his country he has been hailed as the father of the nation even though it was agustín de iturbide and not hidalgo who achieved mexican independence in 1821 shortly after gaining independence , the day to celebrate it varied between 16 september , the day of hidalgo 's grito , and 27 september , the day iturbide rode into mexico city to end the war the reason for this is that hidalgo is considered to be '' precursor and creator of the rest of the heroes of the ( mexican war of ) independence file : angel de la independencia mexico city.jpg hidalgo was laid to rest at the base of the angel of independence , mexico city file : orozco hidalgo mural.jpg painting of hidalgo , by josé clemente orozco , jalisco governmental palace , guadalajara file : miguel hidalgo ( 2 ) by claudio linati 1828.jpeg romantic portrait , by claudio linati ( 1828 ) file : plazamiguelhidalgomeoquichihuahua.jpg don miguel hidalgo square and freedom route file : mexico.df.coyoacan.miguelhidalgo.statue.01.jpg statue at plaza hidalgo , coyoacán file : hidalgo aboliendo la esclavitud.jpg statue in guadalajara , jalisco file : maxico 10 pesos 1955 crown size silver coin ef.jpg commemorative silver coin mexico 10 pesos 1955
