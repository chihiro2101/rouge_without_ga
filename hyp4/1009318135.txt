it is applied on the active lesions until they heal off , but may also be used continuously in low doses ( twice a week ) , and applied to the thinner skin over the face and eyelids side effects can be severe and include infection , cardiac damage , hypertension , blurred vision , liver and kidney problems ( tacrolimus nephrotoxicity ) , hyperkalemia , hypomagnesemia , hyperglycemia , diabetes mellitus , itching , lung damage ( sirolimus also causes lung damage ) , and various neuropsychiatric problems such as loss of appetite , insomnia , posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome , confusion , weakness , depression , vivid nightmares , cramps , neuropathy , seizures , tremors , and catatonia the most common adverse events associated with the use of topical tacrolimus ointments , especially if used over a wide area , include a burning or itching sensation on the initial applications , with increased sensitivity to sunlight and heat on the affected areas tacrolimus and a related drug for eczema ( pimecrolimus ) were suspected of carrying a cancer risk , though the matter is still a subject of controversy macrolide antibiotics including erythromycin and clarithromycin , as well as several of the newer classes of antifungals , especially of the azole class ( fluconazole , voriconazole ) , increase tacrolimus levels by competing for cytochrome enzymes calcineurin then dephosphorylates the transcription factor nuclear factor of activated t-cells ( nf-at ) , which moves to the nucleus of the t-cell and increases the activity of genes coding for il-2 and related cytokines although short-term immunosuppression concerning patient and graft survival is found to be similar between the two drugs , tacrolimus results in a more favorable lipid profile , and this may have important long-term implications given the prognostic influence of rejection on graft survival across a large number of studies , individuals homozygous for the g allele have been shown to have higher concentrations of tacrolimus and require lower doses of the drug , as compared to individuals who are not homozygous for the g allele achieving target concentrations of tacrolimus is important â€“ if levels are too low , then there is a risk of transplant rejection , if levels are too high , there is a risk of drug toxicities however , there is a lack of consistent evidence as to whether dosing based on rs776746 genotype results in improved clinical outcomes ( such as a decreased risk for transplant rejection or drug toxicities ) , likely because patients taking tacrolimus are subject to therapeutic drug monitoring tacrolimus was discovered in 1987 ; it was among the first macrolide immunosuppressants discovered , preceded by the discovery of rapamycin ( sirolimus ) on rapa nui ( easter island ) in 1975 ) : protopic update 2005 tacrolimus was first approved by the us food and drug administration ( fda ) in 1994 , for use in liver transplantation ; the indications were extended to include kidney , heart , small bowel , pancreas , lung , trachea , skin , cornea , bone marrow , and limb transplants tacrolimus was approved for medical use in the european union in 2002 , for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in 2007 , the indications were expanded to include the prophylaxis of transplant rejection in adult kidney or liver allograft recipients and the treatment of allograft rejection resistant to treatment with other immunosuppressive medicinal products in adults in 2009 , the indications were expanded to include the prophylaxis of transplant rejection in adult and paediatric , kidney , liver or heart allograft recipients and the treatment of allograft rejection resistant to treatment with other immunosuppressive medicinal products in adults and children a branded version of the drug is owned by astellas pharma , and is sold under the brand name prograf , given twice daily the 19 genes are fkbq , fkbn , fkbm , fkbd , fkba , fkbp , fkbo , fkbb , fkbc , fkbl , fkbk , fkbj , fkbi , fkbh , fkbg , alld , allr , allk and alla the fundamental units for biosynthesis are following : one molecule of 4,5-dihydroxycyclohex-1-enecarboxylic acid ( dhchc ) as a starter unit , four molecules of malonyl-coa , five molecules of methylmalonyl-coa , one molecule of allylmalonyl-coa as elongation units
