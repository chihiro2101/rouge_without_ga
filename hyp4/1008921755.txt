according to cohen , there are five key stages in the construction of a moral panic : someone , something or a group are defined as a threat to social norms or community interests the threat is then depicted in a simple and recognizable symbol/form by the media the portrayal of this symbol rouses public concern there is a response from authorities and policy makers the moral panic over the issue results in social changes within the community in 1971 , cohen investigated a series of '' moral panics '' ) the idea of backmasking as a part of this moral panic began to enter the public discussion with the paul is dead rumor , which popularized the idea that messages recorded backwards in music contained messages by or about the artist , the focus of the topic would change in the 1970s : then , religious leaders in the united states began to claim that backmasking in music of the time , particularly rock music , glorified and promoted satanism through ways that could be accepted subconsciously , a rumor boosted by the film the exorcist , in which satanic backmasking was a plot point also known as the '' satanic panic '' , this was a series of moral panics regarding satanic ritual abuse that originated in the united states and spread to other english-speaking countries in the 1980s and 1990s , which led to a string of wrongful convictions cited in in '' rethinking 'moral panic ' for multi-mediated social worlds '' , angela mcrobbie and sarah thornton argued '' that it is now time that every stage in the process of constructing a moral panic , as well as the social relations which support it , should be revised the fear of disease ( or the fear of threats to public health ) and the spread of panic dates back many centuries and it continues to exist into the 21st century due to the existence and spread of diseases such as aids in mid-2018 , reports began emerging of a supposed '' suicide challenge '' dubbed the momo challenge , where people would be threatened

produced a moral panic far more fatal than the disease now is according to goode and ben-yehuda , moral panic consists of the following characteristics : concern – there must be the belief that the behavior of the group or activity deemed deviant is likely to have a negative effect on society there are also applications of the term to musical genres that to others would seem unusual or irrational to be labeled '' the devil 's music '' , such as country and christian rock , but these ideas never caught on like the above examples and today tend to not be common outside the aforementioned crank communities it is important to note the quick decline in political success for the know nothing-party as a result of a decline in concern for the perceived social threat , an indicative feature of the movements situated in moral panic in the 1990s and 2000s , there have been instances of moral panics in the united kingdom and the united states , related to colloquial uses

bringing about prior to the 20th century , an intense concentration on hygiene emerged with a medical belief which is referred to as the miasma theory , which stated that disease was the direct result of the polluting emanations of filth : sewer gas , garbage fumes , and stenches polluted air and water , resulting in epidemics paul joosse has argued that while classic moral panic theory styled itself as being part of the '' sceptical revolution '' that sought to critique structural functionalism , it is actually very similar to émile durkheim 's depiction of how the collective conscience is strengthened through its reactions to deviance ( in cohen 's case , for example , 'right-thinkers ' use folk devils to strengthen societal orthodoxies ) a condition , episode , person or group of persons emerges to become defined as a threat to society and interests '' authors behind aids : rights , risk , and reason argued that '' british tv and press coverage is locked into an agenda which blocks out any approach to the subject which does not conform in advance to the values and language of a profoundly homophobic culture—a culture that does not regard gay men as fully or properly human using as an example a peaceful and lawful protest staged by local mothers against the re-housing of sex-offenders on their estate , thompson and williams show how the sensationalist demonization of

that can only increase the level of collective anxiety some have speculated that the rock phase of the panic in the 1970s and 1980s contributed to the popularity of the satanic ritual abuse moral panic in the 1980s once it became clear that this was not the case , the moral panic created by the media changed to blaming the overall negligence of ethical standards by the younger generation ( both male and female ) , resulting in another moral panic writing in 1995 about the moral panic that arose in the uk after a series of murders by juveniles , chiefly that of two-year-old james bulger

child perpetrators would normally be thought of as innocent the media narrative of a sex offender , highlighting egregious offenses as typical behaviour of any sex offender , and media distorting the facts of some cases , has led legislators to attack judicial discretion , making sex offender registration mandatory based on certain listed offenses rather than individual risk or the actual severity of the crime , thus practically catching less serious offenders under the domain of harsh sex offender laws ; in policing the crisis : mugging , the state and law and order ( 1978 ) , stuart hall and his colleagues studied the public reaction to the phenomenon of robbery and the perception that it had recently been imported from american culture into the uk concerns from parts of the public about violent games led to cautionary , often exaggerated news stories , warnings from politicians and other public figures , and calls for research to prove the connection , which in turn led to studies ''

establishment anxieties about the '' sub-proletarian '' sector of british society displaced onto the folk devil of the '' dangerous dog '' they also suggest that the '' points of social control '' that moral panics used to rest on '' have undergone some degree of shift , if not transformation according to cohen , the media appear in any or all three roles in moral panic dramas : setting the
