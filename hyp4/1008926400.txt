questions for the 2011 census as including only the short-form questions ; this was published in the canada gazette on june 26 , 2010 , however a news release was not issued by minister of industry tony clement until july 13 , 2010 the minister of industry , tony clement initially indicated that these changes were being made based on consultations with statistics canada but was forced to admit that the change from a mandatory to voluntary form was not one of the recommendations received from statcan after the head of the organization munir sheikh resigned in protest information has since been uncovered that indicates attempts on the part of the government to distance themselves from the decision , instructing statistics canada officials to delete the phrase '' as per government decision '' from documents which were being written to inform statistics canada staff of the change the government has maintained its position , most recently expressed by lynn meahan , press secretary to the industry minister , that the new census will result in '' useable ( sic ) and useful data that can meet the needs of many users '' during the 2010 debates , the freedom party of ontario , a small group based on ayn rand 's writings , whose 42 candidates received 12,381 votes ( or 0.26 % of the popular vote ) in the 2014 election , opposed the long census many groups have made the claim that a voluntary system will not provide a quality of data consistent with what statistics canada is known for while others feel that politically motivated changes to statcan methodology taints the reputation of the whole organization in the international setting supporters of the change have offered models of european countries who are adopting alternate systems , although in these states the census is being replaced with a database of information on each citizen rather than a voluntary poll and none of these systems are planned for the canadian 2011 census according to the globe and mail , by 2015 an increasing number of economists joined organizations such as the canadian chamber of commerce , canadian federation of independent business , canadian economics association
