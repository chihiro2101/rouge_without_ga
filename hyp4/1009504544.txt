although two european thrushes , the song thrush and mistle thrush , are early offshoots from the eurasian lineage of turdus thrushes after they spread north from africa , the fieldfare is descended from ancestors that had colonised the caribbean islands from africa and subsequently reached europe from there the fieldfare is easily recognisable with its slate-grey head , nape and rump , dark brown back , blackish tail and boldly speckled breast the outer edge of each tail feather is fringed with grey near the base and the outer pair of feathers have a narrow white border on the inner edge the lower breast is creamy-white with a diminishing buff tinge and fewer speckles and the belly is similarly creamy-white , with the speckles restricted to the uppermost parts the primaries are brownish-black with the leading edge fringed grey and the inner edge of the outer feathers grey near the base whereas the inner feathers are fringed with brown near the base the female is very similar to the male but the upper parts are somewhat more brownish and the feathers on the crown have narrower black central stripes it is a mixture of a few phrases like those of the common blackbird ( turdus merula ) interspersed with whistles , guttural squeaks and call notes this is sung on the wing and also from a tree and a subdued version of this song with more warbling notes is sung by a group of birds at communal roosts it breeds in northern norway , northern sweden , finland , belgium , germany , switzerland , austria , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary , poland and siberia as far east as transbaikal , the aldan river and the tian shan mountains in north west china it is a vagrant to iceland , greenland , spitsbergen , the canary islands , the balearic islands , madeira , corsica , sardinia , sicily , malta and cyprus in the summer the fieldfare frequents mixed woodland of birch , alder , pine , spruce and fir , often near marshes , moorland or other open ground migration southwards from the breeding range starts in october but the bulk of birds arrive in the united kingdom in november the location is often in woodland but may be in a hedgerow , garden , among rocks , in a pile of logs , in a hut or on the ground the nest is built of dried grasses and weeds with a few twigs and a little moss , with a lining of mud and an inner lining of fine grasses there are usually five to six eggs in a clutch , but occasionally three , four , seven or eight eggs are laid they are usually ready to leave the nest after fourteen to sixteen days and there may be two broods in the season , especially in the southern parts of the breeding range the fieldfare has an extensive range , estimated at 10 & nbsp ; million & nbsp ; square kilometres ( 3.8 & nbsp ; million square miles ) , and a large population , including an estimated forty two to seventy two million individuals in europe in the united kingdom , at the extreme edge of the fieldfare 's breeding range , only a handful of pairs breed
