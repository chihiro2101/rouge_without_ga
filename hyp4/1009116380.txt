two renowned archaeologists also worked there as interpreters : dorothy garrod , the first woman to hold an oxbridge chair , and glyn daniel , who went on to gain popular acclaim as the host of the television game show animal , vegetable or mineral ? though the resolution of satellite photographs , which must be taken from distances of hundreds of kilometers , is usually poorer than photographs taken by air , satellites offer the possibility of coverage for much of the earth , including hostile territory , without exposing human pilots to the risk of being shot down the formula for the highest possible resolution of an optical system with a circular aperture is given by the rayleigh criterion : : \sin \theta 1.22 \frac , where θ is the angular resolution , λ is the wavelength of light , and d is the diameter of the lens or mirror were the hubble space telescope , with a 2.4 m telescope , designed for photographing earth , it would be diffraction-limited to resolutions greater than 16 & nbsp ; cm ( 6 & nbsp ; inches ) for green light ( \lambda \approx 550 nm ) at its orbital altitude of 590 & nbsp ; km some other uses of satellite imaging have been to produce detailed 3d maps for use in operations and missile guidance systems , and to monitor normally invisible information such as the growth levels of a country 's crops or the heat given off by certain facilities some of the multi-spectral sensors , such as thermal measurement , are more electro-optical masint than true imint platforms to counter the threat posed by these '' eyes in the sky , '' the united states , ussr/russia , china and india have developed anti-satellite weapon ( either with the use of another 'killer satellite ' , or with some sort of earth- or air-launched missile ) recent high-resolution ( 4–0.5 metre ) private imaging satellites include terrasar-x , ikonos , orbview , quickbird and worldview-1 , allowing any country ( or any business for that matter ) to buy access to satellite images as such , the fidelity of intelligence that may be gleaned from imagery analysis is a traditionally perceived by intelligence professionals as a function of the amount of time an imagery analyst ( ia ) has to exploit a given image or set of imagery as such , the united states army field manual breaks imint analysis into three distinct phases , based upon the amount of time expended in exploiting any given image due to the need to produce near-real time intelligence assessments based upon collected imagery , first phase imagery analysis is rarely compared to collateral intelligence like first phase imagery analysis , second phase imagery analysis is generally catalyzed by a local commander 's priority intelligence requirements , at least in the context of a military operational setting whereas first phase imagery analysis may depend on the exploitation of a relatively small repository of imagery , or even a single image , second phase imagery analysis generally mandates a review of a chronological set of imagery over time , so as to establish a temporal understanding of objects and/or activities of interest third phase imagery analysis is generally conducted in order to satisfy strategic intelligence questions or to otherwise explore existing data in the search of '' discovery intelligence '' third phase imagery analysis hinges on the use of a large repository of historical imagery as well as access to a variety of sources of information third phase imagery analysis incorporates supporting information and intelligence from other intelligence gathering disciplines and is , therefore , generally conducted in support of a multi-source intelligence team lundahl canadian forces intelligence command ( canadian geoint organization ) defence imagery and geospatial organisation ( digo ) ( australian geoint organization ) defence intelligence fusion centre ( british geoint organization ) dino brugioni first images of earth from space gis in geoint geospatial intelligence ( geoint ) national geospatial-intelligence agency ( american geoint organization ) raf intelligence : royal air force intelligence branch remote sensing
