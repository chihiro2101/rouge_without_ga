smpte bars—and several other test cards—include analog black ( a flat waveform at 7.5 ire , or the ntsc setup level ) , full white ( 100 ire ) , and a '' sub-black '' , or '' blacker-than-black '' ( at 0 ire ) , which represents the lowest low-frequency transmission voltage permissible in ntsc broadcasts ( though the negative excursions of the colourburst signal may go below 0 ire ) between the colour bars and proper adjustment of brightness and contrast controls to the limits of perception of the first sub-black bar , an analogue receiver ( or other equipment such as vtrs ) can be adjusted to provide impressive fidelity there are a variety of different test patterns , each testing a specific technical parameter : gradient monotone bars for testing brightness and colour ; a crosshatch pattern for aspect ratio , alignment , focus , and convergence ; and a single-pixel border for overscan and dimensions use of digital interconnect standards , such as ccir 601 and smpte 292m , which operate without the non-linearities and other issues inherent to analogue broadcasting , do not introduce colour shifts or brightness changes ; thus the requirement to detect and compensate for them using this reference signal has been virtually eliminated ) on the other hand , digital test signal generators do include test signals which are intended to stress the digital interface , and many sophisticated generators allow the insertion of jitter , bit errors , and other pathological conditions that can cause a digital interface to fail in developed country such as australia , canada , the united kingdom , and the united states , the financial imperatives of commercial television broadcasting mean that air-time is now typically filled with programmes and commercials ( such as infomercials ) 24 hours a day , and non-commercial broadcasters have to match this for custom-designed video installations , such as led displays in buildings or at live events , some test images are custom-made to fit the specific size and shape of the setup in question rather than physical test cards , which had to be televised using a camera , television stations often used a special purpose camera tube which had the test pattern painted on the inside screen of the tube a history of test card music for copyright reasons much of the music was recorded by light music orchestras in france and germany , though sometimes by british musicians or top international session players using pseudonyms such as the oscar brandenburg orchestra ( an amalgamation of neil richardson , alan moorhouse and johnny pearson ) or the stuttgart studio orchestra the test card circle details of the uk 's trade test transmissions including the history of the bbc and ita test cards , a look at the music used and full details about the trade test colour films shown from the late fifties to 1973 mire.project – street art work about television test patterns tv testbild – very informative , but in german language only testvid test card video sequences – synthetic video test card sequences with moving elements burosch audiovideo technology – advanced hdtv test patterns the test card gallery television test cards , tuning signals , idents and clocks barney wol 's website has details of the development of uk testcards f , j and w 625.uk.com flash files – high quality adobe flash examples of almost all british test cards and station idents ( the test cards are at the bottom of the page and include c , d , f , j , w and etp-1 ) russian test cards nostalgia-tv : television testikuva – test cards in finland , in finnish language only maximum testcardosity test cards ' resources , history and galleries pembers ' ponderings – features detailed technical information of various test cards from the 30-line era to the present day , inclusive of a collection of various european test cards from 1967 to 1976
