while logistics looks at single echelons with the immediate supply and distribution linked up , supply chain looks at multiple echelons/stages , right from procurement of the raw materials to the final distribution of finished goods up to the customer it is based on the basic premise that the supply and distribution activities if integrated with the manufacturing / logistic activities , can result in better profitability for the organization logistics engineers work with complex mathematical models that consider elements such as mean time between failures ( mtbf ) , mean time to failure ( mttf ) , mean time to repair ( mttr ) , failure mode and effects analysis ( fmea ) , statistical distributions , queueing theory , and a host of other considerations if a subsystem is only 50 % reliable , one can concentrate on improving the reliability of that subsystem , design in multiple subsystems in parallel ( 5 in this case would achieve approximately 97 % reliability of that subsystem ) , purchase and store spare subsystems for rapid change out , establish repair capability that would get a failed subsystem back in operation in the required amount of time , and/or choose any combination of those approaches to achieve the optimal cost vs the various fields and topics that logistics engineers are involved with include : customer service : provision of services to customers before , during and after a purchase purchasing : acquiring goods or services to accomplish its goals sourcing : procurement practices , aimed at finding , evaluating and engaging suppliers for acquiring goods and services demand forecasting : the art and science of forecasting customer demand to drive holistic execution of such demand by corporate supply chain and business management facility location : the optimal placement of facilities to minimize transportation costs while considering factors like avoiding placing hazardous materials near housing , and competitors ' facilities layout design inventory control : the activity of checking a shop ’ s stock material handling : short-distance movement within the confines of a building or between a building and a transportation vehicle warehousing distribution system design reliability engineering : sub-discipline of systems engineering that emphasizes dependability in the lifecycle management of a product reverse logistics : the process of moving goods from their typical final destination for the purpose of capturing value , or proper disposal green logistics : attempts to measure and minimize the ecological impact of logistics activities intermodal transport supportability analysis the landed cost is the total cost of purchasing , transporting , warehousing and distributing raw materials , semi-finished and finished goods programs in logistics engineering and management hong kong university of science and technology – bachelor of engineering in logistics management and engineering korea aerospace university - bachelor of science , masters & ph.d programs in logistics széchenyi istván university – masters and ph.d
