although nahco 3 is itself an intermediate product of the solvay process , the heating needed to remove the ammonia that contaminates it decomposes some nahco 3 , making it more economic to react finished na 2 co 3 with co 2 : : na 2 co 3 + co 2 + h 2 o → 2nahco 3 in a related reaction , sodium carbonate is used to make sodium bisulfite ( nahso 3 ) , which is used for the '' sulfite '' method of separating lignin from cellulose sodium carbonate decahydrate ( na 2 co 3 ·10h 2 o ) , also known as washing soda , is the most common hydrate of sodium carbonate containing 10 molecules of water of crystallization in 1861 , the belgium industrial chemist ernest solvay developed a method to make sodium carbonate by first reacting sodium chloride , ammonia , water , and carbon dioxide to generate sodium bicarbonate and ammonium chloride : : nacl + nh 3 + co 2 + h 2 o → nahco 3 + nh 4 cl the resulting sodium bicarbonate was then converted to sodium carbonate by heating it , releasing water and carbon dioxide : :2nahco 3 → na 2 co 3 + h 2 o + co 2 meanwhile , the ammonia was regenerated from the ammonium chloride byproduct by treating it with the lime ( calcium oxide ) left over from carbon dioxide generation : :2nh 4 cl + cao → 2nh 3 + cacl 2 + h 2 o the solvay process recycles its ammonia plant and seaweed sources for soda ash , and also for the related alkali '' potash '' , became increasingly inadequate by the end of the 18th century , and the search for commercially viable routes to synthesizing soda ash from salt and other chemicals intensified sodium carbonate is obtained as three hydrates and as the anhydrous salt : sodium carbonate decahydrate ( natron ) , na 2 co 3 ·10h 2 o , which readily effloresces to form the monohydrate the sodium carbonate concentration in soda ash varied very widely , from 2–3 percent for the seaweed-derived form ( '' kelp '' ) , to 30 percent for the best barilla produced from saltwort plants in spain all three mineralogical forms of sodium carbonate , as well as trona , trisodium hydrogendicarbonate dihydrate , are also known from ultra-alkaline pegmatite , that occur for example in the kola peninsula in russia trona , sodium sesquicarbonate ( na 3 hco 3 co 3 ·2h 2 o ) , is mined in several areas of the us and provides nearly all the domestic consumption of sodium carbonate in dyeing with fiber-reactive dyes , sodium carbonate ( often under a name such as soda ash fixative or soda ash activator ) is used to ensure proper chemical bonding of the dye with cellulose ( plant ) fibers , typically before dyeing ( for tie dyes ) , mixed with the dye ( for dye painting ) , or after dyeing ( for immersion dyeing ) the second step of the solvay process , heating sodium bicarbonate , is used on a small scale by home cooks and in restaurants to make sodium carbonate for culinary purposes ( including pretzels and alkali noodles ) as sodium carbonate is water-soluble and magnesium carbonate and calcium carbonate are insoluble , so it is used to soften water by removing mg 2+ and ca 2+ this solution was boiled dry to create the final product , which was termed '' soda ash '' ; this very old name refers derives from the arabic word soda , in turn applied to salsola soda , one of the many species of seashore plants harvested for production sodium carbonate also erupts from ol doinyo lengai , tanzania 's unique volcano , and it is presumed to have erupted from other volcanoes in the past , but due to these minerals ' instability at the earth 's surface , are likely to be eroded the earlier steam reforming byproduct carbon dioxide was pumped through a saturated solution of brine and ammonia to produce sodium bicarbonate by these reactions : : methane + 2water → carbon dioxide + 4hydrogen :3hydrogen + nitrogen → 2ammonia : ammonia + carbon dioxide + water → ammonium bicarbonate : ammonium bicarbonate + nacl → nh 4 cl + nahco 3 the sodium bicarbonate was collected as a precipitate due to its low solubility and then heated up to approximately or to yield pure sodium carbonate similar to last step of the solvay process by 1900 , 90 % of sodium carbonate was produced by the solvay process , and the last leblanc process plant closed in the early 1920s the method is appealing to such users because sodium bicarbonate is widely sold as baking soda , and the temperatures required to to convert baking soda to sodium carbonate are readily achieved in conventional kitchen ovens first is the carbothermic reaction whereby the coal , a source of carbon , redox the sulfate to sulfide : : na 2 so 4 + 2c & rarr ; na 2 s + 2co 2 the second stage is the reaction to produce sodium carbonate and calcium sulfide : : na 2 s + caco 3 & rarr ; na 2 co 3 + cas this mixture is called black ash several '' halophyte '' ( salt-tolerant ) plant species and seaweed species can be processed to yield an impure form of sodium carbonate , and these sources predominated in europe and elsewhere until the early 19th century some common applications of sodium carbonate ( or washing soda ) include : sodium carbonate ( or washing soda ) is used as a cleansing agent for domestic purposes like washing clothes bottle and window glass ( soda-lime glass ) is made by melting such mixtures of sodium carbonate , calcium carbonate , and silica sand ( silicon dioxide ( sio 2 ) ) this reaction produces sodium sulfate ( salt cake ) and hydrogen chloride : : 2nacl + h 2 so 4 & rarr ; na 2 so 4 + 2hcl the salt cake and crushed limestone ( calcium carbonate ) was reduced by heating with coal the chinese name of hou 's process , lianhe zhijian fa , means '' coupled manufacturing alkali method '' : hou 's process is coupled to the haber process and offers better atom economy by eliminating the production of calcium chloride , since ammonia no longer needs to be regenerated
