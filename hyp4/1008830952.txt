the scope of inventory management concerns the balance between replenishment lead time , carrying costs of inventory , asset management , inventory forecasting , inventory valuation , inventory visibility , future inventory price forecasting , physical inventory , available physical space , quality management , replenishment , returns and defective goods , and demand forecasting it also involves systems and processes that identify inventory requirements , set targets , provide replenishment techniques , report actual and projected inventory status and handle all functions related to the tracking and management of material management of the inventories , with the primary objective of determining/controlling stock levels within the physical distribution system , functions to balance the need for product availability against the need for minimizing stock holding and handling costs there are five basic reasons for keeping an inventory time – the time lags present in the supply chain , from supplier to user at every stage , requires that you maintain certain amounts of inventory to use in this lead time economies of scale – ideal condition of '' one unit at a time at a place where a user needs it , when he needs it '' principle tends to incur lots of costs in terms of logistics appreciation in value – in some situations , some stock gains the required value when it is kept for some time to allow it reach the desired standard for consumption , or for production skus can be any combination of letters and numbers chosen , just as long as the system is consistent and used for all the products in the inventory '' new old stock '' ( sometimes abbreviated nos ) is a term used in business to refer to merchandise being offered for sale that was manufactured long ago but that has never been used buffer/safety stock reorder level cycle stock ( used in batch processes , it is the available inventory , excluding buffer stock ) de-coupling ( buffer stock held between the machines in a single process which serves as a buffer for the next one allowing smooth flow of work instead of waiting the previous or next machine in the same process ) anticipation stock ( building up extra stock for periods of increased demand – e.g ice cream for summer ) pipeline stock ( goods still in transit or in the process of distribution – have left the factory but not arrived at the customer yet ) average daily/weekly usage quantity x lead time in days + safety stock while accountants often discuss inventory in terms of goods for sale , organizations – manufacturers , service providers and not-for-profits – also have inventories ( fixtures , furniture , supplies , etc while the reasons for holding stock were covered earlier , most manufacturing organizations usually divide their '' goods for sale '' inventory into : raw materials – materials and components scheduled for use in making a product a canned food manufacturer 's materials inventory includes the ingredients to form the foods to be canned , empty cans and their lids ( or coils of steel or aluminum for constructing those components ) , labels , and anything else ( solder , glue , etc the firm 's work in process includes those materials from the time of release to the work floor until they become complete and ready for sale to wholesale or retail customers its finished good inventory consists of all the filled and labeled cans of food in its warehouse that it has manufactured and wishes to sell to food distributors ( wholesalers ) , to grocery stores ( retailers ) , and even perhaps to consumers through arrangements like factory stores and outlet centers the partially completed work ( or work in process ) is a measure of inventory built during the work execution of a capital project , “ construction : one type of project production system ” , proceedings of 13th annual conference of the international group for lean construction inventory may not only reflect physical items ( such as materials , parts , partially-finished sub-assemblies ) but also knowledge work-in-process ( such as partially completed engineering designs of components and assemblies to be fabricated ) a '' virtual inventory '' ( also known as a '' bank inventory '' ) enables a group of users to share common parts , especially where their availability at short notice may be critical but they are unlikely to required by more than a few bank members at any one time inventory and logistics operations , cips study materials , profex publishing , 2012 , page 54 virtual inventory also allows distributors and fulfilment houses to ship goods to retailers direct from stock regardless of whether the stock is held in a retail store , stock room or warehouse in such a case , there is no '' excess inventory '' , that is , inventory that would be left over of another product when the first product runs out the technique of inventory proportionality is most appropriate for inventories that remain unseen by the consumer , as opposed to '' keep full '' systems where a retail consumer would like to see full shelves of the product they are buying so as not to think they are buying something old , unwanted or stale ; and differentiated from the '' trigger point '' systems where product is reordered when it hits a certain level ; inventory proportionality is used effectively by just-in-time manufacturing processes and retail applications where the product is hidden from view inventory proportionality is used to balance the inventories of the different grades of motor fuel , each stored in dedicated tanks , in proportion to the sales of each grade it seems that around 1880 relevance lost , johnson and kaplan , harvard business school press , 1987 , p126 there was a change in manufacturing practice from companies with relatively homogeneous lines of products to horizontally integrated companies with unprecedented diversity in processes and products hence , high-level financial inventory has these two basic formulas , which relate to the accounting period : cost of beginning inventory at the start of the period + inventory purchases within the period + cost of production within the period cost of goods available cost of goods available − cost of ending inventory at the end of the period cost of goods sold the benefit of these formulas is that the first absorbs all overheads of production and raw material costs into a value of inventory for reporting : inventory turnover ratio ( also known as inventory turns ) cost of goods sold / average inventory cost of goods sold / ( ( beginning inventory + ending inventory ) / 2 ) and its inverse : average days to sell inventory number of days a year / inventory turnover ratio 365 days a year / inventory turnover ratio this ratio estimates how many times the inventory turns over a year so a factory with two inventory turns has six months stock on hand , which is generally not a good figure ( depending upon the industry ) , whereas a factory that moves from six turns to twelve turns has probably improved effectiveness by 100 % business models , including just in time ( jit ) inventory , vendor managed inventory ( vmi ) and customer managed inventory ( cmi ) , attempt to minimize on-hand inventory and increase inventory turns define inventory to suit their needs within us generally accepted accounting practices ( gaap ) , the rules defined by the financial accounting standards board ( fasb ) ( and others ) and enforced by the u.s a discussion of inventory from standard and theory of constraints-based ( throughput ) cost accounting perspective follows some examples and a discussion of inventory from a financial accounting perspective today , with multistage-process companies , there is much inventory that would once have been finished goods which is now held as 'work in process ' ( wip ) this needs to be valued in the accounts , but the valuation is a management decision since there is no market for the partially finished product in addition to the money tied up by acquiring inventory , inventory also brings associated costs for warehouse space , for utilities , and for insurance to cover staff to handle and protect it from fire and other disasters , obsolescence , shrinkage ( theft and errors ) , and others this effort , known as '' lean production '' will significantly reduce working capital tied up in inventory and reduce manufacturing costs ( see the toyota production system ) it can also help to incentive 's progress and to ensure that reforms are sustainable and effective in the long term , by ensuring that success is appropriately recognized in both the formal and informal reward systems of the organization when a merchant buys goods from inventory , the value of the inventory account is reduced by the cost of goods sold ( cogs ) '' he offers a substitute , called throughput accounting , that uses throughput ( money for goods sold to customers ) in place of output ( goods produced that may sell or may boost inventory ) and considers labor as a fixed rather than as a variable cost he defines inventory simply as everything the organization owns that it plans to sell , including buildings , machinery , and many other things in addition to the categories listed here for example , in the case of supermarkets that a customer frequents on a regular basis , the customer may know exactly what they want and where it is the possibility of sudden falls in commodity prices means that they are usually reluctant to lend more than about 60 % of the value of the inventory at the time of the loan cash conversion cycle consignment stock cost of goods sold economic order quantity inventory investment inventory management software
