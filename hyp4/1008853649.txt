the doctorate ( latin : doctoratus ) appeared in middle ages as a license to teach latin ( licentia docendi ) at a university the doctorate ) was originally reserved to the catholic church , which required the applicant to pass a test , to take an oath of allegiance and to pay a fee in 1213 the right was granted by the pope to the university of paris , where it became a universal license to teach ( licentia ubique docendi ) however , while the licentia continued to hold a higher prestige than the bachelor 's degree ( baccalaureus ) , the latter was ultimately reduced to an intermediate step to the master 's degree ( magister ) and doctorate , both of which now became the accepted teaching qualifications the university as a european institution '' , in : a history of the university in europe , cambridge university press , 1992 , , pp the degrees awarded by european universities – the bachelor 's degree , the licentiate , the master 's degree , and the doctorate – have been adopted in the most diverse societies throughout the world stewart notes a difference in the granting authority ( individual professor for the ijzazah and a corporate entity in the case of the university doctorate ) the term '' philosophy '' does not refer solely to the field or academic discipline of philosophy , but is used in a broader sense in accordance with its original greek meaning , which is '' love of wisdom '' in most of europe , all fields ( history , philosophy , social sciences , mathematics , and natural philosophy/natural sciences ) sooyoung chang , academic genealogy of mathematicians , world scientific , 2010 , p chris park explains that it was not until formal education and degree programs were standardized in the early 19th century that the doctorate of philosophy was reintroduced in germany as a research degree , park , c originally the terms '' master '' and '' doctor '' were synonymous , but over time the doctorate came to be regarded as a higher qualification than the master 's degree the first women to be granted doctorates were juliana morell in 1608 at lyons or maybe avignog ( she '' defended theses '' in 1606 or 1607 , although claims that she received a doctorate in canon law in 1608 have been discredited ) , elena cornaro piscopia in 1678 at the university of padua , laura bassi in 1732 at bologna university , dorothea erxleben in 1754 at halle university and maría isidra de guzmán y de la cerda in 1785 at complutense university , madrid today , a research doctorate ( phd ) or its equivalent ( as defined in the us by the nsf ) is generally a prerequisite for an academia career , although many recipients do not work in academia at kings college ( now columbia university ) after the medical school 's founding in 1767 , although this was not a professional doctorate in the modern american sense as it was awarded for further study after the qualifying bachelor of medicine ( m.b the md , as the standard qualifying degree in medicine , gave that profession the ability ( through the american medical association , established in 1847 for this purpose ) to set and raise standards for entry into professional practice the modern research degree , in the shape of the german-style phd , was first awarded in the us in 1861 , at yale university this differed from the md in that the latter was a vocational '' professional degree '' that trained students to apply or practice knowledge , rather than generate it , similar to other students in vocational schools or institutes in the uk , research doctorates initially took the form of higher doctorates in science and letters , first introduced at durham university in 1882 the phd spread to the uk from the us via canada , and was instituted at all british universities from 1917 , with the first ( titled a dphil ) being awarded at the university of oxford however it took a long time to be accepted , not replacing the bachelor of laws ( llb ) until the 1960s , by which time the llb was generally taken as a graduate degree notably , the curriculum for the jd and llb were identical , with the degree being renamed as a doctorate , and it ( like the md ) was not equivalent to the phd , raising criticism that it was '' not a 'true doctorate when professional doctorates were established in the uk in the late 1980s and early 1990s , they did not follow the us model but were instead set up as research degrees at the same level as phds but with some taught components and a professional focus for the research work the habilitation is still used for academic recruitment purposes in many countries within the eu , and involves either a new long thesis ( a second book ) or a portfolio of research publications research doctorates are awarded in recognition of academic research that is publishable , at least in principle , in a peer review academic journal or dba ) , the uk doctor of management ( dman ) , various doctorates in engineering , such as the us doctor of engineering ( d.eng the uk doctor of medicine ( md or md ( res ) ) and doctor of dental surgery ( dds ) are research doctorates criteria for research doctorates vary , but typically require completion of a substantial body of original research , which may be presented as a single thesis or dissertation , or as a portfolio of shorter project reports ( thesis by publication ) the submitted dissertation is assessed by a committee of examiners , and is then typically defended by the candidate during an oral examination ( viva in the uk and india ) by the committee it used to be attained after completion of the majority of courses of the academic study ( usually after completion of course requirements of the third year in the program ) , after which the student was allowed to begin work on their doctorandus thesis the old candidate 's degree was revived to become the bachelor 's degree and the doctorandus ' ( mr and ir degree ) were replaced by master 's degrees , at harvard is taught in ph.d.-courses ( for instance advanced quantum mechanics or general relativity in a dutch course for the master 's degree in theoretical physics ) the most common way to conduct doctoral studies is to work as promovendus/assistant in opleiding ( aio ) /onderzoeker in opleiding ( oio ) ( research assistant with additional courses and supervision ) , perform extensive research and write a dissertation consisting of published articles ( over a period of four or more years , averaging about 5.5 to 6 ) the degree is awarded in a formal , public , defense session , in which the thesis is defended against critical questions of the '' opposition '' ( the review committee ) three dutch universities of technology ( eindhoven university of technology , delft university of technology , and university of twente ) also award a ( lower ranked ) professional doctorate in engineering ( pdeng ) the licentiaat ( licensee ) title was in use for a regular graduate until the bologna reform changed the licentiaat degree to the master 's degree ( the bologna reform abolished the two-year kandidaat degree and introduced a three-year academic bachelor 's degree instead ) sciences '' ( the literal translation means '' candidate of sciences '' , ) ( for instance , kandidat of medical sciences , of chemical sciences , of philological sciences etc ) degree and requires at least ( and typically more than ) three , four or five years of post-graduate research which is finished by defence of dissertation or rarely—thesis additionally , a seeker of the degree has to pass three examinations ( a so-called '' kandidate 's minimum '' ) : in his/her special field , in a foreign language , and in the history and philosophy of science , which originates from the course of communist ideology named similar in soviet times ) the second stage , doktor nauk , '' doctor of sciences '' , requires many years of research experience , and writing of a second dissertation the degrees of kandidat and doktor of sciences are only awarded by the special governmental agency ( higher attestation commission ) ; only the university or scientific institute where the thesis was defended can recommend the award of this degree to candidates in the russian empire the academic degree '' doctor of the sciences '' ( doktor nauk ) marked the highest academic degree that can be achieved by an examination ( the '' doctor nauk '' degree was introduced in russia in 1819 , abolished in 1917 , and revived in the ussr in 1934 a lower degree , '' candidate of sciences candidate doctor of the sciences '' ( kandidat nauk ; first introduced in the ussr on january 13 , 1934 , by a decision of the sovnarkom ) , is , roughly , the russian equivalent to the research doctorate in other countries four marks used to be granted : unsatisfactory ( suspenso ) , pass ( aprobado ) , remarkable ( notable ) , '' cum laude '' ( sobresaliente ) , and '' summa cum laude '' ( sobresaliente cum laude ) this was soon followed by other universities , including the university of cambridge establishing its scd in the same year , the university of london transforming its dsc from an advanced study course to a research degree in 1885 , and the university of oxford establishing its doctor of letters ( dlitt ) in 1900 the earliest professional doctorates were in the social sciences , including the doctor of business administration ( dba ) , doctor of education ( edd ) and doctor of clinical psychology ( dclinpsy ) today , except for those awarded honoris causa ( honorary degrees ) , all doctorates granted by british universities are research doctorates , in that their main ( and in many cases only ) component is the submission of an extensive and substantial thesis or portfolio of original research , examined by an expert panel appointed by the university uk doctorates are categorised as : ; junior doctorates : subject specialist doctorates – normally phd/dphil ; the most common form of doctorate : integrated subject specialist doctorates – integrated phds including teaching at master 's level : doctorates by publication – phd by published works ; only awarded infrequently : professional and practice-based ( or practitioner ) doctorates – e.g dd , lld , dsc , dlitt ; higher level than junior doctorates , usually awarded either for a substantial body of work over an extended period or as honorary degrees the quality assurance agency states in the framework for higher education qualifications of uk degree-awarding bodies ( which covers junior doctorates but not higher doctorates ) that : in the uk , the ( junior ) doctorate is a qualification awarded at fheq level 8/level 12 of the fqheis on the national qualifications frameworks the higher doctorates are stated to be '' a higher level of award '' , which is not covered by the qualifications frameworks however , the assessment of the phd remains based on the production of a thesis or equivalent and its defence at a oral exam oral examination , normally held in front of at least two examiners , one internal and one external these integrate teaching at master 's level during the first one or two years of the degree , either alongside research or as a preliminary to starting research in the latest version ( 2016 ) , issued together with cancer research uk , the wellcome trust and the british heart foundation , these include the provision of careers advice , in-depth advanced training in the subject area , provision of transferable skills , training in experimental design and statistics , training in good research conduct , and training for compliance with legal , ethical and professional frameworks typically the candidate submits a collection of previously published , peer-refereed work , which is reviewed by a committee of internal and external academics who decide whether the candidate deserves the doctorate while the habilitation formally determines whether an academic is suitably qualified to be a university professor , the higher doctorate does not qualify the holder for a position but rather recognises their contribution to research higher doctorates were defined by the uk council for graduate education ( ukcge ) in 2013 as : in terms of number of institutions offering the awards , the most common doctorates of this type in ukcge surveys carried out in 2008 and 2013 were the doctor of science ( dsc ) , doctor of letters ( dlitt ) , doctor of law ( lld ) , doctor of music ( dmus ) and doctor of divinity ( dd ) ; in the 2008 survey the doctor of technology ( dtech ) tied with the dd in terms of number of higher doctorates awarded ( not including honorary doctorates ) the dsc was most popular , but the number of awards was very low : the responding institutions had averaged an award of at most one earned higher doctorate per year over the period 2003–2013 however , some universities differentiate between honorary and substantive doctorates , using the degree of doctor of the university ( d.univ multiple professional degrees use the term '' doctor '' in their title , such as juris doctor and doctor of medicine , but these degrees do not always contain an independent research component or always require a dissertation and should not be confused with ph.d./d.phil./ed.d./d.ed department of education listed over 20 '' frequently '' awarded research doctorate titles identified by the national science foundation ( nsf ) in a 2008 document as representing degrees equivalent in research content to the ph.d many fields offer professional doctorates ( or professional master 's ) such as pharmacy , medicine , public health , dentistry , occupational therapy , optometry , psychology , speech-language pathology , physical therapy , occupational therapy , health science , advanced practice registered nurse , chiropractic , naturopathic medicine , law , architecture , education , teaching , trade , management , and others that require such degrees for professional practice or licensure some of these degrees are also termed '' first professional degrees , '' since they are the first field-specific master 's or doctoral degrees
