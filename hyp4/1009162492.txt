therefore , no such media deterioration takes place , and the cd will , with proper care , sound exactly the same every time it is played ( discounting aging of the player and cd itself ) ; however , this is a benefit of the optical system , not of digital recording , and the laserdisc format enjoys the same non-contact benefit with analog optical signals while the words analog audio usually imply that the sound is described using a continuous time/continuous amplitudes approach in both the media and the reproduction/recording systems , and the words digital audio imply a discrete time/discrete amplitudes approach , there are methods of encoding audio that fall somewhere between the two , e.g other sources of jitter within digital electronic circuits are data-induced jitter , where one part of the digital stream affects a subsequent part as it flows through the system , and power supply induced jitter , where noise from the power supply causes irregularities in the timing of signals in the circuits it powers typically , a 16-bit analog-to-digital converter may have a dynamic range of between 90 and 95 & nbsp ; db , whereas the signal-to-noise ratio ( roughly the equivalent of dynamic range , noting the absence of quantization noise but presence of tape hiss ) of a professional reel-to-reel ¼-inch tape recorder would be between 60 and 70 & nbsp ; db at the recorder 's rated output this form of distortion , sometimes called granular or quantization distortion , has been pointed to as a fault of some digital systems and recordings particularly some early digital recordings , where the digital release was said to be inferior to the analog version digital systems require that all high frequency signal content above the nyquist frequency must be removed prior to sampling , which , if not done , will result in these ultrasound frequencies '' folding over '' into frequencies which are in the audible range , producing a kind of distortion called aliasing with digital systems , the quality of reproduction depends on the analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion steps , and does not depend on the quality of the recording medium , provided it is adequate to retain the digital values without error dither algorithms also commonly have an option to employ some kind of noise shaping , which pushes the frequency of much of the dither noise to areas that are less audible to human ears , lowering the level of the noise floor apparent to the listener the core of the claim that pcm recordings ( the only digital recording technique available at the time ) created a stress reaction rested on using the pseudoscientific technique of applied kinesiology , for example by dr diamond at an aes 66th convention ( 1980 ) presentation with the same title stuart stresses that with the correct dither , the resolution of a digital system is theoretically infinite , and that it is possible , for example , to resolve sounds at −110 & nbsp ; db ( below digital full-scale ) in a well-designed 16 bit channel wow ( recording ) are a change in frequency of an analog device and are the result of mechanical imperfections , with wow being a slower rate form of flutter dunn ( 1998 ) examined the performance of digital converters to see if these differences in performance could be explained by the band-limiting filters used in converters and looking for the artifacts they introduce digital and analog differ in both the methods of transfer and storage , as well as the behavior exhibited by the systems due to these methods numbers on computers represent a finite set of discrete values , which means that if an analog signal is digitally sampled using native methods ( without dither ) , the amplitude of the audio signal will simply be rounded to the nearest representation magnetic tapes , both analog and digital , wear from friction between the tape and the heads , guides , and other parts of the tape transport as the tape slides over them after initial recording , it is common for the audio signal to be altered in some way , such as with the use of compression , equalization , delays and reverb with analog , this comes in the form of outboard gear , and with digital , the same is typically accomplished with plug-ins in a digital audio workstation ( daw ) there are some differences in the behaviour of analog and digital systems when high level signals are present , where there is the possibility that such signals could push the system into overload the low frequency response of vinyl records is restricted by rumble noise ( described above ) , as well as the physical and electrical characteristics of the entire pickup arm and transducer assembly a signal is recorded digitally by an analog-to-digital converter , which measures the amplitude of an analog signal at regular intervals specified by the sampling rate , and then stores these sampled numbers in computer hardware spiral groove depth , tape magnetic field strength ) without noticeable quantization or aliasing , there are analog non-linear systems that exhibit effects similar to those encountered on digital ones , such as aliasing and '' hard '' dynamic floors ( e.g although those '' hybrid '' techniques are usually more common in telecommunications systems than in consumer audio , their existence alone blurs the distinctive line between certain digital and analog systems , at least for what regards some of their alleged advantages or disadvantages optimal use of dither has the effect of making quantization error independent of the signal , and allows signal information to be retained below the least significant bit of the digital system however , '' if the quantisation is performed using the right dither , then the only consequence of the digitisation is effectively the addition of a white , uncorrelated , benign , random noise floor although this effect alters the signal in a way other than a strict change in frequency response , this coloration can sometimes have a positive effect on the perception of the sound of the audio signal in contrast , digital pcm recorders show non-benign behaviour in overload ; samples that exceed the peak quantization level are simply truncated , clipping the waveform squarely , which introduces distortion in the form of large quantities of higher-frequency harmonics these results suggest that the main benefit to using higher sample rates is that it pushes consequential phase distortion from the band-limiting filters out of the audible range and that , under ideal conditions , higher sample rates may not be necessary the dynamic range of an audio system is a measure of the difference between the smallest and largest amplitude values that can be represented in a medium consequently , the accuracy to which the original signal can be preserved is instead limited by the intrinsic noise-floor and maximum signal level of the media and the playback equipment rumble is a form of noise characteristic caused by imperfections in the bearings of turntables , the platter tends to have a slight amount of motion besides the desired rotation—the turntable surface also moves up-and-down and side-to-side slightly for electronic audio signals , sources of noise include mechanical , electrical and thermal noise in the recording and playback cycle wow and flutter can also be present in the recording , as a result of the imperfect operation of the recorder this process is called quantization , and these small errors in the measurements are manifested aurally as low level noise or distortion the accuracy of a digital system is dependent on the sampled amplitude values , but it is also dependent on the temporal regularity of these values the bandwidth provided by the 44,100 hz sampling frequency used by the red book ( cd standard ) is sufficiently wide to cover the entire human hearing range , which roughly extends from 20 & nbsp ; hz to 20 & nbsp ; khz analog modeling carries some benefits over their analog counterparts , such as the ability to remove noise from the algorithms and modifications to make the parameters more flexible mathematically , this can be expressed by means of the signal to noise ratio ( snr or s/n ratio ) critics of double-blind tests see them as not allowing the listener to feel fully relaxed when evaluating the system component , and can therefore not judge differences between different components as well as in sighted ( non-blind ) tests '' in blind listening tests conducted by bob katz in 1996 , recounted in his book mastering audio : the art and the science , subjects using the same high-sample-rate reproduction equipment could not discern any audible difference between program material identically filtered to remove frequencies above 20 & nbsp ; khz versus 40 & nbsp ; khz this is called the resolution , and is usually referred to as the bit depth in the context of pcm audio '' the range of possible values that can be represented numerically by a sample is determined by the number of binary digits used those who favour the digital format point to the results of blind tests , which demonstrate the high performance possible with digital recorders the digital filter can be made to have a near-ideal transfer function , with low in-band ripple , and no aging or thermal drift at any point in time , the amplitude of the original analog signal is represented by the relative preponderance of 1 's over 0 's in the data stream plug-in parameters can be stored on the computer , whereas parameter details on an analog unit must be written down or otherwise recorded if the unit needs to be reused this test is popular with hi-fi reviewers , where the component is used for a length of time by the reviewer who then will describe the performance in subjective terms with many recordings , high level distortions at signal peaks may be audibly masked by the original signal , thus large amounts of distortion may be acceptable at peak signal levels this states that a sampled signal can be reproduced exactly as long as it is sampled at a frequency greater than twice the bandwidth of the signal , the nyquist frequency there are many benefits to using digital recording over analog recording because “ numbers are more easily manipulated than are grooves on a record or magnetized particles on a tape ”
