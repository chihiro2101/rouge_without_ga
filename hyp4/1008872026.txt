before fermentation , raw meat ( usually pork or beef depending on the type of salami that is produced ) is ground ( usually coarsely ) and mixed with other ingredients such as salt , sugar , spices , pepper and yeast , and , if the particular salami variety requires it , lactic acid bacterial starter culture the italian tradition of cured meats includes several styles , and the word salame soon specifically meant only the most popular kind—a salted and spiced meat , ground and extruded into an elongated , thin casing ( usually cleaned animal intestine ) , then left to undergo natural fermentation and drying for days , months , or even years direct acidification of meat was found to be inappropriate for salami production , since it causes protein denaturation and an uneven coagulation , thereby causing an undesirable texture in the salami also , environmental conditions dictate what food processes are used , as seen in the mediterranean and southern europe , where '' meat products are dried to lower water activity ( aw ) values , taking advantage of the long dry and sunny days , while in northern europe , fermented sausages require smoking for further preservation szegedi téliszalámi , a hungarian winter salami , is made of raw pork , bacon , salt , spices , sugars , and sodium nitrite naples-type salami is also a popular southern italian dry fermented sausage made of coarsely minced pork meat in germany , westphalian salami is made with fast technology from pork meat , pepper , garlic , and sometimes mustard seeds , and is smoked , firm , sliceable product with a distinct fermentation/sour flavor to achieve the flavor and texture that salami possesses , fermentation , which can also be referred to as a slow acidification process promoting a series of chemical reactions in the meat , has to take place salami will remain stable for long periods of time , as it has a low water activity and contains preservatives , colourings , flavourings , antioxidants and acidifying cultures salt , acidity , nitrate/nitrite levels , and dryness of the fully cured salami combine to make the uncooked meat safe to consume other popular dry salamis in italy are mainly made from a combination of pork and small bits of beef , seasoned with garlic ; pepperoni is also made of pork and beef , and is usually smoked ; and chorizo is highly spiced and smoked the main cause of flavour deterioration in dry-cured sausage is rancidity , though the possible formation of other off-flavours , such as mouldy , acid , putrid or pungent traits , may contribute to the decreased quality when smoke is applied to salami , it also affects the taste , smell , appearance , and texture for a more modern controlled fermentation , makers hang the salami in warm , humid conditions for 1–3 days to encourage the fermenting bacteria to grow , then hang it in a cool , humid environment to slowly dry it is a singular or plural word in english for cured meats of a european ( particularly italian ) style salami varieties include : cacciatore ( cacciatora , cacciatorini ) '' hunter '' salami , italy chorizo , also spicy iberian variant ciauscolo , typical of marche fegatelli felino , province of parma finocchiona , typical of southern tuscany genovese kulen spicy salami characteristic for slavonia , vojvodina , and parts of baranya lardo napoletano , napoli milanese , milano 'nduja pepperoni salado , local salami of corfu sujuk , turkish salami saucisson sec ( french '' dry sausage '' ) sibiu salami ( a romanian variety of salami ) soppressata , typical of calabria spegepølse ( danish , means salted and dried sausage ) vysočina winter salami ( hungarian téliszalámi ) many old world salami are named after their region or country of origin—such as arles , genoa , hungary , and milano salami '' in europe , the main countries that produce salami are france , germany , hungary , italy , and spain , which make several hundred million kilograms per year in northeast italy , traditional dry fermented salami sausages made of fresh pork display unique organoleptic sensory profiles characterized by accented acidity , slight sourness , and elastic semi hard consistency fermented pork back fat that is used to make salami has very high saturated fatty acid and cholesterol content , which are popularly believed to increase the risk of heart disease and pancreatitis despite the fact that these bacteria can help maintain a longer shelf life for meat products and even retard the growth of pathogens , there are a few studies that argue some starter cultures may be related to the production of enterotoxins or biogenic amines that can be harmful to the human body : ecology of lactic acid bacteria and coagulase negative cocci in fermented dry sausages manufactured in italy and other mediterranean countries : an overview , in : international food research journal 23 ( 2 ) : 429-445 ( 2016 ) or micrococcus len poli : making salami at home , sonoma mountain sausage , 4 september 2016 are most commonly used in salami production this type of traditional sausage , which undergoes an adventitious fermentation , is of superior quality compared to those inoculated with starters and made in industrial scale typical additional ingredients include : garlic minced fat salt spices , usually white pepper various herbs vinegar wine the maker usually ferments the raw meat mixture for a day , then stuffs it into either an edible natural or inedible cellulose casing , and hangs it up to cure hungarian-type salami is a specialty in salami production , because it is first slightly smoked and mold-ripened afterward
