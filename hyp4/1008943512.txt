maxims of equity are not a rigid set of rules , but are , rather , general principles which can be derived from in specific cases see j martin , hanbury and martin 's modern equity ( 19th edn sweet and maxwell 2012 ) 1-024 snell 's equity , an english treatise , takes the view that the '' maxims do not cover the whole ground , and moreover they overlap , one maxim contains by implication what belongs to another sometimes phrased as '' equity regards as done what should have been done '' , this maxim means that when individuals are required , by their agreements or by law , to perform some act of legal significance , equity will regard that act as having been done as it ought to have been done , even before it has actually happened the consequences of this maxim , and of equitable conversion , are significant in their bearing on the risk of loss in transactions due to his equitable interest in the outcome of the transaction , the buyer who suffers a breach may be entitled to the equitable remedy of specific performance ( although not always , see below ) if he is successful in seeking a remedy at law , he is entitled to the value of the property at the time of breach regardless of whether it has appreciated or depreciated the fact that the buyer may be forced to suffer a depreciation in the value of the property means that he bears the risk of loss if , for example , the improvements on the property he bought burn down while he is still in escrow it was clear that if the notice had been received by the policyholder , he or his wife would have taken steps to ensure the policy continued in force , because the policyholder was terminally ill at the time and the coverage provided by the policy was something his wife was plainly going to require in the foreseeable future the maxim is necessarily subordinate to positive principles and can not be applied either to subvert established rules of law or to give the courts a jurisdiction hitherto unknown , and it is only in a general not in a literal sense that the maxim has force this maxim flows from the fundamental notion of equality or impartiality due to the conception of equity and is the source of many equitable doctrines the applicant to a court of equity is just as much subject to the power of that court as the defendant this differs from a statute of limitations , in that a delay is particularized to individual situations , rather than a general prescribed legal amount of time in england , there was a distinction drawn between the jurisdiction of the law courts and that of the chancery court their coercive power arose from the ability , on authority of the crown , to hold a violator in contempt , and take away his freedom ( or money ) until he purged himself of his contumacious behavior rather , it means that they came to require that the applicant assert a right of some significant substance as opposed to a claim for relief based on an injury to mere emotional or dignitary interests at common law , a mortgage was a conveyance of the property , with a condition subsequent , that if the grantor paid the secured indebtedness to the grantee on or before a date certain ( the '' law '' day ) then the condition subsequent would be void , otherwise to remain in full force and effect as was inevitable , debtors would be unable to pay on the law day , and if they tendered the debt after the time had passed , the creditor owed no duty to give the land back so then the debtor would run to the court of equity , plead that there was an unconscionable forfeiture about to occur , and beg the court to grant an equitable decree requiring the lender to surrender the property upon payment of the secured debt with interest to date impaired , that is , until lawyers concocted the bill of foreclosure , whereby a mortgagee could request a decree that unless the mortgagor paid the debt by a date certain ( and after the law date set in the mortgage ) , the mortgagor would thereafter be barred and foreclosed of all right , title and equity of redemption in and to the mortgaged premises to complete the circle , one needs to understand that when a mortgagor fails to pay an installment when due , and the mortgagee accelerates the mortgage , requiring immediate repayment of the entire mortgage indebtedness , the mortgagor does not have a right to pay the past-due installment ( s ) and have the mortgage reinstated , 254 ny 1 ( 1930 ) the new york court of appeals observed that in such a case , there was no forfeiture , only the operation of a clause fair on its face , to which the mortgagor had freely assented in the latter 20th century , new york 's lower courts eroded the graf doctrine to such a degree that it appears that it is no longer the law , and that a court of conscience has the power to mandate that a default be excused if it is equitable to do so of course , now that the pendulum is swinging in the opposite direction , we can expect courts to explain where the limits on the newly expanded equity of redemption lie.and it is probably not a coincidence that the cases that have eroded graf v as the builders were in serious financial difficulties ( as the rees knew ) , they reluctantly accepted the £300 '' in completion of the account '' when a court of equity is presented with a good claim to equitable relief , and it is clear that the plaintiff also sustained monetary damages , the court of equity has jurisdiction to render legal relief , e.g thus , '' where a court of equity has all the parties before it , it will adjudicate upon all of the rights of the parties connected with the subject matter of the action , so as to avoid a multiplicity of suits this maxim , also expressed as aequitas sequitur legem , means more fully that '' equity will not allow a remedy that is contrary to law story states '' where a rule , either of the common or the statute law is direct , and governs the case with all its circumstances , or the particular point , a court of equity is as much bound by it as a court of law , and can as little justify a departure from it in modern-day england and wales , this maxim no longer applies ; as per section 49 ( 1 ) of the senior courts act 1981 , the law follows equity instead : : subject to the provisions of this or any other act , every court exercising jurisdiction in england or wales in any civil cause or matter shall continue to administer law and equity on the basis that , wherever there is any conflict or variance between the rules of equity and the rules of the common law with reference to the same matter , the rules of equity shall prevail for example , if a person a expects from past conversations and friendship to receive property under any will of person b , but person b dies before writing this into their will , person a , having not made any contribution to person b , will not be able to seek equity 's aid restitution developed as a series of writs called special assumpsit , which were later additions in the courts of law , and were more flexible tools of recovery , based on equity if a donor has failed to fulfil all the required legal formalities to effect a transfer , meaning the gift is an imperfect gift , equity will not act to provide assistance to the donee however , there are certain relaxations to the maxim , including the rule of re rose of where the donor has “ done all in his power to divest himself of and to transfer ” the property , re rose 1952 ch 499 , 515 and the more recent but controversial use of unconscionability as a method of dispensing a formality requirement the significance of this maxim is that applicants to the chancellors often did so because of the formal pleading of the law courts , and the lack of flexibility they offered to litigants law courts and legislature , as lawmakers , through the limits of the substantive law they had created , thus inculcated a certain status quo that affected private conduct , and private ordering of disputes if the law firmly denied a cause of action or suggested equities between the parties were as a matter of policy equal , equity would provide no relief ; if the law did provide relief , then the applicant would be obligated to bring a legal , rather than equitable action
