although growth may initially be exponential , the modelled phenomena will eventually enter a region in which previously ignored negative feedback factors become significant ( leading to a logistic growth model ) or other underlying assumptions of the exponential growth model , such as continuity or instantaneous feedback , break down if the probability of neutron absorption exceeds the probability of neutron escape ( a function of the shape and mass of the uranium ) , the production rate of neutrons and induced uranium fissions increases exponentially , in an uncontrolled reaction this kind of algorithm typically becomes unusable at very small problem sizes , often between 30 and 100 items ( most computer algorithms need to be able to solve much larger problems , up to tens of thousands or even millions of items in reasonable times , something that would be physically impossible with an exponential algorithm ) in between exponential and hyperbolic growth lie more classes of growth behavior , like the hyperoperations beginning at tetration , and a ( n , n ) , the diagonal of the ackermann function internet contents , such as internet memes or videos , can spread in an exponential manner , often said to '' go viral '' as an analogy to the spread of viruses so for an algorithm of time complexity 2 x , if a problem of size requires 10 seconds to complete , and a problem of size requires 20 seconds , then a problem of size will require 40 seconds the king asked what he would like in return for his gift and the courtier surprised the king by asking for one grain of rice on the first square , two grains on the second , four grains on the third , etc all went well at first , but the requirement for 2 nâˆ’1 grains on the nth square demanded over a million grains on the 21st square , more than a million million trillion ) on the 41st and there simply was not enough rice in the whole world for the final squares with media such as social networks , one person can forward the same content to many people simultaneously , who then spread it to even more people , and so on , causing rapid spread for example , the video gangnam style was uploaded to youtube on 15 july 2012 , reaching hundreds of thousands of viewers on the first day , millions on the twentieth day , and was cumulatively viewed by hundreds of millions in less than two months typically the first organism splits into two daughter organisms , who then each split to form four , who split to form eight , and so on if a slow processor can solve problems of size x in time t , then a processor twice as fast could only solve problems of size x + constant in the same time t '' due to the exponential rate of increase , at any point in the chain reaction 99 % of the energy will have been released in the last 4.6 generations accelerating change albert allen bartlett arthrobacter asymptotic notation bacterial growth bounded growth cell growth exponential algorithm expspace exptime hausdorff dimension hyperbolic growth information explosion law of accelerating returns list of exponential topics logarithmic growth logistic function malthusian growth model menger sponge moore 's law quadratic growth stein 's law day after day , the plant 's growth is small , so it is decided that it wo n't be a concern until it covers half of the pond
