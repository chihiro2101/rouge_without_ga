a 2017 study found that the just war tradition can be traced as far back as to ancient egypt , '' demonstrating that just war thought developed beyond the boundaries of europe and existed many centuries earlier than the advent of christianity or even the emergence of greco-roman doctrine a long discussion then ensues between the siblings , establishing criteria like proportionality ( chariots can not attack cavalry , only other chariots ; no attacking people in distress ) , just means ( no poisoned or barbed arrows ) , just cause ( no attacking out of rage ) , and fair treatment of captives and the wounded at the beginning of the war , there is the discussion of '' just conduct '' appropriate to the context of war though some core tenets in the sikh religion are understood to emphasise peace and nonviolence , especially before the 1606 execution of guru arjan by mughal emperor jahangir , military force may be justified if all peaceful means to settle a conflict have been exhausted , thus resulting in a dharamyudh livy 1.32 ; 31.8.3 ; 36.3.9 more broadly , conventions of war and treaty-making were part of the ius gentium , the '' law of nations '' , the customary moral obligations regarded as innate and universal to human beings christian theory of the just war begins with augustine of hippo christians and war : augustine of hippo and the '' just war theory '' and thomas aquinas christians and war : thomas aquinas refines the '' just war '' theory the just war theory , with some amendments , is still used by christians today as a guide to whether or not a war can be justified defense of one 's self or others could be a necessity , especially when authorized by a legitimate authority : they who have waged war in obedience to the divine command , or in conformity with his laws , have represented in their persons the public justice or the wisdom of government , and in this capacity have put to death wicked men ; such persons have by no means violated the commandment , '' thou shalt not kill '' while not breaking down the conditions necessary for war to be just , augustine nonetheless originated the very phrase itself in his work the city of god : but , say they , the wise man will wage just wars as if he would not all the rather lament the necessity of just wars , if he remembers that he is a man ; for if they were not just he would not wage them , and would therefore be delivered from all wars mark mattox writes that , for the individual christian under the rule of a government engaged in an immoral war , augustine admonished that christians , '' by divine edict , have no choice but to subject themselves to their political masters and should seek to ensure that they execute their war-fighting duty as justly as possible aquinas argued that it was only in the pursuit of justice , that the good intention of a moral act could justify negative consequences , including the killing of the innocent during a war war is not legitimate or illegitimate simply based on its original motivation : it must comply with a series of additional requirements : it is necessary that the response be commensurate with the evil ; use of more violence than is strictly necessary would constitute an unjust war at the british government 's request randall davidson , archbishop of canterbury , took the lead in collaborating with a large number of other religious leaders , including some with whom he had differed in the past , to write a rebuttal of the germans ' contentions the just war doctrine of the catholic church found in the 1992 catechism of the catholic church , in paragraph 2309 , lists four strict conditions for '' legitimate defense by military force '' : the damage inflicted by the aggressor on the nation or community of nations must be lasting , grave , and certain ; all other means of putting an end to it must have been shown to be impractical or ineffective ; there must be serious prospects of success ; the use of arms must not produce evils and disorders graver than the evil to be eliminated ( the power of modern means of destruction weighs very heavily in evaluating this condition ) the compendium of the social doctrine of the church elaborates on the just war doctrine in paragraphs 500 to 501 : : if this responsibility justifies the possession of sufficient means to exercise this right to defense , states still have the obligation to do everything possible '' to ensure that the conditions of peace exist , not only within their own territory but throughout the world '' international legitimacy for the use of armed force , on the basis of rigorous assessment and with well-founded motivations , can only be given by the decision of a competent body that identifies specific situations as threats to peace and authorizes an intrusion into the sphere of autonomy usually reserved to a state the document offers criteria of distinguishing between an aggressive war , which is unacceptable , and a justified war , attributing the highest moral and sacred value of military acts of bravery to a true believer who participates in a “ justified ” war additionally , the document considers the just war criteria as developed in western christianity eligible for russian orthodoxy , so the “ justified war ” idea in western theology is applicable to the russian orthodox church too cardinal cajetan , the jurist francisco de vitoria , the two jesuit priests luis de molina and francisco suárez , as well as the humanist hugo grotius and the lawyer luigi taparelli were most influential in the formation of a just war tradition if by pacifism is meant the teaching that the use of force is never justifiable , then , however well meant , it is mistaken , and it is hurtful to the life of our country '' armed conflicts such as the spanish civil war , world war ii and the cold war were , as a matter of course , judged according to the norms that aquinas ' just war theory had established by philosophers such as jacques maritain , elizabeth anscombe and john finnis just war theories are attempts '' to distinguish between justifiable and unjustifiable uses of organized armed forces '' ; they attempt '' to conceive of how the use of arms might be restrained , made more humane , and ultimately directed towards the aim of establishing lasting peace and justice '' although the criticism can be made that the application of just war theory is relativism , one of the fundamental bases of the tradition is the ethic of reciprocity , particularly when it comes to in bello considerations of deportment during battle if one set of combatants promise to treat their enemies with a modicum of restraint and respect , then the hope is that other sets of combatants will do similarly in reciprocation ( a concept not unrelated to the considerations of game theory ) the just war tradition addresses the morality of the use of force in two parts : when it is right to resort to armed force ( the concern of jus ad bellum ) and what is acceptable in using such force ( the concern of jus in bello ) in more recent years , a third category—jus post bellum—has been added , which governs the justice of war termination and peace agreements , as well as the prosecution of war criminals in simple terms : '' to the russian workers has fallen the honor and the good fortune of being the first to start the revolution—the great and only legitimate and just war , the war of the oppressed against the oppressors in that manner , lenin shunned the more common interpretation of a defensive war as a just one—often summarized as '' who fired the first shot ? '' —precisely because it did n't take in consideration the class factor which side initiated aggressions or had a grievance or any other commonly considered factor of jus ad bellum mattered not at all , he claimed ; if one side was being oppressed by the other , the war against the oppressor would always be , by definition , a defensive war anyway any war lacking this duality of oppressed and oppressor was , in contradistinction , always a reactionary , unjust war , in which the oppressed effectively fight in order to protect their own oppressors : '' but picture to yourselves a slave-owner who owned 100 slaves warring against a slave-owner who owned 200 slaves for a more '' just '' distribution of slaves clearly , the application of the term '' defensive '' war , or war '' for the defense of the fatherland '' in such a case would be historically false , and in practice would be sheer deception of the common people , of philistines , of ignorant people , by the astute slaveowners the just war theory prevailing for most of the last two centuries—that violence is an evil that can , in certain situations , be condoned as the lesser of evils—is relatively young although it has inherited some elements ( the criteria of legitimate authority , just cause , right intention ) from the older war theory that first evolved around ad 400 , it has rejected two premises that underpinned all medieval just wars , including crusades : first , that violence could be employed on behalf of christ 's intentions for mankind and could even be directly authorized by him ; and second , that it was a morally neutral force that drew whatever ethical coloring it had from the intentions of the perpetrators just war theory has two sets of criteria , the first establishing jus ad bellum ( the right to go to war ) , and the second establishing jus in bello ( right conduct within war ) ; just cause : the reason for going to war needs to be just and can not , therefore , be solely for recapturing things taken or punishing people who have done wrong ; innocent life must be in imminent danger and intervention must be to protect life '' ; comparative justice : while there may be rights and wrongs on all sides of a conflict , to overcome the presumption against the use of force , the injustice suffered by one party must significantly outweigh that suffered by the other ; right intention : force may be used only in a truly just cause and solely for that purpose—correcting a suffered wrong is considered a right intention , while material gain or maintaining economies is not ; probability of success : arms may not be used in a futile cause or in a case where disproportionate measures are required to achieve success ; ; last resort : force may be used only after all peaceful and viable alternatives have been seriously tried and exhausted or are clearly not practical once war has begun , just war theory ( jus in bello ) also directs how combatants are to act or should act : ; distinction : just war conduct should be governed by the principle of distinction an attack or action must be intended to help in the defeat of the enemy ; it must be an attack on a legitimate military target , and the harm caused to civilians or civilian property must be proportional and not excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated ; no means malum in se : combatants may not use weapons or other methods of warfare that are considered evil , such as mass rape , forcing enemy combatants to fight against their own side or using weapons whose effects can not be controlled ( e.g it is , through government labeling and public opinion , that people use jus post bellum to justify the pursuit of labeled terrorist for the safety of the government 's state in a modern context orend , who was one of the theorists mentioned earlier , proposes the following principles : ; just cause for termination : a state may terminate a war if there has been a reasonable vindication of the rights that were violated in the first place , and if the aggressor is willing to negotiate the terms of surrender alternatively , a state may end a war if it becomes clear that any just goals of the war can not be reached at all or can not be reached without using excessive force realism – the core proposition of realism is a skepticism as to whether moral concepts such as justice can be applied to the conduct of international affairs to the extent that this is interpreted as a legitimate government , this leaves little room for revolutionary war or civil war , in which an illegitimate entity may declare war for reasons that fit the remaining criteria of just war theory article 3 of the 1949 geneva conventions side-steps this issue by stating that if one of the parties to a civil war is a high contracting party ( in practice , the state recognized by the international community ) , both parties to the conflict are bound '' as a minimum , the following humanitarian provisions '' article 4 of the third geneva convention also makes clear that the treatment of prisoners of war is binding on both parties even when captured soldiers have an '' allegiance to a government or an authority not recognized by the detaining power '' consequentialism – the moral theory most frequently summarized in the words '' the end justifies the means '' , which tends to support the just war theory ( unless the just war causes less beneficial means to become necessary , which further requires worst actions for self-defense with bad consequences ) 1918 ) , ( describing a philosophy of war and just war concepts from a rosicrucian point of view ) kelsay , john ;
