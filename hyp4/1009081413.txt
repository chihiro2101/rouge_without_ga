in some ciliates , like stylonychia and paramecium , only uga is decoded as a stop codon , while uag and uaa are reassigned as sense codons ( that is , when a standard amino acid is 'encoded ' by a stop codon ) , coding for the amino acid glutamic acid the beat of each cilium has two phases : a fast '' effective stroke '' , during which the cilium is relatively stiff , followed by a slow '' recovery stroke '' , during which the cilium curls loosely to one side and sweeps forward in a counter-clockwise fashion in some species , such as the well studied paramecium tetraurelia , the asexual line of clonally aging paramecia loses vitality and expires after about 200 fissions if the cells fail to undergo autogamy or conjugation when it happens to encounter an obstacle , the '' effective stroke '' of its cilia is reversed and the organism swims backward for a brief time , before resuming its forward progress joblot gave this creature the name , or '' slipper '' , and the phrase '' slipper animalcule '' remained in use as a colloquial epithet for paramecium , throughout the 18th and 19th centuries to gather food , the paramecium makes movements with cilia to sweep prey organisms , along with some water , through the oral groove ( vestibulum , or vestibule ) , and into the cell the densely arrayed cilia move in a coordinated fashion , with waves of activity moving across the '' ciliary carpet '' , creating an effect sometimes likened to that of the wind blowing across a field of grain the name '' paramecium '' – constructed from the greek ( paramēkēs , '' oblong '' ) – was coined in 1752 by the english microscopist john hill , who applied the name generally to '' animalcules which have no visible limbs or tails , and are of an irregularly oblong figure '' in 1718 , the french mathematics teacher and microscopist louis joblot published a description and illustration of a microscopic ( fish ) , which he discovered in an infusion of oak bark in water müller , the first researcher to place the genus within the linnaean system of taxonomy , adopted the name paramecium , but changed the spelling to paramœcium during either of these processes , the micronuclei of the cell ( s ) undergo meiosis , the old macronucleus disintegrates and a new macronucleus is formed by replication of the micronuclear dna that had recently undergone meiosis these findings further solidify that clonal aging is due , in large part , to a progressive accumulation of dna damage ; and that rejuvenation is due to the repair of this damage in the micronucleus during meiosis ehrenberg , in a major study of the infusoria published in 1838 , restored hill 's original spelling for the genus name , and most researchers have followed his lead however , another study in 2017 suggested that the paramecia can only learn to associate the bright side of its swimming medium to electric current and not the dark side between the alveolar sacs of the pellicle , most species of paramecium have closely spaced spindle-shaped trichocysts , explosive organelles that discharge thin , non-toxic filaments , often used for defensive purposes however , a study published in 2006 seems to show that paramecium caudatum may be trained , through the application of a 6.5 volt electric current , to discriminate between brightness levels like all ciliates , paramecium has a dual cell nucleus , consisting of a polyploid macronucleus , and one or more diploid micronuclei
