in sailing , a full-rigged brig is a vessel with two square rigged masts ( fore and main ) brig sails are named after the masts to which they are attached : the mainsail ; above that the main topsail ; above that the main topgallant sail ; and occasionally a very small sail , called the royal , is above that behind the main sail there is a small fore-and-aft sail called the spanker or boom mainsail ( it is somewhat similar to the main sail of a schooner ) attached to the respective yards of square-rigged ships are smaller spars , which can be extended , thus lengthening the yard , thus receiving an additional sailing wing on each side a brig is '' generally built on a larger scale than a schooner , and may approach the magnitude of a full-sized , three-masted ship historically , most brigs were made of wood , although some later brigs were built with hulls and masts of steel or iron the word '' brig '' has been used in the past as an abbreviation of brigantine ( which is the name for a two-masted vessel with foremast fully square rigged and her mainmast rigged with both a fore-and-aft mainsail , square topsails and possibly topgallant sails ) the square-rigged brig 's advantage over the fore-and-aft rigged brigantine was '' that the sails , being smaller and more numerous , are more easily managed , and require fewer men or 'hands ' to work them '' the variant was so popular that the term '' brig '' came to exclusively signify a ship with this type of rigging while their use stretches back before the 17th century , one of the most famous periods for the brig was during the 19th century when they were involved in famous naval battles such as the battle of lake erie it was seen as '' fast and well sailing '' , but required a large crew to handle its rigging while brigs could not sail into the wind as easily as fore-and-aft–rigged vessels such as schooners , a trait that is common to all square-rigged ships , a skilled brig captain could '' manoeuvre it with ease and elegance ; a brig could for instance turn around almost on the spot '' a brig 's square-rig also had the advantage over a fore-and-aft–rigged vessel when travelling offshore , in the trade winds , where vessels sailed down wind for extended distances and where '' the danger of a sudden jibe was the large schooner-captain 's nightmare '' the need for large crews in relation to their relatively small size led to the decline of the production of brigs on may 14 , 1829 mercury engaged in an uneven battle against 2 turkish ships of the line , selimiye ( 110 guns ) and real-bei ( 74 guns ) and emerged victorious from that battle , damaging both turkish sufficiently to be not able to chase mercury and disengaging the battle the cargo brig pilgrim , whose 1834 trading voyage from boston , massachusetts to california is described in the book two years before the mast she was deployed as a survey vessel to survey the coasts of south america , australia , and africa wharton , one of the vessels of the second texas navy , which participated in the naval battle of campeche , which is the only historical example of a steam navy having been defeated by a sail navy the telos , built in bangor , maine in 1883 , was reportedly the last brig to join the american merchant marine , and was '' considered to be the finest vessel of her class ever constructed in maine '' 10 the famous mystery ship mary celeste , while sometimes called a brig , was clearly a brigantine
