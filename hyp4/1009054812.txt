digestion is separated into four steps : ingestion : placing food into the mouth ( entry of food in the digestive system ) , mechanical and chemical breakdown : mastication and the mixing of the resulting bolus with water , acids , bile and enzymes in the stomach and intestine to break down complex molecules into simple structures , absorption : of nutrients from the digestive system to the circulatory and lymphatic capillaries through osmosis , active transport , and diffusion , and egestion ( excretion ) : removal of undigested materials from the digestive tract through defecation protein digestion occurs in the stomach and duodenum in which 3 main enzymes , pepsin secreted by the stomach and trypsin and chymotrypsin secreted by the pancreas , break down food proteins into polypeptides that are then broken down by various exopeptidases and dipeptidases into amino acids digestion of fats ( triacylglycerols ) the presence of fat in the small intestine produces hormones that stimulate the release of pancreatic lipase from the pancreas and bile from the liver which helps in the emulsification of fats for absorption of fatty acids this is the ability of sensation when chewing , for example if we were to bite into something too hard for our teeth , such as a chipped plate mixed in food , our teeth send a message to our brain and we realise that it can not be chewed , so we stop trying in a plant such as the venus flytrap that can make its own food through photosynthesis , it does not eat and digest its prey for the traditional objectives of harvesting energy and carbon , but mines prey primarily for essential nutrients ( nitrogen and phosphorus in particular ) that are in short supply in its boggy , acidic habitat fibre , especially cellulose and hemi-cellulose , is primarily broken down into the volatile fatty acids , acetic acid , propionic acid and butyric acid in these chambers ( the reticulo-rumen ) by microbes : ( bacteria , protozoa , and fungi ) food is formed into a bolus by the mechanical mastication and swallowed into the esophagus from where it enters the stomach through the action of peristalsis in this process , enzymes are secreted into the environment surrounding the organism , where they break down an organic material , and some of the products diffuse back to the organism the liver secretes bile into the duodenum to neutralize the acidic conditions from the stomach , and the pancreatic duct empties into the duodenum , adding bicarbonate to neutralize the acidic chyme , thus creating a neutral environment animals have a tube ( gastrointestinal tract ) in which internal digestion occurs , which is more efficient because more of the broken down products can be captured , and the internal chemical environment can be more efficiently controlled in mammals , preparation for digestion begins with the cephalic phase in which saliva is produced in the mouth and digestive enzymes are produced in the stomach this cavity has only one opening to the outside that functions as both a mouth and an anus : waste and undigested matter is excreted through the mouth/anus , which can be described as an incomplete gut in others , once potential nutrients or food is inside the organism , digestion can be conducted to a vesicle or a sac-like structure , through a tube , or through several specialized organs aimed at making the absorption of nutrients more efficient gastrin – is in the stomach and stimulates the gastric glands to secrete pepsinogen ( an inactive form of the enzyme pepsin ) and hydrochloric acid in the first two chambers , the rumen and the reticulum , the food is mixed with saliva and separates into layers of solid and liquid material cholecystokinin ( cck ) – is in the duodenum and stimulates the release of digestive enzymes in the pancreas and stimulates the emptying of bile in the gall bladder in the stomach further release of enzymes break down the food further and this is combined with the churning action of the stomach for example , trypsin is secreted by pancreas in the form of trypsinogen , which is activated in the duodenum by enterokinase to form trypsin in the small intestine , the larger part of digestion takes place and this is helped by the secretions of bile , pancreatic juice and intestinal juice the tongue is skeletal muscle on the floor of the mouth of most vertebrates , that manipulates food for chewing ( mastication ) and swallowing ( deglutition ) to digest vitamin b 12 non-destructively , haptocorrin in saliva strongly binds and protects the b 12 molecules from stomach acid as they enter the stomach and are cleaved from their protein complexes food digestion physiology varies between individuals and upon other factors such as the characteristics of the food and size of the meal , and the process of digestion normally takes between 24 and 72 hours gastric juice contains hydrochloric acid and pepsin which would damage the walls of the stomach and mucus is secreted for protection it serves primarily as a site for acid hydrolysis of microbial and dietary protein , preparing these protein sources for further digestion and absorption in the small intestine when the churning is complete , the glands in the walls of the gizzard add enzymes to the thick paste , which helps chemically breakdown the organic matter after the b 12 -haptocorrin complexes pass from the stomach via the pylorus to the duodenum , pancreatic proteases cleave haptocorrin from the b 12 molecules which rebind to intrinsic factor ( if ) acidity in the stomach is not buffered by food at this point and thus acts to inhibit parietal ( secretes acid ) and g cell ( secretes gastrin ) activity via d cell secretion of somatostatin gastric acid is about 0.5 % hydrochloric acid ( hcl ) , which lowers the ph to the desired ph of 1–3 secretin – is in the duodenum and signals the secretion of sodium bicarbonate in the pancreas and it stimulates the bile secretion in the liver the intestinal walls are lined with villi , and their epithelial cells is covered with numerous microvilli to improve the absorption of nutrients by increasing the surface area of the intestine it is a simple system , which consists of only three protein subunits : the abc protein , membrane fusion protein ( mfp ) , and outer membrane protein ( omp ) the mouth is surrounded by strong lips , which act like a hand to grab pieces of dead grass , leaves , and weeds , with bits of soil to help chew ti and ri transfer between bacteria uses an independent system ( the tra , or transfer , operon ) from that for inter-kingdom transfer ( the vir , or virulence , operon ) mechanical and chemical digestion begin in the mouth where food is chewed , and mixed with saliva to begin enzymatic processing of starches to aid in the digestion of their food , animals evolved organs such as beaks , tongues , radulae , teeth , crops , gizzards , and others this acidity confers two benefits : it denatures proteins for further digestion in the small intestines , and provides innate immune system , damaging or eliminating various pathogens it was discovered in agrobacterium tumefaciens , which uses this system to introduce the ti plasmid and proteins into the host , which develops the crown gall ( tumor ) the sublingual route takes advantage of the highly vascular quality of the oral cavity , and allows for the speedy application of medication into the cardiovascular system , bypassing the gastrointestinal tract teeth ( singular tooth ) are small whitish structures found in the jaws ( or mouths ) of many vertebrates that are used to tear , scrape , milk and chew food examples may be seen in humans , who differ considerably from other hominids ( lack of hair , smaller jaws and musculature , different dentition , length of intestines , cooking , etc complete digestion of one molecule of fat ( a triglyceride ) results a mixture of fatty acids , mono- and di-glycerides , as well as some undigested triglycerides , but no free glycerol molecules it is stimulated by distension of the stomach , presence of food in stomach and decrease in ph
